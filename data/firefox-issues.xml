      <title>JS errors and strict warnings in dialog "Download actions"</title>
      <description>The dialog for viewing and editing download actions within the preferences has
several js errors and warnings. It's really simple to replicate.

1. Open the dialog
2. Enter a search term
3. Double click somewhere inside the tree.

Because a non-existing entry is selected, following errors and warnings are shown:

Warning: reference to undefined property this.activeCollection[aIndex]
Source File: chrome://browser/content/preferences/downloadactions.js
Line: 365

Warning: trailing comma is not legal in ECMA-262 object initializers

Source File: chrome://browser/content/preferences/changeaction.js

Hitting "Clear" after that, this strict warning appears:

      <title>UI for logging out of sites using HTTP authentication/phishing attack preventer</title>
      <description>Bug 55181 gave the ability to log out of all sites using HTTP authentication,
Bug 260839 (in Core: Networking) is about making it possible for just one site,
this bug is about having a good UI for doing so.

I described at http://dolphinling.net/firefox/httpauthui what I think is a good
UI for logging out of websites using HTTP authentication. I've gotten a few
positive comments on it, so I'm hoping it can get into Firefox.

A short description (a more detailed one is in the link above): 

When someone logs into a website using HTTP auth, the username is displayed in
the right side of the address bar, in some visually distinct way (like having a
box around it). When this box is clicked (or right clicked, or tabbed to + enter
for accessibility) a menu is displayed, with an option to log out. 

This is intuitive and discoverable but not intrusive, and hopefully therefore
good UI. 

It also has the added benefit that it can help prevent phishing attacks of the
form http://www.somebank.com@evilphishingsite.net/, since www.somebank.com is
moved away and all that's displayed in the normal location for URLs is
http://evilphishingsite.net/.

P.S. Please no comments about 300000th bug. It's a legitimate bug and discussion
should be on topic. As gerv said
(http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/gerv/archives/007616.html) "Let's party

      <title>XUL error pages should not have chrome privileges</title>
      <description>User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.8b2) Gecko/20050707 Firefox/1.0+

XUL error pages should not have chrome privileges because any untrusted
content can and should be able to load the error pages. The error pages
are used by the default in recent Firefox trunk (bug 216466). So exploits
can load the error pages automatically and abuse its elevated privileges
by bugs such as XSS in Mozilla.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:

Actual Results:  
XUL error pages have chrome privileges.

Expected Results:  
XUL error pages DOES NOT have chrome privileges.</description>

      <title>Bidi: LTR characters typed at the right edge of RTL text appear to the left of that text</title>
      <description>In a textarea which contains bidirectional text, use the right arrow key to move
to the right edge of an RTL phrase which is followed by LTR text.
Then, when you type LTR (or even neutral) characters, they appear to the left of
the RTL text (while the caret remains at the right edge of that text).

Moving the caret one character further to the right and typing RTL text, the RTL
text appears to the left of the existing RTL text (once again, the caret remains
at its place).

Testcase will follow soon.</description>

      <title>"cookies need value" error code when a query returns an empty result.</title>
      <description>User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041223 Firefox/1.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041223 Firefox/1.0

With the latest tip, I'm seeing a cookies_need_value error code when a query
returns an empty list.  That's because Bugzilla::CGI::send_cookie is expecting a
value for the "-value" key, but buglist is sending an empty string.

I don't know what's the best way to fix it, but will enclose a simple patch that
worked for me. 

This is probably a show stopper for 2.20.  Apologies if this is a dup, couldn't
find a related ticket.

supports them even if the sites using (and users reading) those feeds are minority.

      <title>Canceling a HTTP request while it is reading a partial cache entry does not cancel the corresponding transaction</title>
      <description>Canceling a HTTP request while it is reading a partial cache entry does not
cancel the corresponding transaction.

When a HTTP range request is used to complete a partial cache entry, we first
issue a range request and if we get back a 206, then we read the cache and send
the partial cache data to our listener.  If the listener cancels the channel by
returning an error code (e.g., NS_BINDING_ABORTED) from their OnDataAvailable,
then the network transaction will never be closed.  It will just sit around,
consuming a persistent connection.  If this process is repeated, then subsequent
requests to the same host may get stuck waiting for an available persistent
connection.</description>

      <title>Mailwindow freezes / doesn't redraw after Thunderbird main window closed</title>
      <description>User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4
Build Identifier: Thunderbird version 1.0+ (20050630)

When sending a mail that takes longer than a wink (so long that you can
reproduce the following), you can close the main app window and the contents of
the send-progress-dialog and the write mail window will disappear and all get white.

the progress goes on and the mail will be sent away... but you cannot see that.
it seems as if thunderbird hung up.

when taking another window and pulling it above the "new message" window, the
contents of the new window appear as "ghosts" in the mail window.

you can get back to see the contents when "starting" thunderbird in the meantime
again... so you will see that progress has gone on and now you can read your
mail you are actually sending away, again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Thunderbird
2. Perhaps get messages, then write a new mail
3. Attach a file to the new message so it will take longer to get the mail sent out
4. Send the mail...
5. While sending mail, close the Thunderbird Main Window...
6. New Mail and Sned progress window will get white and content will not reappear
7. Now Open Thunderbird Main window again (by "starting" the app)
8. Main window reappears and the two other windows will be redrawn again



Expected Results:  
Firefox handles this when opening the download progress window and closing all
browser windows with a dialog like: "shall stop and close downloads, too?"

for thunderbird it would be great that the actual progress would be finished and
then the app be exited normally.</description>

The string in the locale for reporting broken web pages is the same both for the
menuitem and the button in the toolbar. In the italian translation (but I think
others will have this problem) the text of the string is quite long. While there
are no problem for the menuitem, such a long text make the button in the toolbar
too big, as you can see here: http://s05.imagehost.org/1250/brokenwebsite.png
and it's quite awful to see.
If you separate strings for menuitem and button, we will be able to make button
text shorter and let the button size be normal.

When I double-click on a mail in the main list, it takes over 1.5 seconds until

window, then hit enter again, it still takes almost 1 second to re-open it.

loads, or an image is broken, you see those old Netscape-icons again. This
shouldn't be. Everything in the /res folder should be themeable and not saved in

This means images like broken-image.gif or loading-image.gif should be dependant
of the theme that is used.

      <description>I tracked down a newer version of editline than the one we use, and after
reading the diffs between the newer version and our version it became apparent
that the only real differences were:
- mccabe removed the tab-completion stuff. Bringing it back now seems pointless.
- a potential crash fix if tgetstr() returned NULL. I'll slip that into this
patch for completeness.
- by going back in history and typing the last line in history, it is possible
to add non-unique entries to the line history back-to-back. The fix is fairly
trivial.

Unfortunately, there weren't any fixes for the wrapping problem that Brendan and
I both see. I may take a crack at that to see if I can dig anything up, later.</description>

as an attachment of type Application/X-VND.MOZILLA.MAYBE-TEXT (not understood

      <title>Refactor intrinsic width computation out of nsIFrame::Reflow</title>
      <description>This bug describes a design change that I've been talking about for a
while (see various posts to mozilla-layout).  Many bugs likely to be
fixed by this change have "[reflow-refactor]" in the Status Whiteboard.
I've been working on the changes on various REFLOW_{YYYYMMDD}_BRANCH
branches.

The basic idea to make two closely related changes at the same time:
 1. Change intrinsic width computation so that it happens in separate
    methods on nsIFrame.  (Currently preferred with calculation using
    the nsIFrame API can happen in two different ways as well:  having
    only one codepath reduces incremental layout ("{inc}") bugs.)
 2. Change the way we handle incremental layout to use dirty bits on the
    frames rather than the reflow tree (which is essentially out-of-line
    dirty bits) and a complicated system of reflow reasons that often
    leads to weird incremental layout ("{inc}") bugs.

I hope to add more details of the new design here in the near future.
Much of it is still open to change; at this point the branch is close to
compiling and probably a ways from working, so the cost of changing
things is still relatively low.</description>

If an HTML form generates a page with content-type text/plain using HTTP POST,
it can be printed correctly. However, if the page is saved to a file or sent as
an email attachment, the page is re-requested using HTTP GET with no arguments.
Typically this results in a blank form

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Submit a form using HTTP POST (in the test URL, POST, Display Text)
2.Save page
3.

Actual Results:  
The saved page is missing the information posted in the form

Expected Results:  
The saved page would be identical to the screen contents, and would not
generate a second HTTP POST operation. If the page was cacheable, was cached and
not expired, the cached copy could be used.



The browser sends an HTTP HEAD request before the GET request.
If the page is cacheable, the saved page is stale (it has an earlier date
than that on the screen)

Firefox 1.0.4 behaves the same for text/plain as for text/html, i.e. it
does a second POST operation and the saved file is "correct", in that
it has the correct form fields. However this is also a bug (submitted separately)</description>

      <title>clearing cache should remove directory, not delete files</title>
      <description>clearing the disk cache, especially if set to the 50mb default, takes forever,
at least on windows machines.  this is particularly concerning after a crash,
because moz will freeze up while it slowly clears the cache after first starting
up after a crash (different bug altogether).

i believe that this is because moz deletes the cache file by file, using the
equivalent of the old dos "del"/"erase" command.  a much simpler and faster way
of clearing the cache would be to remove the cache *directory* altogether, and
then recreate the cache directory, rather than trying to delete the files
contained there.  this is what i usually do after a (non-moz related) crash to
prevent moz from freezing up when starting up again.  the delay experienced when
clearing the cache can be "replicated" by dropping into dos and clearing the
cache with the "del *.*" command.

okay, this isn't a very well-worded bug description, i apologize.  hopefully it
makes sense.</description>

A "box in a box" is not rendered properly. I usually do this with nested &lt;div
style=something&gt;, which is in agreement with HTML and CSS definitions. I wrote a
brief HTML code section and tried various alignments (defined by CSS styles).
Gecko ignores them, including width definitions. I am under the impression that
CSS is largely ignored, in style= definitions, class= definitions, and in
stylesheets, I tried them all.
It looks like a lack of implementation of both the HTML box model, as well as
lack of CSS implementation.

A Web form is filled in and submitted with action=post. The resulting page
is required to be sent to someone. If it is printed out and sent by surface mail,
everything is fine. If in Mozilla the user clicks "Send Page"  to send it as
email a second POST operation is performed to get the source code again.
Similarly if the user clicks "Save As File" in FireFox or Mozilla a second
POST is performed with no popup or alert box appearing

The second POST violates the principle that all POST operations should be in
response to an explicit user request, since they may make a payment, turn on a
motor, launch a missile or perform some other operation that should not be
duplicated

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Submit a web form using POST
2.Save the resulting page to file
3.Check webserver logs

Actual Results:  
The browser sends a HEAD request followed by a second POST operation

Expected Results:  
Saved the page to file using the cached copy. If the page was not cacheable,
the user should be given a dialogue "the page you are trying to save
contains POST data ..." before a second POST is performed. Ideally, the browser
should just be able to save what is on the screen, in the same way as it
can save it to PostScript when print is requested., without doing any other
HTTP operations

Firefox performs like this for text/plain, HTML and PNG.
Mozilla instead does a GET request for text/plain and PNG, but does the second
POST operation for HTML</description>

confusing. The UI gives little indication of what the button does. Does it

We need to replace that UI. Maybe we should just do what Windows does, maybe
something else...

of it!!  What's up with that??

I have loaded latest versions, it is calling for an earlier obsolete version. 
Can't override this, poorly done installer here.

Everything else works great!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to site and click on "play movie"
2. Firefox say plug-in not found, prompts to load it.
3. Dies at this point, nothing works, I've tried it all.

Actual Results:  
Says "click here to install plugin", says quicktime plugin available, click next
and says it is installing it (it doesn't), click next says apple finished
installing plugin, and that it is also missing.  Click manual install, doesn't
solve problem.

Expected Results:  
Not used quicktime as default!!!  Build in Flash player for videos, audios!

This is a glaring hole in an otherwise great product - why won't you guys fix
this???</description>

      <title>SSL client cache size should be bounded</title>
      <description>We have already seen an issue before where the SSL client-side cache would grow
apparently without bounds, because some sessions were being stored into it that
could never be restarted. Those sessions were not getting freed until the next
day, after the SSL session expired. This issue was 
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=273993 . The fix that was done was
to stop storing those useless sessions.

We now have another problem, which I discovered while coding my strsclnt
enhancements as part of bug 292151 .

Using SSL_SetSocketPeerID, it is possible to split the client cache into
different compartments. The feature is used in clients when connecting to
different hosts through a proxy for example. The problem is that the
compartments never get freed until the sessions expire, even if they are no
longer used. IMO, this is a major problem. It prevents me from using this
feature in strsclnt to resume a recent session.

But the problem isn't specific to this strsclnt case. It really applies to any
client application. Unlike the SSL server cache, the SSL client cache size isn't
limited . There is no API currently to set it upfront.

I haven't found an API to set the lifetime of client-side SSL sessions either.
If there is one, it could mitigate the problem quite a bit, since the purge
routine could take care of the issue without having to set an absolute size
limit on the client cache.</description>

      <description>User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8b2) Gecko/20050707 Camino/0.9a1+
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8b2) Gecko/20050707 Camino/0.9a1+

If I drag an image from Camino to iPhoto 5 in the dock and iPhoto is not started
I crash the dock and then proceed to beachball Camino.  This leads to all
applications becomming hung and then to complete system stablity problems
(beachballs on all apps) requiring a reboot.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Launch Camino
2.  Drag image to iPhoto 5 icon in dock (iPhoto not running)

Actual Results:  
Dock crashes and restarts.  Camino continues with a beachball with all
applications becoming unstable shortly thereafter resulting in the need for a
reboot to regain stablity.

Expected Results:  
iPhoto should launch and import the photo to the libary.  Expected results can
be seen with Safari.</description>

      <title>SSL client cache only works within a process</title>
      <description>In a multi-process client application, NSS maintains separate client caches for
each process. Thus, the performance will be lower, and many more full handshakes
will occur than necessary, because new SSL connections made in one process will
not be able to reuse SSL sessions created with the same host in another process .</description>

      <title>Use -dead_strip as a linker flag for mac builds</title>
      <description>-dead_strip works similarly to MSVC's /OPT:REF in that it discards all functions
and data which are not reachable from the exported functions of a binary.  This
allows us to strip out some of the "extra" constructors and destructors that are
emitted for classes, as well as functions that are just never called.  In my
test, this yields a couple hundred KB savings for a static firefox-bin.</description>

      <title>SOAP requests do not return cookies</title>
      <description>User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050513 Fedora/1.0.4-1.3.1 Firefox/1.0.4
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050513 Fedora/1.0.4-1.3.1 Firefox/1.0.4

SOAP requests do not return cookies when either the cookie was already set for
the SOAP URI or when included in the HTTP headers of a SOAP response. The
demonstrating URL above is the lead-in page for a SOAP demo program. The
application server attempts to set a cookie named "BISKit" to identify further
requests (that return the cookie). Since the cookie is not returned for SOAP
requests, each response sets a new value for this cookie.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the demonstration URL and run the demo.
2. Monitor the HTTP headers and note that the BISKit cookie is never returned
with SOAP requests and changes value in every response.

Actual Results:  
No cookie is returned in the HTTP headers of SOAP requests even though a cookie
is set for the root directory of the server. Note that the demo is written to
not depend on the cookie being returned, so it still works even though a new
application server instance must be started for every request.

Expected Results:  
Applicable cookies should be returned in the HTTP headers just as they are for
any other HTTP-based request.

Tried on both Linux (Fedora Core 3) and Windows XP with Firefox 1.04 with the
same results.</description>

Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.8b2) Gecko/20050516 Firefox/1.0+

CSS added the notion of overflow, which allows one to define how overflow should
be handled. An example of overflow would be a div with a specified height, and
its contents are taller than that height. The CSS standard defines that if this
happens and no overflow behavior is set, the contents of the div will overflow.
However, Internet Explorer does not comply with this, and will expand the div
beyone its set height inorder to hold the contents. Below is an example:

&lt;div style="height:100px; border: 1px solid black;"&gt;
&lt;div style="height:150px; border: 1px solid red; margin:10px;"&gt;a&lt;/div&gt;

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Subscribe to many feeds and set them to fill one folder
2. Get new feed messages
3. Click on the feed folder

Actual Results:  
The message appear jumbled and it's unclear which belongs to which feed

Expected Results:  
Being able to group by or sort by the feed title would be ideal.</description>

      <description>if would be cool if mozilla could warn a user in the javascript console of
multiple use of id's
like the following html:
&lt;div id="test"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="test"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

a warning could be written to the console saying:

Whenever I add a add an attachmend to a mail (mail compose window), the filename
is changed to "me". My Username, in fact, is "me#". (I could kill me for
accidently tap on "#" before "enter" while entering the username; however, the

This probably has something to do with bug #288424 ?

http://kb.mozillazine.org/Dev_:_Extensions_:_Example_Code_:_On_Tab_Load

I have been using the code from that site to trigger a page onload event.
However, I have found that sometimes this does not work. Through the use of
alert boxes I have found that it fails on this line:

var doc = aEvent.originalTarget;

I get this to fail sometimes on Mozilla 1.8 and on the trunk builds but have
never been able to reproduce the problem on Firefox 1.0.x or Mozilla 1.7.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Adblock Plus from http://bene.sitesled.com/install.htm
2. Create this filter /(dynamic|text)ad/
3. Visit http://www.windowsitpro.com/windowspaulthurrott/

Actual Results:  
The online monthly pass ad and the tech jobs at dice ad in the articles are
removed only sometimes. And when it fails clicking on the Adblock text at the
bottom of the browser to bring up Adblock-able items does not show any DIV nodes
like it does when it works.

Expected Results:  
This should consistently work and not sometimes.

Where this is coded in Adblock Plus is in the adblock.xul file which should call
the removeUnwantedDivs function near the top of the component.js file.</description>

Firefox 1.0.4).

1. Create a test account on www.viacontext.com
2. Login with your test account and click on your personal archive folder
3. Choose the second upload option (Upload multiple files), which will load the
applet and show the security alert.

Actual Results:  
The security alert describes the issuer as non-trustworthy

Expected Results:

      <title>redo spell-as-you-type when language is chnaged</title>
      <description>Thunderbird version 1.0+ (20050626)

When you use the spell-check dialog, and you change the language, you have the
option to recheck the entire page. this is handy is you keep switching between
differetn languages, and you started to type a message in a different language
than the default (the spell checker suddenly started to complain about almost
every word).

But when you use spell-as-you-type, and you notice that almost every word is
flagged as incorrect, you can change the language in the Options or the
Spell-Check dialog. But when you changed the language, the page isn't rechecked,
and you notice that the words stay flagged as incorrect.

For example (assuming that you have installed English and Dutch dictionaries):
- switch on spell-as-you-type
- set the language to English
- type "dit is een test" (Dutch for "this is a test")
- notice that 3 words out of 4 are incorrect
- open the spell-check dialog and change the language to Dutch
- notice that the words stay flagged

Work around :
- switch off spell-as-you-type
- switch it back on

      <title>Can't Tab between buttons in Remember Password dialog.</title>
      <description>User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8b2) Gecko/20050706 Camino/0.9a1+
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8b2) Gecko/20050706 Camino/0.9a1+

In OSX (10.4 Tiger), I have "Full Keyboard Access" turned on, which allows me to
tab between all controls on the current window (text boxes, lists, radio
buttons, check boxes, etc).  However, in Camino, when the "Remember Password"
dialog box appears, it is not possible to tab off of the default selection. 
Also, there is no "alternative" selection available; i.e., usually when a dialog
box comes up, you can press enter to accept the blue button, or spacebar to
accept the blue-outlined button, however, there is only a blue button (Remember
Password) in the Remember Password dialog.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Turn on Full Keyboard Access in the Mac OSX "Keyboard &amp; Mouse" preferences.
2. Start Camino and navigate to a site with username and password text boxes
where Camino would ask whether it should save the password.
3. Submit the form.
Actual Results:  
The "Remember Password" dialog will appear, with the option "Remember Password"
as the default (enter-enabled) selection.  There is no "Haloed"
(spacebar-enabled) selection.  Additionally, pressing the Tab key does not
change focus to the other buttons.

Expected Results:  
The "Remember Password" dialog should appear, but pressing the Tab key should
have the "Halo" effect cycle through the buttons, making them spacebar-enabled.
 Also, the "Don't Remember" button should probably be the default
spacebar-enabled button.</description>

      <title>'You have requested an encrypted page' message steals focus when opening a new tab, interfering with 'off' position of 'Select new tabs opened from links'</title>
      <description>Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8b2) Gecko/20050702

I have the 'Select new tabs opened from links' option switched off, so that I
can work down a page opening links on it and then read the pages.  This normally
works well, but when the target URLs are https, the security alert steals the
focus and interferes with the process.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Have 'Select new tabs opened from links' switched off.
2. Go to a secure site, e.g. Bugzilla.
3. Try to open several links in new tabs, e.g. bug pages from a query page.

Actual results:
'You have requested an encrypted page' message comes up on the new tabs, seizing
the focus from the tab on which I was opening links.

Expected results:
Maybe pop up the security message when I first switch to the new tab?

Dealing with bug 156758/bug 160195 would stop it happening in the example I
gave, but not with the general case (in which secure tabs may be opened from an
insecure page).</description>

      <description>When I update today (0708) from yesterday's nightly, I get to download the new

if the update process stalls, and update window closed, deer park hangs on next
attempt in a "paused" mode, which now you freezes you out of re-trying the
update process, even on restart of deer park

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. sometime when updating cannot find server, give up and close update window
2. re-try update, it hangs is "Paused" mode
3.

Actual Results:  
hung up for good

Expected Results:  
let user re-try updating

Temporary Work-Around:

you can unfreeze the "Paused" mode, and reset the updating process, so it will
work again, by first closing deer park, then deleting the updates.xml and

      <title>regression: Tab close button draws over top of scroll bar of first tab after closing second tab, when page has focus</title>
      <description>This appeared between the 20050621 and 20050622 Deer Park nightlies, which is
the same time as bug 298677. Whether it's related to the same CFRunLoop checkin,
I have no idea.

To reproduce:
- Ensure your preference is set to have the tab bar vanish when only one tab is open
- Open a page long enough to produce a vertical scroll bar
- Open a second tab. A blank page is fine. The tab bar pops up
- By default, the focus in the new tab is in the location bar. Click somewhere
in the blank page so that the location bar loses the focus
- Close the tab either by clicking the close button or by hitting cmd-w
- First tab should now be in the foreground and the tab bar should have
vanished, as normal. 
- Regard the top of the vertical scroll bar... an artefact consisting of the tab
close button should appear over the top of it. The scroll bar redraws properly
if you mouse over it.</description>

I use the following HTML to create a form element with two additional attributes
ie Slot and BookingID **Note these are not standard elements of the object**

&lt;input type="hidden"  size="3" Slot="AM" BookingID="43"  name="hdn_182_AM"
value="123" &gt;

I then access the attributes in JS useing code

Slot =  f.elements['hdn_182_AM'].Slot;
BookingID = f.elements['hdn_182_AM'].BookingID;
value = f.elements['hdn_182_AM'].value;

Under IE ,Slot = "AM" , BookingID = "43" and value = "123"

Under FireFox Slot = "Undefined" , BookingID = "Undefined" and value = "123"


Should FireFox recoginise the 'adhoc' attributes and handle this code in the
same way that IE does?

Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4

I'd like to suggest a way to prevent useless chatter on bugs.  A lot of time
spam comments such as "I really want this fixed!" that don't really contribute
to the fixing of the bug show up on bugzilla.  What if there was a link from the
bug to an "official" forum topic somewhere?  It could be prominent enough at the
top of the bug that newbies might be directed there.  e.g. "If you have a
comment that isn't directly involved in fixing this bug, discuss it here."  It
could be an optional field for the bug filled by a priveleged user for
spam-problematic bugs.

It's not a perfect solution, but it might encourage people to use the forums if
they see that a particular forum topic is actually "official" or linked directly
from the bug in a prominent way.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
See any flame-worthy bug.

Actual Results:  
Lots of useless comments by people who just want to feel like they can voice
their opinion that the bug really frustrates them.

Expected Results:  
Frustrated users should be directed somewhere other than bugzilla to vent, so
bugzilla can stay focused on fixing the bug.</description>

Sometimes (often) the messages are counted twice - first when the messages are
moved, then as new messages in the folder. It looks like a race condition.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. have a rule that move some messages in IMAP account into a subfolder
2. set "check for new messages" on that folder
3. send a message that triggers the rule

Actual Results:  
often unread message count is twice the actual number in the target folder.

a &lt;select&gt; object renders css styles applied to the &lt;option&gt; tags great. 
However, when one of those &lt;option&gt;'s is selected, (e.g. displayed as the
selected option), the display of the &lt;select&gt; object, should reflect the
selected &lt;option&gt;.

(see attachment)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create an HTML select element, with css styles applied to 1 or more of the
option tags.
2. view page, select various options


Actual Results:  
The main &lt;select&gt; element remains un-styled/un-affected by selected &lt;option&gt; css
styles.

Expected Results:  
If the &lt;select&gt; object, has a size="1" (default), and is not a "multiple"
&lt;select&gt;, then *idealy* the select would "inherit" the selected child's styles.

The user "appears" to see the option that they selected, but styles are lost.

Note: some other browsers get this right, some don't, or only partially.
 IE: FG colors ok, BG colors ok, no fonts (size, style, or family) in options
and selected
 OP: no FG colors, no BG colors, no fonts (size, style, or family) in options
and selected
MOZ: in options:
       FG colors ok, BG colors ok, font (size, style, family) ALL Okay
     in selected:
       no FG colors, no BG colors, no fonts (size, style, or family)*
       *(select seems to grow to largest font size in list... IMHO, this appears
to be very strange)

I will be attaching a test case, and "faked" expected results.</description>

Even if no one reads the page before submitting the bug, it would still save

cancelled one by one, often asks for login again even though the previous login
was successful. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. configure Thunderbird to talk to an IMAP server via IMAP proxy (for example
SpamPal); set a minimal update interval (1 minute?);
2. open a folder
3. make server inaccessible (disconnect the cord);
4. login failed dialog should appear;
5. try to login,it should fail;
6. wait a little;
7. connect the cord back;
8. login again
Actual Results:  
you will be prompted again to login

Expected Results:  
the last result should be final - if either if Cancel is pressed or the last
login was successful - no more login requests should be open.

It looks like Thunderbird wants to separately report an error and ask to login
for every connection it makes, but sometimes I have to cancel more then 5 login
dialogs.</description>

Since 20050707 builds installing extensions by double clicking on the saved
filename.xpi is not possible anymore. Also after unsuccessful calling of the
xpinstall dialog dragging and dropping files (extensions) on the browser window
is not possible.
This bug is probably caused by the one of security bugs that were fixed in this
build (bug 298255 and bug 298892).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Try to install saved extension by double clicking on it
(browser.link.open_external:1) = Tools -&gt; Options... -&gt; Tabs - 'Open links from
other applications in:' - 'the most recent tab/window'

Actual Results:  
The XPInstall dialog does not show -&gt; extension can not be installed.

Expected Results:  
The XPInstall dialog does show and allows to install the extension.</description>

      <title>nsXPInstallManager::OnDataAvailable may consume more data than expected</title>
      <description>nsXPInstallManager::OnDataAvailable may consume more data than expected.

The code reads data from the given stream into an 8k stack buffer.  If the
|length| parameter passed to OnDataAvailable is less than 8k and if the stream
contains more than |length| bytes, nsXPInstallManager will end up reading more
than the expected number of bytes from the stream.  In most cases this is not a
major problem for the caller; however, in this case it is a problem for
nsXPInstallManager because it decrements length by the number of bytes read from
the stream, and it does not stop reading until length reaches zero.  Since
length is an unsigned quantity, it is possible that reading more than length
bytes would result in length underflowing.  That in turn would cause
nsXPInstallManager to continue looping, and reading from the stream would likely
fail with an NS_BASE_STREAM_WOULD_BLOCK error, terminating the channel and
resulting in a failed XPI download.

This error probably occurs infrequently as additional data would have to arrive
at just the right time and be inserted into the data pipe at just the right
moment to trigger this bug.  But, the race condition does exist, so I'm sure
this bug must have impacted some user somewhere.</description>

      <title>Extension Manager only checks for updates for the selected extension</title>
      <description>Seen on both today's trunk and branch builds. 

STR:
1. Install the latest version of an extension (I used FlashGot)
2. Restart
3. Install an old version of an extension (ForecastFox in my case)
4. Restart
5. Open Extension Manager
6. Select the new extension and click update, see that no updates were found
7. Select the old extension and click update, the update is found

When the user clicks update, their intent is clearly to check for updates for
all installed extensions, there is no reason to check for updates to only one
extension at a time. Furthermore, the tooltip on the update button reads "checks
for updates to your extensions," indicating that the button will check for
updates to all extensions, not just the selected one.</description>

      <description>User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows ME) Opera 7.54  [de]
Build Identifier: version 1.0.5 (20050707)

If mail folder A is renamed to B and then a new folder A is created, TB displays 
that both folders would contain all the messages, which should only be in B.
In fact, only folder B really contains the messages. In folder A, you cannot 
open the mails. - The file A is 0kB and B 43kB.
OK, till now, it is a cosmetic problem which could be resolved by deleting A.
msf, I think.
But, if you delete folder A (which should be empty as it was created in the 
previous step), folder B is empty. All the messages are lost!
What i could see on the filesystem during these operations is very strange. I 
will print out the most important files (A*, B*) after each step:
**1** Create folder A and copy some mails into it:
A.sbd
A.msf  (3kB)
A     (43kB)
**2** Rename folder A to B:
A.sbd        &lt;- should be deleted?
A.msf  (3kB) &lt;- sometimes deleted, sometimes not (non-deterministic)
B.sbd
B.msf  (3kB)
B     (43kB)
**3** Create folder A:
A.sbd
A.msf  (3kB) &lt;- sometimes deleted, sometimes not (non-deterministic)
A      (0kB)
B.sbd
B.msf  (4kB) &lt;- 1kB more?
B     (43kB)
**4** Delete folder A and empty trash:
A      (0kB)
A.sbd

Bad, bad, bad...
Now TB displays only folder B, but the file system contains only the file A. So 
B is empty and undeletable in TB.

Besides this, I noticed non-deterministic behaviour reproducing the procedure 
again and again: After renaming A to B, TB displayed in most cases folder B, but 
sometimes folder A. Renaming this folder A to B again is not possible. This 
behaviour happened randomly.

All test have been performed in the "Local Folders". I don't know, if POP- or 
IMAP-accounts are affected. At least POP-accounts are very likely to be 
concerned.

Regards,
Michael

      <title>Streaming Quotes applet causes text insertion point to randomly jump one character left while typing.</title>
      <description>User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511

When I am running the streaming quotes Java applet from OptionsXpress the
insertion point randomly moves one character left during typing in any Mozilla
Address bar, text field, or email compose window, causing random characters to
get pushed to the end of the line. This problem becomes worse as I increase the
number of stocks listed in the streamer. I observed the problem with Java 1.3.1
and it is still reproducible with Java build 1.5.0_03-b07. An example of this
behavior is shown between the parenthesis below:

(The quick brow fox jumped over te lazy dog's backhn)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to https://www.optionsxpress.com and create an account(use bogus info if
desired... you will still be able to get in, though you will not be able to
trade. If you do not want to do this, contact me and I will set up a bogus
account for you)

2. Once you have gained access, click on the "Quote" tab then click on the
"Streaming" link. This will open the applet in a new window.

3. In the applet window, at the top left, is a text entry box. One after
another, enter at least 5 stock ticker symbols, clicking "Add" after entering
each one. Some valid tickers: GOOG, AAPL, DELL, TWX, TOL, VLO, BBY, SBUX

4. Now, open any web page with a textarea box, compose an email, or type in the
address bar. The problem should manifest by the time you have typed a couple of
sentences. Please note: I have also reproduced this problem on an XP machine
with the same Java versions.
Actual Results:  
As I mentioned before, the cursor makes random jumps one character to the left
while typing, pushing characters to the end of the line.

Expected Results:  
Text should appear as typed.

I'm using the Modern Theme. I will update later if I find that the behavior
changes with the Classic Theme(need to restart Mozilla).

Also, I thought I entered this bug a day or two ago, but I never received email
and I can't find it now. General Bugzilla searches seem to "Ponder" forever, and
I don't see it when I search for my bugs. Hopefully this one sticks.</description>

      <title>Carets from other tabs appear on the same tab when re-enabling caret browsing mode</title>
      <description>When multiple tabs are open in caret browsing mode, tuning caret browsing off
and then on again causes multiple cartes to appear on the same tab. The "ghost"
carets are blinking, and do not move as the page is scrolled.

Steps to reproduce:
0. Caret mode is off
1. Open two tabs, with a HTML page in each of them
2. Enable caret browsing mode (F7)
3. On each of the tabs, place the caret somewhere on the page
4. Disable caret browsing mode
5. Enable caret browsing mode

You will see that both carets appear, and thy are both blinking.
The same could be done with more than two tabs, resulting in more than two
blinking carets.

This seems to be an old bug (I can see it in Firefox 1.0), but I couldn't find a
duplicate.
Not sure if this is Mac-specific (can someone please try on other platforms?)

      <title>Support user defined workflow triggers based on request criteria</title>
      <description>overall concept:
what would it take to get bugzilla to support user defined triggers?
like "if someone marks flag+, set flag2?"

the triggers would have to be flagged by the user who defines them, the same way
they request a normal flag.

steps:
1. timeless defines rule [name] "timeless-1":
[condition] when
review+(matchbyname) and
superreview+(matchbyname) and
approval10[is not set](matchbyname)
[x] _set_ approval10?(matchbyname)
[x] send email
 [x] allow watchers to receive mail (* watchers will not receive mail if they
can not see the bug or attachment or flags)
[show for] products:all
bonus points: [x] display trigger to other users when it is selected

2. timeless edits an attachment (#100023) and checks review?, superreview?,
timeless-1+
3. lpsolit marks review+ (being in grant group for review+)
4. neil marks superreview+ (being in grant group for superreview+)
5. timeless-1 tries to trigger
it sees that timeless is in request group for approval10 and sets
timeless:approval10?
6. an email is sent to timeless and any watchers (who haven't opted out of
trigger mail)

about "matchbyname" this is to tolerate the fact that for product--all-- there
are a bunch of flags named "review" and it's ok for any of them to match.

the opposite of "matchbyname" is "matchbyid" which will let you specify a flag
and stick to the flag even if the flag changes names.</description>

      <title>need to refactor nsIFrame::PeekOffset</title>
      <description>Instead of being a deep-recursive, normal member function of nsFrame and its
inheritor classes, the following should happen:

- There should be an independent, or a static member of nsFrame, function called
'GetNext' or 'GetNextItem'.
- This function shouldn't get an entire PeekOffsetStruct but just those
parameters it needs (direction,frame,what kind of item, etc.)
- This function should be do a visit of the frames tree, i.e. "does the current
frame have the next item? no; maybe its next (or prev, depending) sibling? no,
and it's the last sibling; ok, maybe the next sibling of its parent has it?" etc.
- nsIFrame should have a 'HasItem' or 'HasPosition' or whatever which checks
whether it or a subframe of qualifies as having a position, or a word, or an end
of a line or whatever, and returning the proper information which up until now
was returned in PeekOffsetStruct.
- The 'HasItem' function will be implemented differently for nsTextFrame,
nsFrame, nsBRFrame just like the way it happens now with PeekOffset

BTW, One notes that PeekOffset gets called from very few places:
http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/search?string=PeekOffset%28
most calls are internal to the inheritor-of-nsFrame classes, and the rest are
from the selection/movement code in nsSelection.cpp - so one would expect a
relatively regression-free transition
that PeekOffset is called</description>

      <title>Reloading in Print Preview Kills Toolbar. Need to restart firefox after.</title>
      <description>User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4

When in print preview mode, reloading the page destroys the original
window/toolbars. If you have multiple tabs open, they are added to the print
preview window.

This might have something to do with but #177491

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to anypage.
2.Print Preview
3.Right click on the Grey background to select "reload" (Though useful, possibly
a bug in itself?)
4.Notice that your original window is gone.
5.Cry becuase you lost twenty-odd windows and there's no built in way to save
open tabs.

Actual Results:  
The original window dies. The print preview window may do several odd things
depending on if you have other windows/tabs open.

Expected Results:  
It should have refreshed print preview and left everything else alone.</description>

      <description>Full update archives may need to contain remove commands.

When we remove or move some file in a distribution, we need to include a
corresponding "remove" command in the full update archive.  For partial
updates, this is already done by virtue of the fact that the partial
update is generated from the differences between two distributions.

After discussing this problem with bsmedberg and chase, we settled on
leveraging packages-static's supposed support for "-" prefixed lines that
specify files that should not be part of the distribution.  We'll need to
add a way to specify a remove list to make_full_update.sh, but that should
be pretty straightforward.</description>

      <title>opening bookmark group fails if "When opening a bookmark group" is set to "Replace existing tabs"</title>
      <description>User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8b2) Gecko/20050707 SeaMonkey/1.0a
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8b2) Gecko/20050707 SeaMonkey/1.0a

This started occuring when I updated to the version of SeaMonkey I have
(Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8b2) Gecko/20050707
SeaMonkey/1.0a; Build ID: 2005070706, but I think you should be seeing that
anyway...) from a nightly build about a month or two old (can't say exactly
because I uninstalled it before installing SeaMonkey) of the Mozilla Application
Suite.

When I try to open a bookmark group with "When opening a bookmark group" set to
"Replace existing tabs" only the first tab in that bookmark group gets opened -
and to make things even weirder - in a new tab (in the background).
This can be reproduced with any number of tabs already open.
Added confusion is provided though, if only one tab is open and "Hide tab bar
when only one tab is open" is checked:
The first tab from the bookmark group is opened, but the tab-bar stays hidden
and the tab that was selected before trying to open the bookmark group keeps the
focus.
This results in the window looking as if nothing at all had happened.
The tab has however been opened, as it can be selected by the shortcuts
(Ctrl+Tab, Ctrl+Shift+Tab, Ctrl+PgUp, Ctrl+PgDwn), it displays in the tab bar,
if another tab is opened (either by clicking the bookmark group again, or by any
other method) (along with that new tab), and when closing the navigator window I
get a warning message telling me there are 2 tabs open.
This behaviour is very similar to some of that described in Bug 107276 (at least
by my first comment there and by Bug 113589, which has been marked as a
duplicate of 107276) and my guess would be that they share a common cause.

I wouldn't be surprised if both this bug and 107276 were symptoms of the same
bug, as they started happening at the same time for me and I guess this bug
could be caused by some component trying to close the first tab (to replace it
with a tab from the bookmark group), failing and stopping the whole operation.
The first tab from the group being opened would in some way sound logical, as
the coder might have decided to do that before closing the other tabs so the tab
bar doesn't disappear and reappear quickly, in case "Hide tab bar when only one
tab is open" is on. Opening all tabs before closing the currently open ones
would have taken too long most likely.
I would really recommend having a look at Bug 113589 (even if it's a bit long)
before trying to fix this one.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
try to open a bookmark group with "When opening a bookmark group" set to
"Replace existing tabs"
Actual Results:  
only the first link from bookmark group opened

it should have opened all the links in the bookmark group</description>

      <title>visual errors with close button when a lot of tabs are opened.</title>

Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; es-ES; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4

I opened a lot of tabs from "open in tabs" option of freshmeat.net RSS bookmark.

The error are:
1) The close button is back the last visible tab (still visible thanks to
transparency of the tab)
2) The visibility of that last tab and the close button behaves wrongly when
moving the cursor around there: sometimes the close tab is above (at least it's
displayed above the tab) sometimes the tab goes to top.
3) The other tabs disappeared

I think that these problems could be fixed if the close button is always on top
of the tab pane or to be displayed the last.

I think that the final fix to all these problems could be make an scrolled tab
pane to put all the tabs.

By example:

+------------------------------------------------------------+
| Nowadays Tab pane                                          |
| +-----------------------------------------------+ +------+ |
| | Scrolled Tab pane                             | |   CB | |
| +-----------------------------------------------+ +------+ |
+------------------------------------------------------------+

CB stands for close button.

I hope this could help you :)

Regards!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a lot of tabs
2. Optionally, move the cursor around the close button

Actual Results:  
wrong display &amp; "onmouseover" behaviour of close button and last tab.

Expected Results:  
The tab pane should be scrollable or, at least, the last tab should not be
displayed in the same place of the close button.</description>

      <title>focus rectangle drawn incorrectly in some cases</title>
      <description>In Bugzilla's new attachment page, tabbing down to the requests section and
setting the review request to ? (by typing ?) and then hitting tab causes the
cursor and keyboard focus to move to the newly-enabled input box, but causes a
focus rectangle to be drawn around the next dropdown (which is where tab would
go if the input box wasn't enabled).

In a possibly related bug, clicking on a tab in Firefox now draws a focus
rectangle around that tab's title, even if the page itself has focus -- on a
page with horizontal scrolling, using the left/right arrow keys causes the page
to scroll, instead of the tabs switching (as would be expected if the tabs had
focus).</description>

This happens when I detach attachments both from messages on my IMAP server and
from messages in Local Folders. The problem doesn't exist on message that do not
have digital signatures. So far I have tried this only on messages containing a
single attachment.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open message containing digital signature
2.Right click on attachment, then select "Detach..."
3.Save attachment

Actual Results:  
Attachment is detached and saved, but the text of the message is no longer viewable.

Expected Results:  
The text of the message should have remained viewable.</description>

Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4

If you have to uninstall Firefox, the uninstall routines do not correctly
restore IE. two problems (1) After the Firefox uninstall, IE loads the following
as the Home: http://-url%20"ftp://Bedrock@ftp.willbros.com/"
The Preferences Home in the System for IE is ftp://Bedrock@ftp.willbros.com/
Also after uninstalling foxfire the emails with a URL pointer, executing the
pointer actually calls the 'open file' window instead of directly opening IE and
sending you to the pointer URL.
Sounds like both are attributable to either an altered ini file or renaming one
of IE key fetch subroutines with one that Foxfire needs. Our IT department can't
find the file altered by Firefx during install the messes up IE.
Sounds like UNinstall is missing a cleanup and restore feature. Unfortunately no
one in IE can figure out how to restore IE without doing a complete system
restore to a time before Foxfire was installed. NO GOOD. IF you know how to
restore or which file(s) to delete we would dearly like to know.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install Firefox
2.UNinstall Firefox
3.Run IE


Actual Results:  
IE loads the following as the Home: http://-url%20"ftp://Bedrock@ftp.willbros.com/"
also - IE does not open when using an email pointer to a URL instead it call a
open file window.

Expected Results:  
IE should not be altered when loading Foxfire (they should co-exist)and when
foxfire in uninstalled, IE should run normally.</description>

      <title>Need APIs to set SSL session expiration timeout</title>
      <description>Currently, the SSL session expiration timeout for server sockets is set to the
value configured by SSL_ConfigServerSessionIDCache .

For client sockets however, the timeout appears to be hardcoded to 24 hours,
with no way for applications to change it.

If an application connects to many different SSL servers, the cache will grow
without bounds until 24 hours have elapsed.

This translates to RAM growth (which customers have misinterpreted as memory
leaks) as well as unacceptable decreased performance due to the purging
algorithm which does a linear search of all client cache sessions .

One way to avoid this problem is to limit the total client cache size. This is
the subject of bug 300343 .

Another way is to allow configuring the SSL session expiration timeout to a
shorter value for individual SSL sockets. I could not find an API to do this.

A "getter" function for the per-socket timeout value would also be nice, but not
required.</description>

OS: Windows 2000 SP4  + Update Rollup 1    Language=de

When using windows.open function with a specified size the usable size of the
open window is different dependent on of showing status bar or not.

If you use placing elements related to the bottem of the window, you can expect
different results. A design developed for all browsers is therefore represented
wrongly in Firefox.

I´ve followed the discussion about the sense of giving the control of the status
bar into the hand of users. I don´t agree with this for popup windows. But if
you do this you have to realize that the usable size of the open window is equal
all the time. Compare this with other Browsers and than it´s clear.


JavaScript for open the new window:

function winopen(url,SizeX,SizeY,PosX,PosY)
{
 WinIndex =
window.open(url,"_blank","location=no,menubar=no,resizable=no,scrollbars=no,status=no,toolbar=no");
 WinIndex.blur();
 WinIndex.focus();
 WinIndex.resizeTo(SizeX,SizeY);
 WinIndex.moveTo(PosX,PosY);
 WinIndex.location=url;
 WinIndex.focus();
}

Used StyleSheet

 &lt;div class="t08n" style="position:absolute; right:20px; bottom:9px; z-index:2;"&gt;
  &lt;a href="javascript:window.close();"&gt;close window&lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the Website http://www.atelier-lange.de/index.htm
2. Klick on the photo and look to the text below the photo. Try this without
status bar than it´s well shown.


Actual Results:  
The status bar is shown in the new window and the usable size (height) is reduced.


Expected Results:  
The status bar is not shown in the new window   or   the usable size (height) is
the same like without status bar.</description>

      <description>Print preview usually (but not always) tears down the old presshell and just
creates a new one when you exit print preview.  This disables designmode by
tearing down the presshell the editor was set up for.

Perhaps we should always cache the presshell in print preview (sort of like the
way fastback works)?  We have to do it anyway for pages with plugins,
apparently, so I'd say it's better to have only one codepath...  Failing that,
we should somehow make editor deal with this (possibly with  some outside help)</description>

I want to know when Firefox is sending form data, so I set
security.warn_submit_insecure to true.  When I go to any insecure Web page
(www.yahoo.com or www.google.com for example), enter some data into the form
field, and submit the form, the Security Alert dialog box shows up.

I leave the "Alert me whenever I submit information that's not encrypted"
checked on, and click Continue.  This results in the exact same dialog box
appearing again.  Leaving the checkbox on and clicking Continue again, the form
is finally submitted.

If I uncheck either the first or second check boxes, I never get the alert
dialog for any form submission.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Modify user.js or use the Preferential Extension and modify
   security.warn_submit_insecure to true.
2. Go to any Web page with a text form submission.
3. Type in some text and submit the form.

Actual Results:  
Two identical alert dialog boxes.

Expected Results:  
I would expect only one dialog box.  The first one is reasonable since it's
alerting me of a potential security risk.  But after acknowledging it, the
second one shouldn't show up.

since the columns aren't there, it's just text. Also, the filename curiously

This is similar to #282910. The firefox-0.8 and before doesn't have this
problem. I am not sure if firefox-0.9 has this problem. But 1.0 and 1.04 as well
as the newest build have this problem.

I use a perl script to send file of different types, such as application/pdf,
video/quicktime, image/jpg etc. The image files are hadled correctly by the
browser, i.e. they are displayed in the window. But for pdf files, the download
window shows up (as it should be), but the file type is shown as PL. Since the
firefox-0.8 handles it correctly, I am quite sure the server have sent the
correct Content-Type. To make it absolutely sure, I used a perl script (instead
of browser) to request the same URL and got the following header fields:
200
Connection: close
Date: Sat, 09 Jul 2005 05:20:25 GMT
Server: Apache/1.3.26 (Unix) mod_perl/1.27

try adding "charity/charityhome.htm" to the URL - oddly menus now function, but
text is offset; this may well be a frameset problem, but not being able to
follow the intended way to reach the page, it's hard to tell.

As a matter of interest, in Deerpark, when tracking back to the home URL for

When using an HTML &lt;select&gt; that contains a list of inpage bookmarks and an
onchange event handler for that select element, the page will flicker as the
page location is changed to the bookmark's location in the page but then snapped
back to the location where the original &lt;select&gt; is located and orienting the
page so that said &lt;select&gt; is at the very top of the window.

This appears to be because after focus never fully leaves the &lt;select&gt; control

Expression of a percentage is different in Turkish than in English. English
follows, say, "56 percent" for 56%. However, it's as "yüzde 56" and shown as 56%
percent in Turkish.

Make it available to chance the order of number and percentage sign (%).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Try to save or download a file by a Mozilla product.
2. Look at percentage.
3. See #%.
Actual Results:  
I see #% order.

      <title>Javaprxy exploit hangs firefox and operating system</title>
      <description>User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; it-IT; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050524 Fedora/1.0.4-4 Firefox/1.0.4
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; it-IT; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050524 Fedora/1.0.4-4 Firefox/1.0.4

Opening a proper html page generated from javaprxy exploit code (see
FrSIRT/ADV-2005-0935 - IE related exploit), Firefox starts eating cpu cycles and
ram memory taking the system to be heavily unusable. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to: http://www.frsirt.com/exploits/20050702.iejavaprxyexploit.pl.php
2. Download the perl file and run it to generate a proper html file which
contains the exploit
3. Open it with Firefox

Actual Results:  
Firefox was not responsive anymore and operating system wasn't too.

Expected Results:  
I expected a page reporting this statement :

Microsoft Internet Explorer javaprxy.dll COM Object Remote Exploit by the FrSIRT
&lt; http://www.frsirt.com &gt; Solution
http://www.frsirt.com/english/advisories/2005/0935

I had to open a shell to kill the process to restore, but I could not prove if
the exploit opened a port on my system. Neither I could understand if this issue
strictly depends on Firefox or Java or Linux itself. So I really don't know if
this is a security issue or not. I'm just reporting, sure that someone here will
clarify what I've just experienced.
Many thanks for your great work !</description>

Everytime I visit this page, I get this error. I did not particularly care to
install quick time, but I finally broke down and did it. First, Firefox can not
do the automatic install. Second, after a manual install, I still get the message.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Just visit http://members.cox.net/discenzafarms/. There are flash elements on
the page which must be triggering this error condition.
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
You will get the following error message: "Additional plugins are required to
display all of the media on this page".

Expected Results:  
First, I would like the option of not having to install plugins that Firefox
thinks I need. I should be able to acknowledge it and turn it off if I chose.
Secondly, the automatic install should work if I chose to try it (at least for
the most popular plugins like quicktime, flash, acrobat ..... Finally, if for
any reason the install does not fix the problem, the user should also have the
ability to turn off the warning messages for specific (NOT ALL) error
conditions.  Thanks, -Rick.

What's up with losing my bookmarks once a month?? This is a major problem, one

      <title>Accidental middle-click on bookmarks toolbar replaces tabs</title>
      <description>User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; nl; rv:1.8b2) Gecko/20050706 Firefox/1.0+
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; nl; rv:1.8b2) Gecko/20050706 Firefox/1.0+

Currently, middle-clicking on an item in the bookmarks toolbar will open all its
contents in separate tabs. While doing this, it replaces the contents of all
current tabs, and closes tabs it does not need. I do not think this behavior is
desirable, for the following reason:

There have so far already been multiple occasions where I have, with the
intention of middle-clicking on a tab to close it, accidentally middle-clicked
on the bookmark folder above it, causing all my tabs to be replaced with the
contents of the bookmark.

For the tabs that remain afterwards, I can revert them to their original
location by going through them one by one and going back 1 position in the
history, but for the tabs that I had in excess to the number of bookmarks in the
folder, they are lost.

I do believe this should not be possible, everytime this happens it gives me a
lot of frustration, and this issue falls into the same category as to why there
are no ‘close buttons’ on the tabs.

Middle-clicking on top-level folders in the bookmarks toolbar should either:
1. Do nothing;
2. Open in *NEW* tabs instead of replacing the current ones;
3. Not close tabs in excess.

Personally, I never use the "middle-click to open multiple tabs" feature, so as
far as I am concerned, solution 1 is the most desirable. Given however that
there will probably be complaints for the loss of functionality solution 2 would
also be good. Solution 3 is sub-optimal, but better than nothing.

So, after downloading with this setting enabled, Mozilla did not downloaded
messages larger than 1 MB, then I tried to disable it (unchecking the checkbox
"Messages larger than [1024] KB" in preference window) and downloaded again
(because I had messages with 3 MB in my POP3 account). Mozilla did not download
the remaining messages (larger than 1 MB). Mozilla only downloads if I change
the value to 5 MB.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enable "Disk Space" setting in Edit ---&gt; Mail &amp; Newsgroup Account Settings
---&gt;  (choose a POP3 Account) ---&gt; Disk Space ---&gt; [x] Messages larger than
[1024] KB.
2. Download all messages. Be sure you have some messages larger than 1 MB in
your POP3 account.
3. After download all small messages, go back to account setting and disable
"Disk Space", unchecking the checkbox "Messages larger than [1024] KB".
4. Try to download again. Mozilla will not download the messages (larger than 1
MB) remaining in your mailbox.
5. Go back to account settings and change the value (1024 KB = 1 MB) to (5120 KB
= 5 MB).
6. Try to download again. Now Mozilla will download all messages larger than 1 MB.
Actual Results:  
Mozilla behaved as described.

Expected Results:  
Download all messages, ignoring the old setting.</description>

      <title>Firefox Crashes, QFA does not send incidents, error of Proxy Server Settings "The Agent is unable to connect to the Server"</title>
      <description>User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4

I am having the same problem, Firefox crashes, QFA creates error log, but there
is no Incident ID # showing, I have at least 4 crash results that are in queue.
The QFA does not send them, although it does try,  I then get the following
error "The Agent is unable to connect to the Server.  Please check your proxy
settings or try again in a few seconds."  Firefox is crashing all the time,
never happened before, just in the past week. I have lost my entire profile.  I
am running AVG anti-virus and Zone Alarm, if that means anything.  I have DSL.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. It just happens, I do not know why
2.

      <title>Should set focus to found link in Normal Find(Ctrl + F)</title>
      <description>In FAYT's text find mode("/") and Normal Find(Ctrl + F), should we set focus to
found link? Currently, we set focus to found link only in FAYT's link find
mode("'").

By bug 259454 is fixed, we get new behavior, that is pseudo-focus.
We can set pseudo-focus to found link, even if the "real" focus is set to find
toolbar. So now, we can set focus to found link in *all find mode*.</description>

      <title>Set loadFolderAndReplace default to "false"</title>
      <description>User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; nl; rv:1.8b2) Gecko/20050706 Firefox/1.0+
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; nl; rv:1.8b2) Gecko/20050706 Firefox/1.0+

As described in bug 216346, there is a preference
"browser.tabs.loadFolderAndReplace" which controls whether a middle-click on a
bookmark folder will replace the current tabs, or create new tabs.

The resolution of that bug was INVALID, with the rationale "there is a pref
available, so the bug as it stands is invalid". I do not agree that resolution
is in the spirit of the original issue, but alas. I have filed this bug to
address not the ability, but the default behavior of Firefox.

Due to the destructive nature of the default behavior, the high number of
duplicates in the aforementioned bug, and the other rationale (in particular in
my comment no. 33 [1]), I believe that the default for this preference should be
set to ‘false’, causing bookmark folders to open in new tabs instead.

This will impact few users negatively, and many positively, in particular your
average grandfather, but also regular users like me who have good motoristic
mouse control skills but still run into this issue multiple times. For the
people who depend on the current behavior, I do not think the new behavior would
be particularly bothersome, and if they feel it is, they can be considered
‘power users’ and be told to change this preference accordingly.

      <title>Click on header doesn't mark mail as "read" if sender has receipt requested.</title>
      <description>User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4
Build Identifier: Thunderbird version 1.0.2 (20050317)

In reading email, if sender has requested a receipt, clicking on header to open
mail launches dialog to approve the receipt to be sent.  Closing the "approval"
dialog allows the mail to be read.  However, the mail is NOT marked as "read"
and stays in bold type in header pane.  If you click it again and open, then it
does become marked as read like normal.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have mail sent that requires receipt
2. Click on mail in header pane
3. Dialog is open to approve sending of receipt

Actual Results:  
The mail is opened after the dialog to approve the sending of the receipt.  But,
the mail remains marked as NOT read.

Expected Results:  
Mark message as read.</description>
