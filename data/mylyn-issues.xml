      <title>Rename {Eclipse Project, DTP, WTP} Incubator project to ...Labs</title>
      <description>The projects Eclipse Project Incubator, DTP Incubator, and WTP Incubator all contain a couple of experimental subprojects. Outside from Eclipse these kinds of project are called "Labs":
- Google Labs: http://www.googlelabs.com/
- Mozilla Labs: http://mozillalabs.com/
- Apache Labs: http://labs.apache.org/
Especially for Non-Eclipse experts it would be great if Eclipse also applied this naming convention.
Furthermore, "Incubator" could be easily mistaken for "Incubation" which is however not a place but a project phase.</description>

      <title>Event racing while initializing compare editor - garbled connecting lines</title>
      <description>Sometimes the compare editor for Java Elements (compare with other
element) starts with correct regions but wrong connecting lines.
(cf. bug 297316 comment 5 for the original observation).

Inspecting this in the debugger revealed the following
non-deterministic behaviour:

When running without breakpoints the problem can be reproduced.
When setting a few breakpoints the behaviour was correct.
The breakpoint that seemed to make the difference was actually
a watch point (Modification) on StyledText.verticalScrollOffset.
This leads me to the conclusion that some widgets may get painted
before the vertical scroll offset is correctly initialized.

More specifically, I could observe:
Method TextMergeViewer.handleResizeLeftRight(..) triggers method
StyledText.scrollVertical(int,boolean) thus initializing the
vertical scroll offset. However, before the method updates field
StyledText.verticalScrollOffset, a call to scroll(..) may trigger
update() which calls into the UI mainloop (gdk_window_process_updates()).
Depending on event ordering (I assume -- this happens in native code)
this may call back into doPaint() which invokes paintCenter() and
paintSides() in an inconsistent state, since the verticalScrollOffset
is used before assigned.</description>

      <title>[EDP] PMC makeup description is wrong, or at least not right.</title>
      <description>In the Development Process document, in 
http://www.eclipse.org/projects/dev_process/development_process.php#4_6_Leaders
It says
&lt;quote&gt;
Top-Level Projects are managed by a Project Management Committee (PMC). Sub-Projects are managed by one or more Project Leaders. The PMC Lead(s) of a Top-Level Project are the Project Leader(s) of that project.
&lt;/quote&gt;

But this isn't right. Project leads are not automatically PMC members, and PMC members do not _have_ to lead a Project. We've never done it in WTP that way, similar for "Tools" TLP. But, I know that does sound like the "Modeling" model. 

You could fix by just leaving off the very last sentence, or, if needed, you could say something like "After the initial formation, the PMC members choose who they want to be on the PMC by their own criteria and decision process, which varies from TLP to TLP". Or, something like that.</description>

      <title>[EMF Compare] Difference marked as local - should be remote</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: 20090920-1017

I have a non-EMF object included in the EMF model.  On the remote copy, it is set to null (it has a value in the local and ancestor copy).

The difference engine identifies the change, but marks it incorrectly as a local change.  It should have been marked as remote.

      <title>[EDP] Project Leadership selection process is wrong, or confusing</title>
      <description>This is similar or related to bug 300002. In 
http://www.eclipse.org/projects/dev_process/development_process.php#4_6_Leaders
it says 
&lt;quote&gt;
Subsequently, additional Project Leadership (PMC members or Sub-Project Leaders) must be elected by the Project's Committers1 and the Board or EMO(ED) (for PMC members and Sub-Project Leads respectively). 
&lt;/quote&gt;
First, it's just plain confusing, in that it packs too much into one sentence. I can't unpack it. 

Second, the actual process seems to leave sub-project leadership entirely up to the committers on that sub-project. Fine by me, but don't think that's the way it works in practice. 
  
This sentence came to my attention when I was "elected" to be Orbit Project lead. I was "chosen" by the PMC, not the committers. And then a committer mailing list discussion followed about "how is the lead supposed to be chosen? ... did anyone else want to "run" for the job". [no one did, unfortunately ... ha ha, ha]. 

I think, for sub-project leads, it should be worded something like 
- - -
Subsequently, additional Sub-Project Leadership can be chosen by the PMC, and confirmed by a vote of the committers of the project, or chosen by the committers and confirmed by a vote of the PMC. 
- - - 
Or, something like that. 
This does change the substance a little, in that it acknowledges a role for both the PMC and the committers. The previous wording sounded like to could be up to the committers entirely. Its unlikely one would ever not confirm the others choice ... but, seems only right to let (or, insist?) the Project Management Committee do some management. :) 

You could sort out the PMC/Board/EMO(ED) clauses in separate sentences in similar ways.</description>

I attempted to import the p2.releng project set. I had some of the projects already in my workspace, but was missing others.

      <title>[EMF Compare] Priority in match engine schema marked as deprecated, but it is not.</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: 20090920-1017

The priority field for EMF Compare match engines added via the extension point is marked as deprecated.  However, it is still being used to determine between engines that match on the same extensions and there is not another way to make this distinction.

The removal of priority would result in arbitrary use of two competing match engines.  This will happen when one creates a new match engine for "*", since the default is always available.

      <title>[project explorer] New projects are not immediately visible in Explorer</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: 20090920-1017

Description looks like https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=239155 but I believe this is separate issue.

We have our product based on JSDT. Our Explorer did not always show newly created projects. I haven't seen this problem with WTP projects in "clean" WTP install.

Basically, the problem seems to be that the root of the explorer view is IWorkspaceRoot, not IWorkspace. org.eclipse.wst.jsdt.internal.ui.navigator.JavaNavigatorContentProvider#314 should add getRoot() when modifying the parent to pass to super.

In our code we had to do:
		if (parent instanceof IJavaScriptModel)
			super.postAdd(((IJavaScriptModel) parent).getWorkspace(), element, runnables);
		else if (parent instanceof IJavaScriptProject) 
			super.postAdd( ((IJavaScriptProject)parent).getProject(), element, runnables);
		else
			super.postAdd(parent, element, runnables);

      <title>tweek for templated jaxws build</title>
      <description>I recently broke the jaxws build, by updating the wtp pre-req to WTP M4. 

First, there was a typp in the M4 URL so the whole zip could not be found. Easy to fix that. 

But, then ran into the problem where WTP itself already contains a build of JAXWS, so it is not re-build by PDE, but instead just attempted to be packaged up as already built. Thus, we need to delete the jaxws related features and bundles after installing/unzipping WTP itself. 

I used to do that "by hand" on a case by case basis, to the zip stored in pre-req cache. This time, I solved by editing the customTargets.xml file, so that right after "get and install dependencies" I call delete task, with jaxws patterns. Namely, 

       &lt;delete&gt;
        &lt;fileset dir="${buildRoot}"&gt;
         &lt;include name="**/org.eclipse.jst.ws.cxf*/**,**/org.eclipse.jst.ws.jaxws*/**,**/org.eclipse.jst.ws.jaxb*/**" /&gt; 
        &lt;/fileset&gt;
     &lt;/delete&gt;

It works for this case, but could get overly complex for other cases. 

Seems a good tactical solution until we move to P2 based prereqs/installs. 

One problem, though, is if/when I regenerate the customTargets.xml file from the templates, my hand modifications will be lost. Which is why I wanted to document it in this bug. :)</description>

      <title>[DB] Develop a delta-mapping</title>
      <description>This idea has been floating around in Eike's an my heads for a while.
A mapping should be developed which combines the performance of the non-audit store with an auditing capability. 

The result could be a delta-mapping for the DBStore which uses the existing non-audit mapping implementations and augments it with a mechanism to store reverse revision-deltas in separate tables. The behavior would be similar to RCS/CVS: the most current version (HEAD) would be stored as is (hence the reuse of non-audit mappings) and if a new revision is committed, the backwards delta is calculated and stored. 

This trades off auditing performance for speed when working with the current version: When accessing an old revision, it has to be reconstructed by fetching the HEAD revision and applying the backwards deltas until the desired version is reached.</description>

      <title>[language support] object member types partly not inferred</title>
      <description>There seems to be a problem with the type inference 
(used for content assistance)
in conjunction with object members assigned to variables 
(or other object members).

The content assistance works fine for all examples given in
the snippet below, except for the expression
"this.s.a" in function "foo2".

The inference engine seems to e able to "follow"
assignments (via ":" in object lieterals) of "simple"
variables to object members. (See the use of "t" in "foo3".)

However it does not seem to be able to "follow"
assignments of members of objects to object members
as shown in "foo2". 
In this case "x.x1" is assigned to "s". The type of "s"
seems to be unknown. Consequently the jsdt content assist does not
make any suggestions. 


var x = {
    x1 : {
        a : "a",
        b : "b"
    }
};

x.x1; // okay

var y = x;

y.x1;   // okay
y.x1.a; // okay
y.x1.b; // okay

var z = x.x1;
z.a;          // okay
z.b;          // okay

var l = {
    r : x,
    foo1 : function() {
        this.r.x1; // okay
    },
    s : x.x1, // okay

    foo2 : function() {
        /**
         * does not work
         * i.e. typing "this.s. Control-Space" does
         * not make any proposals
         */
        this.s.a;
    },

    t : {
        u : {
            m : 3
        }
    },
    foo3 : function() {
        this.t;      // okay
        this.t.u;    // okay
        this.t.u.m;  // okay
    }
};

This behaviour has been observed with the version below:

Like this:
class Test{
public:
  void testMethod()
  {
    myField=1;
  }
protected:
  int myField;
};

Eclipse highlight this as valid code, 'go to definition' works ok, but
code assistant fails to propose names of this fields in methods
prior to definition of this fields. 
In example above 'myField' won't be proposed in a testMethod.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Paste following snippet:
class Test{
public:
  void testMethod()
  {
  }
protected:
  int myField;
};
2. Place cursor inside testMethod.
3. Type my and  invoke any completion except for 'word completion'. 'myField' is not proposed.</description>

      <description>Build Identifier: Build id: I20091030-1201

I have created a file using GEF Flow example,
When opened using Flow Example editor you can see that the a particular sub graph (parallel flow is not visible fully),

I can implemented a flow chart using the same graphlayoutmanager principle in that this type of error occurs frequently.

I will attach both files so that you can view them.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Take GEF Flow example plugin.
2.Run it as an eclipse application.
3.Open the attached layouterror.flow in GEF FLOW editor.
4.At the end of the diagram you can see a particular subgraph(parallel flow not visible fully)</description>

      <title>[content assist] content/selection wrong when CodeCompletion adds new Imports</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: M20090917-0800

When I select a new type in the contentassist when write a new code in a java method, the code behind is overwritten. This seems to be an issue with the automatic insertion of missing imports.

Sometimes I have to close the java editor becauseof invisible characters at the end of the line. It seems like there is something wrong with synchronization between the document and the content of the styledtext-widget.

Today I got the following error after adding code via contentassist:

      <title>Link with Editor points to different project when file from the library is opened</title>
      <description>1. Create few projects in the workspace.
2. In the editor ctrl+click on a predefined function (for example define).

The relevant file from the PHP library opens (for example basic.php).

If "Link with Editor" in PHP Explorer is selected it usually points to e different project. That means: if the file containing the 'define' is in one project, the "Link with Editor" points to the basic.php under the PHP Library under another project.
The PHP Library is common to all the projects in the workspace, so the problem is that 'link with editor' shows another project after opening the file.

      <title>The deprecation warning for a type should not include the package name</title>
      <description>I20100112-0800.

The deprecation warning for a type should not include the package name.

Test Case:
1. paste the following snippet into the Package Explorer.

package a.b.c.d;

/** @deprecated */
public class Deprecated {

}
package a.b.c.d;

public class T {

	a.b.c.d.Deprecated f;
	
}

==&gt; the deprecation warning covers "a.b.c.d.Deprecated" but should only cover the type name ("Deprecated") since the package itself is not deprecated. This is similar to deprecated methods where we also only mark the method as deprecated.

      <title>[Combo] Causes warning messages in qooxdoo console</title>
      <description>When using a ComboViewer the default way:

this.roleCombo = new ComboViewer(parent, SWT.READ_ONLY);
this.roleCombo.setContentProvider(new ActorRoleContentProvider());
this.roleCombo.setLabelProvider(new ActorRoleLabelProvider());
this.roleCombo.setInput(""); //$NON-NLS-1$
this.roleCombo.setSelection(new StructuredSelection(ActorRole.COORDINATOR));
this.roleCombo.getCombo().setLayoutData(ViewGuiFactory.getComboGridData());

I get this error message in the qooxdoo console everytime when making changing  the selection of the combo:

006595 WARN:  qx.ui.form.ListItem[1258]: The function scrollIntoViewY can only be called after the widget is created!

The ComboViewer works as expected.
I have reproduced this with a couple of other ComboViewers in the application so it doesn't seem to be a side-effect of a particular view.
This happens in FireFox 3.5 and Explorer 7.</description>

      <title>Undefined stereotypes appear in the explorer and diagrams</title>
      <description>To reproduce :

a) Ensure the explorere preferences are set to display Stereotypes.

b) Create profile "A" and add some stereotypes.

c) Deploy it

d) Add stereotypes to artifacts (that are alos in diagrams).

e) Create profile "B" with no stereotypes.

f) Deploy it

Now:

In the editor, the Stereotype is shown greyed out and tagged as "Undefined"

BUT

In the explorer the stereotype is still shown,

and the diagranm still shows the undefined stereotypes.</description>

      <title>[DataBinding] Need better support for binding collections of complex types</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: M20090917-0800

The way to observe properties (e.g. to refresh cell labels in a TableViewer) of a regular property (a distinct element) is trivial, but doing the same for a collection of complex types is awkward, and requires the application developer to write a significant amount of code using "obscure" classes. 

This is one way to observe properties of a distinct instance:
IObservableMap father = BeansObservables.observeMap(elements, "father.name");

I would like to observe children more or less the same way:
IObservableMap children = BeansObservables.observeMap(elements, "children.name");

'children' would fire events whenever a child was added or removed, or whenever the name of a child was modified. 
(will attempt to attach a screenshot to illustrate)

For bonus points :-)
In both cases, it would also be nice if I could specify a collection of properties to observe, and have the method return an aggregated map of some sort. This would allow me to compile all necessary observables in one single map. Although the typical use of the returned map might be to pass it as an argument to a label provider (which typcally accepts arrays of maps, e.g. 'org.eclipse.jface.databinding.viewers.ObservableMapLabelProvider.ObservableMapLabelProvider(IObservableMap[])'), returning a single, composite map would make it easier to use in contexts where an array is not accepted. One example could be to return a map from a factory passed to 'org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable.map.CompositeMap.CompositeMap(IObservableMap, IObservableFactory)'.

Hence, I would also like to have the following methods:

IObservableMap father = BeansObservables.observeMap(elements, "father.firstName", "father.lastName");
IObservableMap children = BeansObservables.observeMap(elements, "children.firstName", "children.lastName");

An extended version of the snippet org.eclipse.jface.examples.databinding.snippets.Snippet025TableViewerWithPropertyDerivedColumns could be used to illustrate the problem and the solution. Right now, it only holds columns with distinct entities. Adding a column with "children" would illustrate the issue.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open snippet org.eclipse.jface.examples.databinding.snippets.Snippet025TableViewerWithPropertyDerivedColumns 
2. Add the property "Person.children" and let it return a Set or a List
3. Add a column to represent the new property, and have it updated whenever the collection of children changes, or any of the children has its name changed.
4. For the "bonus point issue": modify Person to have "name" derived from "firstName" and "lastName", and have all columns updated when either changes.</description>

      <title>[General] Move extra plugins in more appropriate directory</title>
      <description>Some plugins are not directly part of the Papyrus distribution. They can be moved in another hierarchy.
This will ease the creation of a main feature (Papyrus), and additional features linked to the extra plugins.
Example of plugins:
- java reverse
- modisco adapter
- example.*
- umltools adapters
- ...
I propose to create a new dir called 'extraplugins' at the same level as the 'plugins' dir.
In this 'extraplugins' dir, we will have one dir for each possible extra feature.

Example of the proposal:
  --trunk 
       +--- plugins
       +--- extraplugins
                  +--- reverse
                            +--- org.eclipse.papyrus.java.reverse

When working with a source control repos - such as ClearCase - only non-derived files are supposed to be checked in to source repos. 

We have derived files that we would like to set encoding setting for deployment - via the IResource.setEncoding() call - but such API call saves the derived file's encoding setting in the .settings\org.eclipse.core.resources.prefs file - which also contains encoding setting for non-derived files..

This is causing a problem that we are persisting encoding settings for non-files that are not in source repos...

We find there is no other API call/option that can save the derived file's encoding setting in a different place.

      <title>[Widgets] bold text in dynamic help tooltip overlaps and is not readable</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: 20090920-1017

When hovering over elements of code, a dynamic help tooltip box pops up.  The bold text at the top of the box will overlap so that it's not readable.  It's as if every space in a block of bold text moves the cursor left about 5 spaces.  I think the problem coincided with the installation of Snow Leopard, but I'm not sure.

      <title>[pull up] Pull up refactoring broken for pulling method from concrete class to interface</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: M20090211-1700

Found in both these versions:
Galileo - build id 20090621-0832
Ganymede - build id M20090211-1700 (3.4.2)

It appears that "Pull up..." does not work properly when attempting to pull up the interface of a method from a concrete class into an interface.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create one class and one interface, as below.
2. Select "method" in Concrete class and choose "Pull up..." refactoring
3. Complete the refactoring.

Code:
import javax.swing.JFrame;

public class Concrete implements Interface
{
    private JFrame frame;

    public void method()
    {
        frame = new JFrame();
    }
}
----
public interface Interface
{

}

Result:

* Get warning: "The visibility of field 'Concrete.frame' will be changed to default."
* Import added to interface
* Visibility of private field changed to default
* Contents of code below:

----
import javax.swing.JFrame;

public interface Interface
{

    public void method();

}
----
package dest;

import javax.swing.JFrame;

public class Concrete implements Interface
{
    JFrame frame;

    public void method()
    {
        frame = new JFrame();
    }
}

Expected:
* No warnings
* No changes to Concrete class
* Interface should be as below:

----
public interface Interface
{

    public void method();

      <title>Xdebug: The breakpoints work but the results appear in web browser only at the end</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: 20090920-1017

My config:

1)I use wamp 5.3.0

2)I have configured eclipse with that step by step procedure: http://www.techiedesi.com/post/229-setup-xdebug-and-php5-with-eclipse-34-to-debug-your-php-website-at-runtime

3)In phpinfo:
Zend Engine v2.3.0
with with Xdebug v2.0.5

-------------------------------

The page I want to debug (test)

&lt;?php

echo "1";
echo "2";
echo "3";

?&gt;

---------------------------------

Steps using option "Debug as a php script":


1-I added 3 breakpoints in the page that I wanted to debug. (one for each echo)
2-If a debug as a php script it works well. I mean it stops at each breakpoints.
     --It stops at first breakpoint
     --I click on resume and now I can see "1" in the debug output screen and in the browser output screen
     --It stops at the second breakpoint
     --I click on resume and now I can see "12" in the debug output screen and in the browser output screen
     --...

Steps using option "Debug as a php web page":

1-I repeated the same steps but now I use option "Debug as a web page"
2-a web browser automaticly opened (firefox in my case)
3-The page is an empty blank page (normal)
4-I can see that firefox is waiting for localhost...
5-Eclipse seems to stop at the breakpoint (the green line is on the first breakpoint in code)
6-I click on resume and now instead to see "1" in firefox the page is still empty (firefox still waiting for localhost)
7-I click on resume again and now instead to see "12" in firefox the page is still empty (firefox still waiting for localhost)
8-So I click on resume until the end and Now in firefox I see the output "123" at this url: http://localhost//test/test.php?XDEBUG_SESSION_START=ECLIPSE_DBGP&amp;KEY=12639192512961
9-I click on terminate in eclipse and I new tab is open in firefox with that message: DEBUG SESSION ENDED

Notes: 
-same problem with IE
-I tried on another machine using wamp 5.2.8 and another xdebug version but I have the same problem

      <title>Delete tag on CVS</title>
      <description>Hi there,

I already asked this question on the Eclipse Community Forums [1], but didn't receive an answer so far. I'm not sure, whether I am here in the right place, as this is more a question than a bug, but I'm posting it anyway. Feel free to direct me to the right place and close this bug. Thanks for reading in advance!

Our project created quite a lot of tags over a period of time. Now, it is quite complicated to find the tags that are useful. Therefore, as project co-lead I would like to clear the list of tags for the specific components, but I did not find out how.
I have access to the dev server of Eclipse via SSH and can navigate to the CVSROOT.
However, when trying to remove the tag called BRANCH_METAMODELEXT_20080710 with the following command:

cvs -d dev.eclipse.org:/cvsroot/technology rtag -d BRANCH_METAMODELEXT_20080710 /cvsroot/technology/org.eclipse.jwt/we/jwt-we


I receive the reply as follows:

The authenticity of host 'dev.eclipse.org (127.0.0.1)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is [...].
Please type 'yes' or 'no': no
Host key verification failed.

If I answer "yes" instead, I receive the following warning which I was not sure would be right or not which was the reason why I skipped this process.

Warning: Permanently added 'dev.eclipse.org' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
Password: cvs [rtag aborted]: received interrupt signal

Am I trying it the wrong way or is there anything else I need to consider?

Thanks for your hint and best regards,

Florian

      <title>ProjectComponent should avoid a workspace look-up to find build.properties</title>
      <description>Created attachment 156530 [details]
proposed fix

I20100115-1100

Currently in our ProjectComponent, when calculating the locations to create classfile containers from we add jar entries from the custom location in build.properties. We do this by looking up the build.properties file in the workspace and using a bunch of internal PDE code to retrieve the entries. 

With the changes made to leverage the PDE model for the workspace we have the handle to the IPluginModelBase representing the bundle. We should be using a call to IPluginModelBase.getBuildModel().getBuild(), instead of the search / internal code way we do it now.</description>

      <title>JIRA workflow transitions not supported</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: 3.3.1.v20091215-0000-e3x

I'm not sure if this is a connector bug or a limitation in the JIRA API, but currently I cannot use the JIRA connector for Eclipse because it does not support JIRA workflow transitions.

For example, when changing the "Status" of an issue from "open" to "review" we defined that the field "Assignee" should be modified during transition, for obvious reasons of quality assurance.

This is what happens, when I'm changing an issue in Eclipse: The "Assignee" gets changed and after that the "Status" change fails with an error, stating that the "Assignee" must be modified when changing the "Status". I'm not fully into the API, but I believe, that JIRA requires the changes to be wrapped into one single transaction to succeed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. create a JIRA workflow transition condition (e.g. Assignee should be changed)
2. open JIRA issue in Eclipse
3. change issue status including necessary transition change (e.g. change Assignee)</description>

The UML comment can be used sometimes for this purpose but it can not address situations when the model element is not UML (diagram or author for instance).
So we need to provide a view contextual to the selected element and the data should be stored in a consistent way for any situation : i.e. in an eAnnotation.</description>

It is possible to work around this by creating an aggregating feature that includes other features but that has limitations, e.g. when aggregated features need to be updatable separately.

Within the ecore Person model the attributes emails and phones are both of type String with * multiplicity. Neither of these attributes are editable when the annotation has been applied to a IResource.

From the look of the code it seems this has not been implemented yet as the class org.eclipse.tigerstripe.annotation.ui.core.properties.StringListProperty contains the following:

I am trying to use EGit in conjunction with standard Git, on the same repositories. Standard Git is used to do the merge and to run git-svn. This works fairly well except when the standard Git needs to update index. In this case, there is always a failure if Eclipse is opened and EGit has been used. I suspect, the index is locked in some way by EGit. Closing Eclipse allows to fix the problem.

      <title>[efs] FileSystemResourceManager makes second call to efs provider on exception due to cancel</title>
      <description>There is an EFS provider that connects remotely and prompts a user for a password on connect.  When a user attempts to open a project that uses this EFS provider, the following code in FileSystemResourceManager.read() gets invoked:

...
try {
--&gt;	in = new BufferedInputStream(descriptionStore.openInputStream(EFS.NONE, null));
	description = new ProjectDescriptionReader(target).read(new InputSource(in));
} catch (CoreException e) {
	//try the legacy location in the meta area
	description = getWorkspace().getMetaArea().readOldDescription(target);
	if (description != null)
		return description;
--&gt;	if (!descriptionStore.fetchInfo().exists()) {
		String msg = NLS.bind(Messages.resources_missingProjectMeta, target.getName());
		throw new ResourceException(IResourceStatus.FAILED_READ_METADATA, target.getFullPath(), msg, null);
...

The openInputStream() call causes a connect call from the EFS provider that prompts for a password.  If the user clicks cancel on the password prompt, the EFS provider throws an exception indicating that the operation is cancelled.  FileSystemResourceManager.read() catches the exception and then ends up calling descriptionStore.fetchInfo().  But that is another call to the same EFS provider, and since and EFS provider is stateless, it ends up having to prompt for the password again even though the user already cancelled the operation earlier.

I'm not sure how to resolve this problem but perhaps a check of the exception can be used to determine whether to query the descriptionStore or not.</description>

      <description>Build Identifier: 0.6.0.201001162204

I have on Git repository mirroring a SVN repository (clone was created with git-svn). This repository contains a tracked symlink. Git has no problem with it: on Windows it is converted as a file with the target as the file contents and there is no change detected by git status. With EGit, at every commit, the symlink is considered as having been changed, if forgetting to uncheck the box in the commit dialog, the symlink is modified as a real file (which is committed back to SVN as a plain file instead of a symlink by git-svn dcommit).

Cheers,

Michel

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Track a symlink (commit it) with standard git command
2.Open EGit commit dialog

      <title>JPA 2.0 schemas are missing in XML Catalog</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: org.eclipse.jst.standard.schemas_1.0.300.v200907180416

Both persistence_2_0.xsd and orm_2_0.xsd are missing from XML Catalog.
 
Currently, the two XSDs are referred to org.eclipse.jpt.core_2.3.0.v200912070000/schema where the files didn't exist.

I think the 2 XSDs should be in org.eclipse.jst.standard.schemas plugin where the persistence_1_0.xsd and orm_1_0.xsd are located.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Select "Window" -&gt; "Preferences"
2. Select "XML" -&gt; "XML Catalog"
3. From the "XML Catalog Entries" windows, scroll down to:

http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/persistence/persistence_2_0.xsd

The entry shows the the XSD is missing. Same problem apply on orm_2_0.xsd.</description>

      <title>Annotations: need support for attributes of type Enumeration with * multiplicity</title>
      <description>I need support for annotation attributes which are of type Enumeration and multiplicity *. If I create such an attribute currently then it is not editable within the properties view. To recreate this issue change the multiplicity of the sex attribute of the Person class within the ecore model of the following project in the Eclipse Tigerstripe CVS:

org.eclipse.tigerstripe/plugins/org.eclipse.tigerstripe.annotation.example.person

Regenerated the genmodel and then generate the model code and include the plugin within a runtime eclipse instance.

You will find the attribute in uneditable.

The desired behaviour is as for attributes of primitive type with * multiplicity, i.e. property view displays comma separated list of enum literals, and the list is abbreviated and "..." added if the list is long. A button, at the end of the property view line, to edit the list (as for MultiLine Strings) that opens a dialg that presents a table of currently entered values with buttons for Add/Remove.</description>

I use the above actions quite frequently (especially 'Add Watch Expression').  When reading over code in editor, users want to see the value of an expression right away and this action makes it really convenient for them to do that.

      <title>How developers are expected to discover injected values?</title>
      <description>How about a fairy tale (or a "green thread" :-)) describing the life of a new E4 developer:

===
Say I am a developer who just picked up E4 to make my new RCP text editor. I've scanned a whitepaper that explained that E4 uses model, and, in particluar the MEditor interface to represent an editor. 

That sounds cool so I make my MEditor class, and... hmm... I guess I need to create some SWT controls to show up the contents? StyledText? OK, that needs parent composite... Hmm... Where do I get the parent composite? And... hmm... where do I place the code that actually creates the conrol?
===

At this point the story supposed to somehow jump to adding lines like this:

	@Inject
	private Composite parent;

to the editor's class for the parent composite and add

	@PostConstruct
	void init() {...}

to hold the code to create the control.

===
Question is: how would the developer know about this? 

(The example is intentionally oversimplified. Those two values probably can be considered "well known" things and we can say that we'll have a wizard that would create a sceleton editor with those lines. But the point here is that we need to consider a general solution to this.)</description>

Actual:
Printed line does not look like it has line width 5, it looks just slightly thicker than 1. 

Also, if line type is dashed, dashes on the printed version appear to be much closer than on the screen, which makes them difficult to distinguish from solid lines.</description>

      <title>[planner] Inconsistent feature patch application</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: multiple

Applying a feature patch which updates a previous feature patch behaves differently and across eclipse version 3.4.2, 3.5.1 and 3.6 I20100115 build. The second patch is applied as expected only in 3.4.2 if original feature (not the patched) was installed with install UI and in 3.6 I build when original feature was dropped in.

My expectation was that this would work as expected and behave identical. 


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Will attach more detailed steps soon and used plugin/features zipped up. Below is an extended summary what I am seeing.

There are 3 versions of the hello plugin and one hello2 plugin. Each was generated with the hello world eclipse generator but the action was changed so that each one displays a different text in the message box shown when the button is clicked.

These Plugins are:
hello_1.0.0.200911201237.jar says 'Hello, Eclipse World'
hello_1.0.1.200911201237.jar says 'Hello2, Eclipse World'
hello_1.0.1.200911201358.jar says 'Hello3, Eclipse World'

hello2_1.0.0.200911201358.jar says 'Another Hello, Eclipse world plugin'

The original hello 1.0.0.* bundle is packed in feature 'hellofeature'

There are two consecutive feature patches:
1. feature patch hellopatch_1.0.0 which:
-&gt; updates hello to hello_1.0.1.200911201237 (msg: 'Hello2,...')

2. an update of that feature patch hellopatch_1.0.1.200911201358.jar which: 
-&gt; updates hello to hello_1.0.1.200911201358.jar (msg: 'Hello3,...')
-&gt; adds hello2 bundle (msg:'Another Hello...')

I tested applying these patches consecutively by dropping them into Eclipse SDK version 3.4.2, 3.5.1 and I build 20100115 of 3.6.

The first patch applied always as I expected, which means that hello bundle was always updated to hello_1.0.1.200911201237.jar which says 'Hello2, Eclipse World'

However the second patch did only apply as expected (having both bundles of second patch active) in 3.4.2, or in 3.6 when the original hellofeature was installed via drop in as well. Here is a summary on how dropping in the second patch behaved. 

I: If original hellofeature was installed via install UI:
3.4.2  OK.
3.5.1  second patch did have no effect.
3.6 I  second patch did have no effect.

II. If original hellofeature was installed via drop in:
3.4.2 strange mix: original hello bundle and hello2 bundle of second patch 
3.5.1 same as 3.4.2 
3.6 I OK</description>

      <title>Ecore Editor should be able to resolve platform:/plugin URLs from plugins in the target platform</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: 20090920-1017

When working on related models in separate projects, it would be very helpful to be able to reference models from bundles in the target platform, rather than requiring that shared models be installed into Eclipse itself.

I don't mind that the tooling may not be able to auto-discover models from the target platform, but if the user edits the Ecore and Genmodel files as XML and updates the paths the runtime should at least be able to find them.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Create an EMF model (org.example.common), and export it as an installable plug-in
2.  Remove org.example.common from your workspace
3.  Add org.example.common to your target platform.
4.  Create a new EMF model which references the org.example.common model as platform:/plugin/org.example.common/...</description>

      <title>Annotations: Need support for annotations containing EReference of * multiplicity</title>
      <description>It should be possible to use Tigerstripe annotation Eclass that contains EReference with multiplicity * to another Eclass.

TAF should allow at least (and possibly at most) one level of EReference with multiplicity * between annotation EClasses.

I'm not totally sure how this * multiplicity would be displayed in the properties view. Possibly as tree in the properties view as happens for EReference with single multiplicity currently, with the instances just numbered. Or it could all be done through a dialog that is opened via a button like that already used on the Multiline String attributes. The dialog could list the instances of the referenced class in a table with the attribute values of an instance displayed when it is selected in the table (with Add and remove buttons).

Which ever way the UI is implemented the referenced class may itself contain attributes of * multiplicity of either primitive or enums type.</description>

        EntityManager em = createEntityManager();
        List&lt;Address&gt; results = (List&lt;Address&gt;) em.createQuery("Select a from Address a").getResultList();
        Department dept1 = new Department("Dept1");
        Department dept2 = new Department("Dept2");
        beginTransaction(em);
        em.persist(dept1);
        em.persist(dept2);
        commitTransaction(em);
        em.clear();
        
        Employee emp = new Employee("Bob", "Bob");
        beginTransaction(em);
        em.persist(emp);
        emp.setDepartment(dept1);
        em.flush();
        emp.setDepartment(dept2); //&lt;-- only the UOW is checked for existence
        commitTransaction(em); //&lt;-- fails here
    }

When the Change Tracker event occurs EclipseLink uses UOW.isNewObject() to determine if the referenced object is new.  However this check assumes discoverAllUnregisteredNewObjects() has been called and in the case of Change Tracking that method is not called.

The solution here is to alter the path Change Tracking uses so that the detached is recognized as such or appropriate exceptions are thrown in the case of CascadeType.PERSIST</description>

      <title>[ui] Selected site lost in the work with section on page change</title>
      <description>3.6 I20100119

Setup:
- Eclipse platform binary with out of the box options
- Start and add the I build: http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/updates/3.6-I-builds
- Let the repo load, make sure you are in "groups items by category" mode
- Shutdown

Steps:
- Start eclipse
- Quickly go to the "Install new software..." option
- Select the I build repo from the drop down
- Once the content is displayed, select the SWT Tools category
- Type in the filter "Java", this reveals some the "Environment description for JavaSE1.6" but we are not interested in this.
- Uncheck the "group items by category", this reveals "Eclipse Java Development Tools", select it
- Click Next, as soon as the new page arrive, moves back to the previous page and notice that the site is no longer selected

Details:
At this point I have only been able to reproduce this as soon as I start eclipse (probably cause repos aren't cached) and the steps have to be executed quickly. I have noticed that if you stay "too long" on the install details page and it has the time to compute the size, then the problem does not occur. At this point I would be tempted to think that this problem occurs when the artifact repos are loaded.</description>

License page

3.6 I20100119
I'm installing a product (one IU) that is composed of 10 features licensed under the EPL. 
Two comments about this:
1) The name of the feature and the version are presented in one column which makes it ugly (see attachment)
2) The dependency information is lost which makes it hard to relate the presence of a license to anything that I'm installing

#1 could be addressed by putting the name and the version in two separate columns
#2 could either be added by:
   a) adding a context menu providing the relation ship to a root for each element (or maybe displaying that at the bottom of the page)
   b) preserve the tree presented in the install details page, but grey out the elements that are not applicable for a given license. So for example if you had two licenses used by one IU being installed, you would see the tree under each license entry.</description>

If you create more hardware breakpoints than are supported, (for example by typing 'hbreak var1' into GDB console 5 times on x86) and the continue, you get an error. However, the error message box itself does not say you're out of breakpoints and you can only see that information in the details pane of the error message. Some users don't realize they have useful non-technical information in the details pane.

This patch adds exceptions message to the directly shown message, as well as some suggestions to the user.

      <title>The color of the title of the group control cannot be changed</title>
      <description>Created attachment 156587 [details]
Code snippet

On my system (windows 7) the title's color of a group cannot be changed but stays black. Especially using setForegroundcolor has no effect. With black background the title is effectively invisible. I believe this to be unwanted behavior.

This issue has been already discussed in a newsgroup thread (http://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php?t=msg&amp;th=160475&amp;start=0&amp;) and could be confirmed by Grant Gayed. I provide a code snippet that shows the behavior.</description>

      <title>[ui] NPE upgrading SDK</title>
      <description>I attempted to upgrade from I20100115 to I20100119. At the end of the upgrade I got an NPE, and then the system froze in the "do you want to restart" dialog. I wasn't able to interact with the dialog and I had to kill the system. After startup things seem to be fine. Note I don't know if the NPE is related to the freeze but in my case they occurred at the same time.

      <title>eventConsumerJob in org.eclipse.epp.usagedata.internal.gathering.services.UsageDataService is never finished</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: 20090920-1017

The UserDataService class creates eventConsumerJob that, by default, is running while running Eclipse.
JBT PDE tests have to wait until all Eclipse jobs are finished (Eclipse builder, validators ...). The following method is used:

public static void waitForIdle(long delay) {
	long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
	
	while (!Job.getJobManager().isIdle()) {
		delay(delay);
		if ( (System.currentTimeMillis()-start) &gt; MAX_IDLE ) 
			throw new RuntimeException("A long running task detected"); //$NON-NLS-1$
	}
}

Since eventConsumerJob is never finished, this method throws RuntimeException after MAX_IDLE seconds.
It is not possible to stop monitoring without introducing a dependency to the org.eclipse.epp.usagedata.gathering plugin.

I see two solutions to solve the problem :

- creating eventConsumerJob so that it is started and finished periodically 
- the UsageDataCaptureActivator.start method would check for a system property (org.eclipse.epp.usagedata.gathering.disabled, for instance); if the property is true, the monitoring wouldn't be started. The tests could be started with the VM args -Dorg.eclipse.epp.usagedata.gathering.disabled=true
This solution is easier to implement.

A similar problem was existing in mylyn (https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=198241)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Job.getJobManager().isIdle() always returns false if org.eclipse.epp.usagedata.gathering is started.</description>

      <title>Reader creates WorkflowContext that causes Xpand generator to fail</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: 

There are two models, each one described by its own grammar. The first model defines data types and the second one contains entities. The entities model imports the data types by their fully-qualified names. When the generator workflow is executed, it is interrupted with the error message:

5689 INFO  CompositeComponent - Generator: generating 'templates::Main::main FOR model' =&gt; []
6299 ERROR AbstractExpressionsUsingWorkflowComponent - Error in Component  of type org.eclipse.xpand2.Generator: 
	EvaluationException : No Definition 'templates::Main::main for List' found!
	[23,38] on line 1 'EXPAND templates::Main::main FOR model'

The WorkflowContext created by the method Reader.invokeInternal() contains a HashMap with loaded models. The values of this HashMap are an ArrayList, whereas the Xpand generator expects a model element in org.eclipse.internal.xpand2.ast.ExpandStatement.evaluateInternal().

When I use FOREACH in the workflow file, the workflow execution doesn't succeed either:

3396 INFO  CompositeComponent - Generator: generating 'templates::Main::main FOREACH model' =&gt; []
3941 ERROR AbstractExpressionsUsingWorkflowComponent - Error in Component  of type org.eclipse.xpand2.Generator: 
	EvaluationException : No Definition 'templates::Main::main for types::Namespace' found!
	[23,42] on line 1 'EXPAND templates::Main::main FOREACH model'
	
That's right because there is only one Xpand template for the entities model and no template for the data types model.

      <title>Eclipse fails to start and gives no explanation when using 64 bit eclipse with a 32 bit jvm.</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: 20090920-1017

When using a 64 bit version of eclipse and the 32 bit sun jvm eclipse fails to start and gives no details as to why.  

I don't expect 64 bit eclipse to work with a 32 bit jvm but it would be nice if I got some kind of warning instead of the process just terminating itself without printing anything to the terminal session.  


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install 64 bit eclipse
2. Install 32 bit sun jvm
3. Start eclipse with 'path/to/eclipse/eclipse -vm /path/to/32bit/jvm' from a terminal</description>

      <description>Build Identifier: M20090917-0800

When you have an enum constant with a class body, and declare a local class within a method in the enum constant class body, Eclipse generates the default constructor for that local class without the required super() call. The verifier then rightly rejects that class.

See upcoming attached example.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run the attached program in Eclipse, and watch it fail verification.
2. Compile the same program with Sun javac, and watch it run successfully.</description>

      <title>classpathentry OPTIONAL attribute not honored for var entries</title>
      <description>The OPTIONAL attribute for classpath entries doesn't appear to work for variable classpath entries.

For example, we'd like to use the following entry in our classpath file:
	&lt;classpathentry kind="var" path="ECLIPSE_INSTALL/plugins/org.apache.ant_1.7.0.v200803061910/lib/ant.jar"&gt;
		&lt;attributes&gt;
			&lt;attribute name="optional" value="true"/&gt;
		&lt;/attributes&gt;
	&lt;/classpathentry&gt;

Basically, we want our projects to use this classpath entry if the ECLIPSE_INSTALL variable is defined. But if it's not, then we still want the project to compile.

We'd like the OPTIONAL attribute on variable entries to work the same way it does for source entries. For example:
	&lt;classpathentry kind="src" path="bar"&gt;
		&lt;attributes&gt;
			&lt;attribute name="optional" value="true"/&gt;
		&lt;/attributes&gt;
	&lt;/classpathentry&gt;

If the folder "bar" doesn't exist, the project will still compile.</description>

      <title>[transport] Proxy details set within Eclipse are ignored by 'Install New Software'</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: 20090920-1017

Proxy setting in Eclipse are ignored for 'Install New Software'.

In order to run 'Install New Software' behind a web proxy you must set the environment variables http_proxy=http://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;  and possibly ftp_proxy=http://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;.
Authentication must also be specified in the environment variables.

Seems pointless to have proxy setings that are ignored.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set proxy settings in Eclipse correctlly
2. Attempt to Install New Software
3. Eclipse fails to download repository information.
4. Exit Eclipse
5. Set environment variables http_proxy &amp; ftp_proxy
6. Reload Eclipse
7. Attempt to install new software.</description>

      <title>[widgets] TreeItem.getTextBounds() returns width of longest visible item</title>
      <description>I call this on selection on different TreeItems and the only time the width changes is on expansion or contraction if the expansion or contraction makes a different in the total width of all TreeItems (which are in the viewport or not).

I'm using TreeItem.getTextBounds() to determine the end location of the text (to draw a graphic).

Previously I used TreeItem.getBounds() which on Linux and Windows corresponded to the actual text width, however on Cocoa it's the entire width of the tree.

Let me know if you need a snippet and I can make one.

I suppose a workaround (and probably even a better implementation for what I'm trying to do) for my problem is to listen to the Paint event and draw the line there based on the data in the event (like Snippet220).</description>

      <title>Support remote cross referencing with a convenient API on the client and SPI on the server for the stores to implement</title>
      <description>It would be great to extend CDO with the possibility to query all the objects referencing a certain object. The so-called crossreferencing (or xref) functionality. 

Using the model available on the server it is possible to determine for each EClass what queries are needed to retrieve the referencing objects.

A thing to consider is how to handle larger volumes of referencing objects. It is clearly possible that multiple queries are needed to retrieve all cross referencers so it can be difficult to implement paging or sublist behavior. So maybe the client api can pass in a max number of returned objects.

To support xref I think we need:
- an api and convenience method on the client
- a server side api definition 
- implementation of this functionality in each store

Eike and others let me know if you have any comments or feedback on this. 

Thanks!

      <title>Monospace fonts in mediawiki editor look strange</title>
      <description>We examined the WikiText mediawiki editor for documentation purposes, but in Windows machines we got an interesting formatting of preformatted text (that gets a monospace font-family): it becomes very large, and does not seem to respond to changing font-size (even to 1%).

This type of output was present on a Windows XP machine, a similar, but less obtrusive one on Windows Vista, while on Mac OSX the monospace font looked as expected.

We are interested whether a default setting is not appropriate (e.g. we did not found a font setting), or something in the Wikitext editor did go wrong.

Thanks for your help.</description>

      <title>In development mode, real bundle class path is inconsistent with bundle classpath header</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: 20090920-1017

Wenn deploying a bundle to Equinox in PDE, care is taken, that the bundle classpath is adjusted. For instances, the "bin" folder of the project is included in the bundle classpath, with the help of the "dev.properties" file.

So far so good.

But this bundle classpath is inconsistent with the bundle classpath header then, which can be queried by bundleContext.getBundle().getHeaders().get(Constants.BUNDLE_CLASSPATH).

Thus, framework that rely on this way to get the bundle classpath, will fail. (AFAIK, there is no other way to get bundle classpath...)

An example is Spring for dynamic modules:  To support classpath component scanning it uses the bundle classpath header.  In development mode, this will always fail, since it is only the root directory, but not "bin".

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create some bundle 
2. In the activator, get the bundle classpath header by bundleContext.getBundle().getHeaders().get(Constants.BUNDLE_CLASSPATH)
3. Run the bundle with PDE. You will see, the bundle classpath header is inconsistent with real bundle classpath (which includes "bin" folder)</description>

2. the one in ${BuildDirectory} is the modified version of the in ${baseLocation}, so I need all of dependencies of plugins in the ${BuildDirectory} refers to the one in ${BuildDirectory}

In 3.6M4, the plugin in the ${baseLocation} seem be choosed other than those in the ${BuildDirectory}.

      <description>Build Identifier: Eclipse Platform  Version: 3.5.1 Build id: M20090917-0800

If I rename or drug and drop file in Navigator window in console I see svn delete and svn add command. This not right behavour becouse the history of file changes is lost (After svn add file become as new).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open project. (I use Perl Epic)
2. Select file in "Navigator" window and press F2
3. In "Rename Resource" dialog write new name and press OK
4. In "Console" window you can see `svn delete` command
5. Or if you attempt commit folder contain this file (right mouse click on folder -&gt; Team -&gt; Commit...)  in change log you can see `&lt;old_filename&gt; Deleted` and `&lt;new_filename&gt; Added` commands.</description>

      <title>[Combo] Item is deselected but the text remains visible</title>
      <description>Hi all,

I'm trying to deselect combo item with various method I could find, eventhough the deselection works but the combo text is still visible. 

The following is the snippet to reproduce the problem :

...
@Override
public void createPartControl(Composite parent)
{
  parent.setLayout(GridLayoutFactory.fillDefaults().margins(5, 5).numColumns(2)
.create());
  toolkit.adapt(parent);
		
  final ComboViewer viewer = new ComboViewer(parent,SWT.READ_ONLY);
  viewer.add(new String[]{"Option 1","Option 2","Option 3"});
    
  viewer.getCombo().setLayoutData(GridDataFactory.swtDefaults().create());
    
  Button button = toolkit.createButton(parent, "Clear", SWT.PUSH);
  button.setLayoutData(GridDataFactory.swtDefaults().create());
    
  button.addSelectionListener
  (
    new SelectionAdapter()
    {
	@Override
	public void widgetSelected(SelectionEvent e)
	{
	  viewer.setSelection(null);					  //viewer.getCombo().deselect(viewer.getCombo()
.getSelectionIndex());
//viewer.getCombo().deselectAll();
					
	System.out.println("selection index : " +  viewer.getCombo().getSelectionIndex());
	System.out.println("combo text : " + viewer.getCombo().getText());
	}
     }
  );
}
...

Step to reproduce :
1. Select combo item.
2. Click 'Clear' button to deselect.
3. The combo text is still visible eventhough the console prints the right state.
4. Try the other commented methods, the result is the same.

I've tried in RCP with all methods and they all work fine there.

      <title>[formatter] Java source formatting of a section or a project failes when /*"*/ is inside a string concat</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: M20090917-0800

When a java file contains the line:

    String s="X"+/*"*/"Y";

then this section cannot be formatted with shift-control-F or menu source-Format.
Even worse: when using Menu source-&gt;Format on multiple projects or working set this small line completely cancels the formatting action. Therefore the bug is not just a minor one but has massive impact on the formatting feature which cannot be reasonably used anymore when having such sections in the source code.

The code snippet that causes this effect can of course be written differentlly, but anyway the code snippet is valid java code, compiles correctly and conforms to the java syntax rules.

The exception log follows:

testcase

Testing e4/XWT Designer, we have noticed a bug of Shell.computeTrim() in windows when the menu is empty. The height has 20 pixels more. 

Playing with the testcase, if there is no MenuBar, the result is 
Rectangle {-4, -26, 8, 30}

With the empty MenuBar, the result is
Rectangle {-4, -46, 8, 50}

In fact, it should be same.</description>

      <description>Working with the FormEditor, and adding objects from the Forms ToolKit Items,
give very often refresh errors and in the worst cases the objects in the editor become uneditable. The Java beans view page that usually shows the structure, becomes truncated at a high level (in the hierarchy) composite, no object is visible under it (I presume therefore no element becomes editable).

I tried: restarting the file, restarting eclipse and recreating the workspace but does not seem to solve anything. 
The only workaround that worked (which actually is not), was redo everything from scratch. (quite bad I think).

I'm using the latest Eclipse RCP distribution with the latest VE 1.4

      <id>300172</id>
      <title>Marker Example - Bottom buttons in MarkerSubModuleView not hidden</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: 

== Symptom ==========
When the hidden checkbox at the top of the view is selected, all hidable controls shall be hidden. Currently, the 'Push' button as well as two radio buttons and a checkbox button remain visible.

In Riena, push buttons mapped to an IActionRidget are not markable and therefore cannot be hidden (because this is done through hidden markers). So it is expected behavior for the 'Push' button not to be hidden.

However, the radio and check buttons to the right of the 'Push' button *should* be hidden.

== Reason ==========
I looked into this and found that the push button's presence meant that there was a corresponding null entry in the 'markables' array field inside MarkerSubModuleController.HiddenActionListener. This led to an uncaught NPE that aborted the loop over all ridgets to be hidden, and therefore setVisible(false) was never called on the remaining ridgets (i.e. the radio and checkbox buttons).

== Solution (see attachment) ==========
* I added a check on null in the loop over the markables array to fix the bug in the example client.
* As it seems, I am not the first (and most probably not the last) to stumble upon the 'Push' button's stubborn visibility. I therefore added a descriptive label below the button in question explaining that this is expected behavior, and why.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start example client demo.
2. Playground -&gt; Playground -&gt; Marker
3. Click 'hidden' checkbox.
4. Radio buttons and checkbox button (at the very bottom of the view) are still visible.</description>

      <title>[Browser] Problem with refreshing pages in internal web browser when IE8 installed</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: I20091210-1301

Internal web browser has sometimes problem with refresh its content when open
new page. Moreover this problem disappears when you click "refresh" button. I
have observed such situation when IE8 installed but some people noticed on older versions of IE. Generally caching some content is normal behaviour of IE. When you try to open any site in IE and then open it in new window or tab you will get cached version. But when we are developing web application and want to test it, this action is inexpedient.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create new dynamic web project and add index.html file in WebContent
directory.
2. Right click on index.html file. Select "Run as -&gt; Run on Server". You should
see html file in your internal browser.
3. Modify index.html content. Select "Run as -&gt; Run on Server" again. You get
old content of file.</description>

ConvertToFacetHandler

Bug 295544 introduces functionality that should be available from the Configure submenu in the context menu.

A first-pass implementation could look like:

   &lt;extension
         point="org.eclipse.ui.commands"&gt;
      &lt;command
            categoryId="org.eclipse.ui.category.file"
            defaultHandler="org.eclipse.example.ConvertToFacetHandler"
            id="org.eclipse.example.convertToFacets"
            name="Convert Project to Faceted Form"&gt;
      &lt;/command&gt;
   &lt;/extension&gt;
   &lt;extension
         point="org.eclipse.ui.menus"&gt;
         &lt;menuContribution
           locationURI="popup:org.eclipse.ui.projectConfigure?after=additions"&gt;
         &lt;command commandId="org.eclipse.example.convertToFacets" style="push"&gt;
            &lt;visibleWhen checkEnabled="false"&gt;
               &lt;and&gt;
                  &lt;count value="1"/&gt;
                  &lt;iterate  ifEmpty="false"  operator="and"&gt;
                     &lt;adapt type="org.eclipse.core.resources.IProject"/&gt;
                  &lt;/iterate&gt;
               &lt;/and&gt;
            &lt;/visibleWhen&gt;
         &lt;/command&gt;
      &lt;/menuContribution&gt;
   &lt;/extension&gt;


The visibleWhen could be extended with a test if you need a specific project nature before you can turn it into a project that understands facets:
&lt;adapt type="org.eclipse.core.resources.IResource"&gt;
  &lt;test property="org.eclipse.core.resources.projectNature" 
     value="the.nature.you.expect"/&gt;
&lt;/adapt&gt;

http://wiki.eclipse.org/Command_Core_Expressions describes some more project properties that can be tested.

      <title>Custom file hiding filters in Project Explorer</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: 

When building a library with automake it generates intermediate files that are not covered by any, in CDT, existing file filter. For example, .Plo and .lo.
It would be nice to be able to filter them out to decrease the number of files visible in the file tree.

The best thing would be the possibility to add new filters to the list. (Customize view..)

Second best alternative is to offer an edit box where one can put a comma-separated list of filters. Like for Package Explorer in JDT.

      <description>Build Identifier: 20090920-1017

When selecting the XML input file to run an XSL Transformation, the file chooser only allows the selection of files who are explicitly declared as XML files in the General/Content Types preference.

It would be more user-friendly if the chooser allowed the selection of files with any extension (*.*) as a workaround.

debug options for my infocenter

Build ID: I20091210-1301 (Eclipse 3.6m4)

I launch a headless infocenter with debugging enabled (see attached doc.options file, which I pass on the commandline via -debug doc.options).
I see this in the workspace/.metadata/.log file:

!MESSAGE Error reading help table of contents file /"com.windriver.ide.doc.wr_gnu_compiler_linux/wr_gnu_compiler_using_gnu_compiler_collection_linux_4.3/html/wr_gnu_toc.xml, URL = file:/net/szg-rhfs/szg-rhfs03/t5-dev/daily_WB/201001200813/test_WB/docs/extensions/eclipse/plugins/com.windriver.ide.doc.wr_gnu_compiler_linux/wr_gnu_compiler_using_gnu_compiler_collection_linux_4.3/html/wr_gnu_toc.xml" (skipping file)
!STACK 0
org.xml.sax.SAXParseException: The entity "mdash" was referenced, but not declared.

and find it problematic identifying the exact location where SAX thinks that "mdash" was referenced. I think that Eclipse should know the location, since I see this on stdout of my infocenter:

[Fatal Error] :14:55: The entity "mdash" was referenced, but not declared.

and in fact the issue is on line 14 column 55 of the referenced file. Since Eclipse knows the exact location, I think it should be logged (like it is for errors during indexing).</description>

JDT has an option to trigger code formatting when saving a source file.
This is great when a project tries to maintain the same formatting in all source files but people forgets to press Ctrl+Shift+F in order to format the file before saving.

Would it be possible to add this for CDT too?

      <title>When a project is not part of a train, add a visual clue to the translation tool</title>

Screenshot

This is an idea I got from this forum post:
http://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php?t=msg&amp;th=161000&amp;start=0&amp;

In the translation tool, it is possible for translators to contribute without the project even being included in a release train.  In the case above, CDT 6.0 was not associated with Galileo, and therefore the language packs were not being built.

See attachment.  Putting a small visual clue directly in the tool, which would indicate that the project is not properly configured (and would link to opening a bug against Babel), would help avoid this.</description>

      <title>bad interaction between Table and a Canvas with SWT.TRANSPARENT</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: 20090920-1017

when a Canvas with SWT.TRANSPARENT is drawn somewhere on the shell, the table scrollbars become very slow (they use much CPU resources, hang sometimes at scrolling). This happens although there is no connection between the Canvas and the Table (they are not drawn over each other); it seems that the table scroll triggers some unnecessary redraw on the Canvas. This problem does not occur with other scrollbars like the ones created from ScrolledForm.

Note: This bug may be specific to Windows XP.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Execute the Code snippet attached
2. Scroll the table a little bit, observing the UI response time and the CPU resources (e.g. in the Windows Taskmanager)
3. comment out the content of the method createCanvas and do 1. and 2. again
4. the UI should now response much faster, much less CPU resources are used now</description>

      <title>version of org.eclipse.equinox.p2.user.ui feature in 3.6 stream</title>
      <description>The version compare tool is reporting that the version of org.eclipse.equinox.p2.user.ui feature should be 2.0.0. Looking at the plugins in the feature, there are indeed some 2.0.0 versions.  Not sure what do to here because incrementing the version of this feature will cascade up to other features.  Should this be ignored in the version compare tool?

&lt;Info Code="1" Message="The version of the feature (id: "org.eclipse.equinox.p2.user.ui"; version: "1.2.0.v20100115-1055-837BFivFdHjNz-AkJAiX6iX_"; location: "/buildtest/I20100119-0800/eclipse-testing/test-eclipse/eclipse/releng/eclipse/features/org.eclipse.equinox.p2.user.ui_1.2.0.v20100115-1055-837BFivFdHjNz-AkJAiX6iX_/feature.xml") should be at least "2.0.0"."/&gt;</description>

      <title>New Class wizzard should be able to create a class in enclosing method</title>
      <description>New Class wizzard in Eclipse should be able to define a class in an enclosing method of a class. It is perfectly OK to do in Java standard, so it should be in new class wizzard. 

New class wizzard should have another checkbox with enclosing method where a user could select a method where new class would be placed. 

About source code placement of this new class, it should be ABOVE any references to this new class, if a class was created using Quick-Fix wizzard complaining about a class not found. I don't know why Eclipse enforces this, I think that class placement should be irelevant.

This should be a quick fix.

      <title>[Sync View][Apply Patch] Use native Synchronize naming for actions</title>
      <description>Branch "branch_20091215_bug236169"

Initially we though renaming "Merge" to "Apply" was a good idea, as this is how the action is named in the apply patch world. We changed our minds, we will stick to the native Synchronize naming. The same thing applies to "Remove from View" which we though should be named as "Exclude", we will leave it as it is.</description>

      <title>[CommonNavigator] Popup menu items cannot be created in Project Explorer using the Command Framework</title>
      <description>I tried to define a command in the popup menu of the Project Navigator using the following xml descriptor:

&lt;menuContribution
            locationURI="popup:org.eclipse.ui.navigator.ProjectExplorer"&gt;
         &lt;menu
            label="Test"&gt;
            &lt;command
                  commandId="com.optxware.commanddemo.helloworld"
                  style="push"&gt;
            &lt;/command&gt;
         &lt;/menu&gt;
      &lt;/menuContribution&gt;
      
 Using this descriptor no contribution item appeared. By replacing the ''popup'' part with ''menu'', it appeared in the menu of the view, as expected.
 By replacing the view ID with the JDT's Package Explorer (org.eclipse.jdt.ui.PackageExplorer), both the ''popup'' and the ''menu'' contributions were created as expected.
 
Do you have any idea what might have gone wrong? Thank you for your help.</description>

User should be informed that project from a patch is not accessible (doesn't exist, is closed, etc). Current implementation in the branch will not display the project. This may be acceptable when applying a patch for a single project (user will get a suspicious message saying the patch contains no changes), but for multiple projects this may result in omitting part of the patch without noticing it.</description>

      <description>If a TypeResource is created for a Java Class that doesn't compile (in my scenario, its super-type wasn't available), the resource-object is created flawlessly, but its contents remains empty.

This leads to the exception quoted below when getEObject() is called.

It would be good to have some kind of protocol to notify the code which is using the TypeResource about the invalid state of the referenced Java stuff.

I observed this behavior in an Xtext-version from 2009-12-17. If it has changed in the meantime, let me know.

      <description>Created attachment 156672 [details]
Fix

HEAD

org.eclipse.core.commands.operations.TriggeredOperations should implement IAdvancedUndoableOperation2.

In bug 291787, I tried to push the execution of refactoring changes to the background by letting our UndoableOperation2ChangeAdapter implement IAdvancedUndoableOperation2. When the Undo command is invoked, such a change adapter is being used as triggeringOperation in a TriggeredOperations, but the runInBackground() is not being forwarded to my adapter.

The attached patch implements this. The fix for bug 291787 does not work without this fix, but since it does not harm either, I've already released it.</description>

After some reasearch I found that the org.eclipse.equinox.internal.app.EclipseAppContainer is looking for the branding oinformation and for the application information. Espcially I could observe the following confusing behavior:

1. the eclipse.product property inside of the resources block of JNLP file pointing to the product-id: the exception above is delivered
2. the eclipse.application property inside of the resources block of JNLP file pointing to the application-id: the exception above is delivered
3. both properties eclipse.product and eclipse.application set inside of resources block: the application (without branding) is started
4. the "-product product-id" is passed using two argument elements of the application-desc element of the JNLP file: theapplication (without branding) is started.

Reproducible: Always

      <title>[ui] Very slow filtering in install wizard</title>
      <description>I20100119-0800

Typing in the filter box in the install wizard takes a very long time. It seems to freeze for up to 5 seconds on every keystroke, even though the repository is already loaded at this point. I took a couple of stack dumps that point to some potential hotspots, but we'll likely need to run with a profiler to get a good picture of where the bottlenecks are.

Stack 1:

      <title>[Wizard] Generate abstract/concrete WSDL definitions</title>
      <description>The New WSDL file wizard currently generates an "all in one" WSDL definition. This definition file contains both the abstract (types, messages, port type) and concrete (bindings, services) components. In order to maximize the re-use of the abstract components, customers tend to split the two set of components in two or more WSDL definition files. This allows them to create additional bindings/services that re-use the port type definition.

This enhancement will modify the New WSDL wizard to provide support for generating two WSDL definitions: an abstract one and a concrete one.</description>

      <title>ImageStore should support pathes to images</title>
      <description>As far as I know Riena ImageStore supports only unique names of icons / images.
But in reality it can happen that the same name of an Icon is located in different sizes at different pathes.

per ex. if following the naming schema 
http://standards.freedesktop.org/icon-naming-spec/icon-naming-spec-latest.html
this can happen:

/icons/16x16/apps/office-calendar.png
/icons/32x32/apps/office-calendar.png

at the moment I have to rename / relocate like this:

/icons/office-calendar-16x16.png
/icons/office-calendar-32x32.png

but it would be better to register the path 
icons
at extension ImagePaths

and use as icon names
16x16/apps/office-calendar.png
32x32/apps/office-calendar.png

if we change the first part of getImageDescriptor(String fullName) as follows,
this would be possible.

what do you think ?

----------------------------
	private ImageDescriptor getImageDescriptor(String fullName) {
		
		String[] fullNamePathes = fullName.split("/");
		if (fullNamePathes.length &gt; 1) {
			String fileName = fullNamePathes[fullNamePathes.length-1];
			String filePath = fullName.substring(0, fullName.length()-fileName.length());
			for (IImagePathExtension iconPath : iconPathes) {
				String fullPath = iconPath.getPath() + '/'; 
				if (fullPath.endsWith(filePath)) {
					fullPath = fullPath + fileName;
					URL url = iconPath.getContributingBundle().getResource(fullPath);
					if (url != null) {
						return ImageDescriptor.createFromURL(url);
					}
				}
			}
		} else {
			for (IImagePathExtension iconPath : iconPathes) {
				String fullPath = iconPath.getPath() + '/' + fullName;
				URL url = iconPath.getContributingBundle().getResource(fullPath);
				if (url != null) {
					return ImageDescriptor.createFromURL(url);
				}
			}
		}

      <title>SWT_AWT bridge and a Transparent Composite cause 100% cpu</title>
      <description>Created attachment 156693 [details]
Repro case.

In our application, I've determined that using the SWT_AWT bridge to display an AWT control, and also set the SWT.Transparent flag on an SWT Composite, leads to 100% cpu under Windows XP.   It seems the AWT control may be constantly painting.  It only occurs in this configuration.

I've attached some code to repro the issue.

Please run SWT_AWT_BridgeTest on a Windows XP system (bare metal), using SWT 3.5.0.  This bug does not occur on Vista, or when running XP in a virtual environment under Vista.

Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.  James</description>

      <description>Status is *Closed* with a resolution of *Cannot Reproduce*, however the task in the task list is not shown with strikethrough gray font.  Also I can schedule it in Mylyn, which leads me to believe that Mylyn thinks it is not complete.

Mylyn should consider resolved and closed tasks as complete regardless of resolution.  Either that or Mylyn should provide a means to configure what statuses or resolutions are considered complete on a per-repository basis.</description>

The loading of the children of a composite repository should be happening in parallel. Today this seems to be done sequentially and makes the opening of a large repo like the 3.6-I-builds rather long since it has at least 10 children.
The space where this is the most point is when you are returning to the repo and you know the content is already cached.</description>

      <title>InterruptedException from servlet container thread</title>
      <description>We have this exception occur sometimes when we logout of our RAP application.

The way we log out is that we have a custom widget that redirects to a JSP page when we set a URL on it. When this happens, we occasionally get the exception below. The application has a UICallBack registered as well and this seems to cause the problem.

11 Jan 2010 11:36:47,254 | 9451458     [ERROR] {http-8080-Processor17} 
(org.apache.tomcat.util.threads.ThreadPool) Unexpected exception
java.lang.InterruptedException
        at java.lang.Object.wait(Native Method)
        at java.lang.Object.wait(Object.java:485)
        at 
org.apache.tomcat.util.threads.ThreadPool$ControlRunnable.run(ThreadPool.java:661)
        at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:619)

The interrupt is coming from the UICallbackManager.blockCallBackRequest in the beforeDestroy implementation of the SessionStoreListener.

The problem only manifests itself if you use Tomcat as the servlet container as it logs the InterruptedException in it's HTTP processing threads. Other containers such as Jetty seem to ignore the exception completely.

I have attached a patch that fixes the problm for us.</description>

      <title>Need Incubator Update Site</title>
      <description>It would be nice to have the ability for the Incubator projects that aren't necessarily on the same release schedule or requirements as the main WTP projects to have their own incubation site.   This can be one combined site.

The Mylyn project already does this

Mylyn - download.eclipse.org/tools/mylyn/update/incubator

They provide both a stable project update site, as well as a separate site for those projects and components that are incubating.   I think it is a good model to follow as it clearly separates what is considered a stable project from those that are still incubating and under some more drastic changes and development.

It would be nice to have Vex, RelaXNG, XQDT, and XML Security milestones be able to be installed from the Update site.  I believe p2.director has some functionality to make this happen.</description>

      <title>Enhancement Request - Add "create" methods to DynamicEntity</title>
      <description>Proposal:

Add the following API to DynamicEntity:

/**
 * Create and set the DynamicEntity value based on the property name.
 * For List properties, create and add the DynamicEntity value based
 * on the property name.
 */
public DynamicEntity newDynamicEntity(String propertyName); 

Advantage:
- Need to know fewer type names.
- Fewer lines of code required.

Current API:

DynamicEntity customer = dynamicHelper.newDynamicEntity("example.Customer");
customer.set("name", "Jane Doe");

DynamicEntity address = dynamicHelper.newDynamicEntity("example.Address");
address.set("street", "123 Any Street");
customer.set("address", address);

List phoneNumbers = new ArrayList();
DynamicEntity phoneNumber1 = dynamicHelper.newDynamicEntity("example.PhoneNumber");
phoneNumber1.set("number", "613-555-1111");
phoneNumbers.add(phoneNumber1);
DynamicEntity phoneNumber2 = dynamicHelper.newDynamicEntity("example.PhoneNumber");
phoneNumber2.set("number", "613-555-2222");
phoneNumbers.add(phoneNumber2);
customer.set("phoneNumbers", phoneNumbers);


Same as above using proposed API:

DynamicEntity customer = dynamicHelper.newDynamicEntity("example.Customer");
customer.set("name", "Jane Doe");

DynamicEntity address = customer.newDynamicEntity("address");
address.set("street", "123 Any Street");

DynamicEntity phoneNumber1 = customer.newDynamicEntity("phoneNumbers");
phoneNumber1.set("number", "613-555-1111");
DynamicEntity phoneNumber2 = customer.newDynamicEntity("phoneNumbers");
phoneNumber2.set("number", "613-555-2222");</description>

      <title>Modernize the Eclipse Logo</title>
      <description>This bug isn't truly against the website, it's really a marketing question, but I didn't know where else to put it.

In bug 274551, we started discussing a significantly revised splash screen.
This brings up the question of logo and related marketing materials.

In e4, we are designing an updated visual style for eclipse (see bug 293481) and I assumed we would do at least some updating of the splash.  (The e4 tech preview had its own splash).

In bug 274551 we were discussing the UI elements within eclipse, as well as the marketing materials outside of the software itself that are based on the eclipse splash logo:

- window icons
- about dialog graphics
- plug-in branding icons
- marketing images shown in
http://www.eclipse.org/artwork/index.php

The big picture question, then, is are we going to redesign the basic theme/logo for Eclipse for e4?

If so, then the splash would follow this new design.
If not, then we may choose to just update the splash in other ways - keeping the basic image and typography and updating the background elements or color choices.</description>

      <title>[ui] Change private method to protected on RepositoryNameAndLocationDialog</title>
      <description>I previously had to ask that a operations package get exported so I could reuse a constant from it in PDE.  The purpose of that was to reuse the add repo location dialog without it preventing duplicate entries in the agent.  Using the constant I can prevent the error, but the ok button still becomes disabled if there is a duplicate entry.

To override this behaviour I need the setOkEnablement method to be protected rather than private.  The change seems reasonable to me as the majority of other methods modifying dialog elements are protected.

Patch attached. Please get this in for M5, sorry for leaving it so long.</description>

      <title>Need e4 splash screen and need to define scope of change</title>
      <description>When e4 ships, it will presumably have a cool, new splash screen.
We had interesting ideas/submissions for the tech preview, and I'm sure there will be lots of creative ideas for the final release.

I think the scope of change needs to be figured out the foundation/marketing level first.  Many of the marketing materials are derived from the logo in the splash screen.  If the basic logo is to change, that should likely be addressed first.

For example, we could hold a contest, but I think the contest should first establish the logo and branding, followed by the splash itself.  If the basic logo/branding is not to change, then we can scope the splash to be more of a "sprucing up" of the existing splash.  Using the same logo (image and typography), but perhaps playing with color or backgrounds

I opened bug 300271 against the foundation for the broader question.  This question can track the specific issue of a splash once we've scoped the larger question.</description>

      <title>Java Class Constructor class</title>
      <description>Hacking the "New Java Class" wizard from JDT makes me itch. It's just not the right approach.

I propose the creation of a constructor class whose instances are able to create a new Java class. The constructor can be helpful and relatively high-level. Use could be along the lines of:

JavaClassConstructor constructor = new JavaClassConstructor();
constructor.setClassName("MyClass");
// constructor.setUseDefaultPackage(true);
constructor.setPackage("my.package.name");
constructor.setProjectName("My Java Project");
constructor.setCreateProjectIfNecessary(true);
constructor.construct();

The instance should be created with reasonable defaults, so that a user can provide minimal configuration and still get something useful. Taking a project name (rather than a project instance), makes it the constructor's responsibility to find the actual project instance when it gets the construct() directive. If the createProjectIfNecessary property is set, the project will be created. Note that we may need additional values to create the project (such as the Java version string, or something).

It'd also be cool if the various properties are observable (check out ListenerList) so that a GUI can hook into them. But that's relatively low priority.

Note that this class should not have any GUI elements to it. By detaching it completely from the GUI, we make it very reusable in other contexts.

I may take a run at an initial implementation of this tonight. Feel free to beat me to it.</description>

      <title>standard schemas version should get a minor bump</title>
      <description>While fixing bug 300090, it appeared to me, if I am reading branches right, that the jst.standard.schema bundle should get a "minor" version number bump. 

It appears its only gotten "service" updates so far. 

And, especially with Helios, and all the Java EE 6 stuff, seems it is definitely "new function". 

I'm not sure there is any practical consequences, but seems we should "follow the rules" as best we can, just in case. 

I did not want to make change in version number at the last minute before an I-build, so opened this bug ... and will leave it up to others to decide when is the right time to do it. Before M5? After M5?

On the "Available Software Sites" preference page, there is (what appears to be) a text box under the list of sites.  I thought maybe this shows details when a site is selected, but nothing seems to affect the area.</description>

      <title>Can't connect to files on a networkshare</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: M20090917-0800

I tried to open my git repo on a windows network share (samba, cifs). First I used file://server/share and I tried file://P:/ while P: is the mounted network share. Then I tried smb://server/share/ but it doesn't work. I guess it the problem is that java get the files mapped correctly from Windows API. The solution is to add a new Transport Class and add it in  324    org.eclipse.jgit.transport.Transport;     public static Transport open(final Repository local, final URIish remote) or better make a way to add Transport plugins to support flexible protocols.

      <title>[EMF Compare] Unrelated non-containment deleted</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: 20090920-1017

I have a model that has a node with a two non-containment references:

1) noncontainmentHolder
2) noncontainmentNoncontainmentHolder

The first one points references an object that it does not contain.  The second references an object that it does not contain and that object references another object it does not contain.

In the unit test, I change the first reference in the right model, but leave the rest of the references the same.  If the second reference does not belong to a resource, then it will be deleted by DefaultMerger.removeDanglingReferences(...).

This happens because the CrossReferencer returns it in the iterator and it is then removed by the DefaultMerger.

      <title>Refactoring confuses subversive and leads to unresolveable conflicts</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: 20090920-1017

Any task in eclipse (such as refactoring) which results in a folder being moved causes Subversive to get in a very confused state. I'm experiencing this while using maven as the build environment, I have not tested outside that environment. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Test1.java
Test2.java

Commit to SVN
Update SVN

Refactor&gt;rename the package to test.newpackage.

Now try and commit the changes and it will get confused on the new files as they have already been copied to the new location on the server

It becomes even worse if some files are not in SVN.</description>

      <title>did I mess up wtpBuild permissions or group?</title>
      <description>Or did you? :) 

a week ago, (at least) wtpBuild was creating directories/files with an owner group of 'webtools.releng-dev', with the group having RWX permissions. Now it is creating them with 'users' group, with no group write permissions. 

This appears to be causing our WTP builds to not work right (I think maybe only "tests" don't work right). I'm not sure how/why this would effect my scripts, but thought I'd open this bug while I continue to investigate. 

If this was an intentional change, fine ... but thought maybe "wtpBuild" was put in wrong "group" or something?

      <title>Could not load SWT library</title>
      <description>I20100119-0800 

After moving up to latest I-build, started seeing this problem loading/finding the "swt library". 

This _might_ be only on PPC? It _might_ be only if XULRunner path specified, as we (have to) do on build.eclipse.org. It seems to work ok on a linux x86 box, where I do not set the xulrunner path. 

On build.eclipse.org, for our production builds, I set 

     org.eclipse.swt.browser.XULRunnerPath
to
     /shared/common/mozilla-xulrunner181-1.8.1.4-30.ppc

(and have been for month or more, using M4, at least). 

I'm not sure where the "tmp" comes from in the following stack trace. That looks suspicious? 

But I do set -Djava.io.tmpdir to /shared/webtools/tmp/ ... can't imagine why SWT would be using a tmp directory? I'm just mentioning it in case relevant. 

I've set to blocker, since if I'm seeing this right, we in WTP can't run our JUnit tests with this build. 

Thanks,

      <title>Eclipse compiler chosen complaince level as 1.4 with source 1.4 target 1.5</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: M20060921-0945

I am using ANT (version 1.6.2) and eclipse java compiler (version 3.2.2.r322) to compile my java project.

In javac task, I specified target="1.5" and source="1.4" to compile my sources. I am getting an error saying that "[javac] Compliance level '1.4' is incompatible with target level '1.5'. A compliance level '1.5' or better is required"

&lt;javac compiler="org.eclipse.jdt.core.JDTCompilerAdapter" destdir="c:/tmp/bin" target="1.5" source="1.4"&gt;

I saw the comptability table in the site http://help.eclipse.org/help32/index.jsp?topic=/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.isv/guide/jdt_api_compile.htm
and there it is mentioned that a compliance level of 1.5 can have the source=1.4 and target=1.5

But in my case, compliance level is chosen as 1.4 by default.

 
I have attached build.xml with this entry and I used the following command to execute this build file in the command prompt.

ant -lib c:/tmp/lib

I copied the ecj compiler in c:/tmp/lib directory.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Get the build.xml file attached with this entry and paste it in C:/test
2. Copy the ecj.jar into C:/tmp/lib directory
3. In the command prompt (goto C:/test directory), execute the following command "ant -lib c:/tmp/lib"</description>

In html mode when using the alt+/ keyboard to autocomplete the writeln option
you get writeIn instead. writeIn is not a function supported by standard javascript.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create html document
2.Create script tags
3. Within the script write "document.w"
4. press alt+/ for content assist
5. Select writeln option (The only options should be write and writeln )</description>

      <title>pserver delays</title>
      <description>Hi,

since the last technical restructure of the CVS server infrastructure the pservers are not in sync with extssh access. There is also no easy way to tell how up-to-date pserver is.

While this was done to make extssh quicker (help committers) it creates a problem for contributers. It happened to us more than once that active contributors in our project where searching for fixes for bugs that only exists on contributers computers and not on committer computers and were due to the fact that pserver is several hours behind the committed code.

At the same time running automated builds and tests also now is error-prone since fixing a bug and running the build again sometimes works, sometimes we have to wait a few hours and try another build.

I know that you could make the build checkout using a committers userid and password, but I am not sure why I want my committers userid and password to be spread in scripts or property files. In my feeling it contradicts the idea that the userid identifies me as a person and make me personally responsible for changes in CVS.

Still it wouldnt help the contributors.

I am pretty unsatisfied with the number of disadvantages we experience with the pserver delays.

I would like to know why pserver cvs is several hours behind (and not only minutes or seconds)?

Would it be possible to have a status page either per CVS or for all CVSes what the last timestamp was that was synced to the pserver CVS copy ? Then at least when we commit something at 13:32 we had an easy way to check when that code is in the pserver copy.

At last not least, I would vote for reverting the change and put pserver and extssh back in sync. The time we lost in issues related to this in the past month is WAY MORE than time we lost in delayed CVS access in the time since Riena started 2 years ago.

thanks

      <title>[web connector] correct task summary gets garbled during refresh</title>
      <description>Scenario of our local repository: 
Use the web connector to connect to our repository that shows the list of bugs in a HTML table (param urlTaskQuery), but if you query detail data for a specific bug (param urlTask), the resulting web page does *not* have the headline of this bug in the &lt;title&gt; tag. In our case, the title of a detail page always shows something like "Details for bug AP00786567".

Refreshing the bug list works fine, this is using the table view and the queryPattern.
But whenever you refresh the bug data page, the correct summary line (in the Task List view) changes to the useless "Details for bug AP00786567".

Reason: In org.eclipse.mylyn.internal.web.tasks.WebRepositoryConnector.getTaskData(TaskRepository, String, IProgressMonitor), WebUtil.getTitleFromUrl() is used, and later in WebRepositoryConnector.updateTaskFromTaskData(TaskRepository, ITask, TaskData) the retrieved title is written to the task data. This makes sense *only* if the detail page shows the task summary in the title, which is not always the case.

Request: Make this call to getTitleFromUrl() optional, setting via a preference of the repository.

BTW: For our local needs I patched the code. If that helps, I can attach the patch. It's not for production, as it has no user option. It simply does not change the task summary on a refresh - hardcoded :-(</description>

      <description>Design and implement an animation system that allows certain aspects of a scene (figures, layers, camera) to be animated in a controlled manner. That means that an animation must have a defined timeframe and not be dependent on FPS. Sometimes, animation involves model changes, in such cases, the update manager must not trigger an immediate redraw, since the animation should take care of that. The user must be able to cancel an animation (for example a camera track) and regain control at any point in time. Changes performed by an animation must in such cases be rolled back.
GEF already supports animations, however more sophisticated concepts may be needed in 3D</description>

      <title>add support for highlighting figures</title>
      <description>Especially in larger 3D scenes, finding a figure can become extremely difficult. Highlighting figures, e., in order to visualize a search result, would be useful for many applications and should be implemented in the framework itself. In order to enable highlighting in a general manner, an infrastructure must be provided similar to selections.

Visualizing the highlighted figues:
One idea of highlighting is to simply draw a transparent colored cube around the bounding box of a figure.  Another idea would be to implement a spotlight-like mechanism: Instead of highlighting a figure, all other figures are dimmed. This could be achieved by implementing a proxy around the Graphics3D implementation which tweaks the setColor-methods. This is described in Bug 278351</description>

      <title>camera move in drag operations</title>
      <description>When dragging an element, currently the camera cannot be moved. A design (and implementation) on how to enable camera movement with the mouse button pressed is needed. Two possible ideas are:
- implement "hot edges", i.e. move the camera when the mouse cursor reaches an edge of the view
- implement "spring navigations", i.e. move (into the scene) when the mouse cursor hovers over a plane or figure in the back (question: how to get back)
Another alternative would be some sort of basket that can hold elements. It would work like this: Drag objects into the basket, move the camera, drag objects out of basket and onto target.</description>

      <title>remove restrictions related to 2D textures</title>
      <description>One tricky task would be to remove restrictions related to the old technique of projecting 2D content onto planes using textures. This technique is still available, Kristian implemented a kind of switch in the renderer functions in order to still support the old strategy. 

However, there were some "restrictions"  only related to the texture based projecting. E.g., at the moment, 2D connections can only connect two figures on the same plane. The DispatchingConnectionLayer is a result of this restriction and it could maybe implemented less restrective. As 2D figures are now rendered just like 3D figures, they are not restricted to be placed onto a surface anymore. OK, the surface is still necessary in order to calculate the 3D coordinate for a 2D figure, but it isn't required for rendering anymore!

Besides, already now we have to handle effects of 2D figures no longer to be restricted to a plane, e.g. when computing bounding boxes or when moving 2D figures outside a plane.</description>

      <title>support figure/diagram proxies</title>
      <description>One "visions" is to use GEF3D as an integrated modeling environment and support very large (3D) diagrams. Instead of fiddling around with configurations files or megamodels using tree based editors, transformation chains (or model chains) could be simply set up by dragging models (or their diagrams) onto a single GEF3D scene. The multi editor feature of GEF3D is already supporting this, actually in this context GEF3D provides more functionality then only 3D (multi editors and inter-model-connections are not only related to 3D! ).

One problem in this context would be the enormous amount of model elements and figures when all models of a larger project are to be visualized in a single 3D scene. For that reason, we have to support some kind of diagram proxies. That is, similar to level of detail (see 8) ), a diagram is rendered only as a simple (labeled) box, and its content is only visualized on (user) demand. The user should be able to load and unload (!) diagrams. Loading/unloading diagrams actually means (un)loading two things: the models and the GEF stuff (edit parts and figures). The first issue is EMF related, the second one may could be solved or at least supported by GEF3D. Maybe we have to talk to the GEF and GMF guys about that issue, as it may occurs on larger 2D diagrams, too. 

Remark: Unloading the models is not necessarily related to EMF, since GEF does not require the model to be EMF.

This feature certainly depends on level of detail techniques, in order to replace figures of a diagram with a single label.</description>

      <title>investigate in RAP/WebGL support</title>
      <description>Webapplications are becoming more and more important, and one technique is the Rich Ajax Platform (RAP). A prototype combining RAP with WebGL (an upcoming standard for using 3D in a browser) has already been implemented by a student in a master thesis I tutored. We should investigate further in this direction, since web applications become more and more important. A first step would be to at least enable GEF3D viewers embedded into a web application using WebGL. In this context, the two main issues are:
- extend RAP in order to support the GEF/Draw2D/3D API -- this probably is the hardest part
- implement a WebGL based Graphics3D implementation, shouldn't be too hard as WebGL is based on OpenGL ES 2.0</description>

Actually I tried to implement a prototype for that technique some time ago, unfortunately without success -- there are some problems hidden under the hood. This is why I think we should implement a very simple solution soon, in order to be prepared.</description>

But if i copy the jar file in plugins folder of the reportEngine folder, and run the same report from a application that uses this report engine, the rotatedLabel not appears. And there isn`t any log.

I attach my jar. BIRT version 2.3.2. 

I think that report engine doesn't load my jar.

Any idea?

i restarted X several times, even rebooted once, but the symptoms went away only after disabling folding again.

so far i've seen it only with the XSL outline, not sure if it is specific or may happen with others too.

      <title>declared "release" variable with no value set causes a stackoverflow exception in eclipse when the Release: tag references the variable.</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: M20090917-0800

When creating / editting a spec file in the spec file editor (text, not form), an "Unhandled event loop exception" occurs if a variable defined as "release" is created without a value and referenced by the Release entry. If the spec file is left open while eclipse is closed, eclipse will crash every time it is opened for as long as this syntax error is in place.

Will attach a stack trace and session data.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a spec file (general file or from template)
2. Set "Release:  %{release}"
3. At the top of the file, define release with no value - "%define release"
4. Move the cursor to the EOL of the %define line. 

sometimes a space + backspace will trigger the exception.</description>

      <description>Build Identifier: 20090920-1017

If you try to define a view placeholder in a perpective whose layout should be "closable=false" and "movable=false", views that are added by IWorkbenchPage.showView(...) later, are closable and movable.

Code:
IPerspectiveFactory.createInitialLayout(...) {
String oViewPlaceholderID = "myViewId:*";
folder.addPlaceholder(oViewPlaceholderID);
IViewLayout oViewLayout = layout.getViewLayout(oViewPlaceholderID);
oViewLayout.setCloseable(false);
oViewLayout.setMoveable(false);
}
----------------------------

Code somewhere else:

IWorkbenchWindow window = PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getActiveWorkbenchWindow();
window.getActivePage().showView("myViewId", "123", WorkbenchPage.VIEW_ACTIVATE);

This code adds a view that is closable and movable.

If there is a workaround. Please tell me!!!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make a new RCP application.
2. Define a perspective with a placeholder and a layout (@see detail description)
3. Open a view with viewId that matches the placeholder id. Outside of perpective factory. (@see detail description)
4. Start RCP application and move or close your view.</description>

      <description>Build Identifier: 3.5

Hi All,

We got this error on under certain conditions not always.
It seems the decorators got disabled and the reference was null and hence the error.But i am sure our code does not disable the decorator.
Would appreciate if some one could find out the problem?.
or can we have a decorator disablement check in the DecoratorManager code.

This error was called on this Decorator Manager API
public DecorationResult getDecorationResult(Object object) 


Please find the stack trace below

      <description>Created attachment 156784 [details]
Fix

Whether FormattedValueVMUtil.updateFormattedValuesWithAvailableFormats() sets the property IDebugVMConstants.PROP_FORMATTED_VALUE_ACTIVE_FORMAT_VALUE or not depends on the order of property keys provided by the set iterator.

E.g. if the property comes last, it will never be set.
As a consequence, the value column of an expression in the Expression view stays blank.

If you want to change the working directory of a run configuration to a subdirectory of the current working directory, the easiest would be, to copy&amp;paste the value of Default into Other and add the subdirectory.
Unfortunately the Default is greyed out and cannot be copyied.
Default should be made copyable.

      <title>Import Plug-ins wizard does not allow to add missing required plug-ins any more</title>
      <description>I20100119-0800

The behavior change mentioned in bug 18500 comment 53 kills our workspace update scenario:

&gt; There is a change in behaviour with this fix.  When the user imports a plug-in
&gt; with a conflict and chooses not to delete the project, previously we would skip
&gt; importing that plug-in.  After this fix, instead of ignoring, we import the
&gt; plug-in and give it a different name.

Before, we performed these steps when new plug-ins got added to a build:
- Import &gt; Plug-ins and F.
- select 'required by existing', as binary
- Select All
- When asked whether to replace existing, say 'No to All'

Now, we can only delete existing projects. If we deselect all in the "do you want to delete?" dialog, we get duplicate plug-ins in the workspace. But replacing existing plug-ins also fails because bug 300354 only imports one version.</description>

1. Contribute a button (or better to say a command) by using the menu contributions to a view toolbar.
2. Add handler programmatically for that command that disables itself (using the setBaseEnabled method when activated).
3. Add another button somewhere (maybe inside the view), that programmatically enables the above handler again (also by using the setBaseEnabled method of the above handler).
3. Move with the mouse pointer over the button in the toolbar. The button correctly gets that normal hover decoration.
4. If the button is clicked then it gets disabled.
5. When the mouse pointer leaves the disabled toolbar button and click the other button (the one of step 3) then the toolbar button is enabled again, but still has the hover decoration (although the mouse pointer isn't above that toolbar button anymore).

-&gt; wrong hover decoration of toolbar button.

Screenshot showing the error dialog

Build ID: I20091210-1301 (Eclipse 3.6m4) on WinXP

In my Workspace, I have two closed projects which I cannot delete any more: When I try to delete the project, no matter whether I choose to delete the underlying filestore, I get a dialog (see also attached):

Delete Resources
A fatal error occurred while performing the refactoring
Found problems:
No input element provided
No context information available
[back] [cancel]

As an end user, I am confused by this dialog because it talks about a refactoring (which I did not initiate, I wanted to delete a project!). It also gives me no indication how to resolve the problem.

I investigated the issue a little, and found that in the case of these two closed projects, the underlying location is displayed as 
   &lt;resource does not exist&gt;
in the project properties. I tried deliberately reproducing this case but could not; this state might have been initiated through my team provider (ClearCase Remote Client v7.1 Eclipse plugin), but I am not sure. The workspace was carried over from several older Eclipse versions. I can provide more data if needed.

Expected behavior: 
------------------
Deleting a project without the "Delete file system resources" switched on only unregisters the project from my workspace. This should always succeed regardless of whether the unerlying location exists or not. Furthermore, in case "delete file system" was chosen and the operation fails, the error dialog should be improved to not talk about a "refactoring" which is confusing for end users.

I'm marking the issue as "major" since there is no workaround for getting rid of the stale project.</description>

I accidentally opened a newer workspace (where I had written a CDT 7.0 team-shared index) with my older product (CDT 6.0.1).

Following was logged to the error log:
org.eclipse.core.runtime.CoreException: The team-shared index cannot be imported, its format is no longer supported.

The "no longer supported" is incorrect and confusing.

      <title>can not install test framework into sdk using p2</title>
      <description>using 
eclipse-SDK-I20100119-0800-win32

I unzipped the SDK, then unzipped the corresponding test framework in another directory. I added that test framework directory to "available software sites" and disabled all other sites. 

The install failed, saying: 

An error occurred while collecting items to be installed
session context was:(profile=SDKProfile, phase=org.eclipse.equinox.internal.p2.engine.phases.Collect, operand=, action=).
No repository found containing: osgi.bundle,org.apache.derby,10.1.2.1_v200803061811

So, that doesn't seem right. I think should be able to install without derby (or, for derby to be included). 

To work around this, I re-enabled the /releases/helios site. It did seem to eventually find a copy of derby to install, but then get a message in console about failing to unpack the derby...pack.gz file. But, did eventually ask me to restart workbench, so I assumed it installed something.</description>

      <title>"testUnWrapClass" in "test-spring-srg" failed on Spring 3.0 GA with Oracle DB</title>
      <description>This test is included org.eclipse.persistence.testing.tests.jpa.advanced.EntityManagerJUnitTestSuite. This is a new regression when we upgrading Spring framework from 2.5.6 to Spring 3.0 GA. The last passed result is from 2010-01-18. 

Currently from existing nightly results, the test failed on 2.0 and Main, I assume it will fail on 1.1.0 and 1.2 as well. The error message is:

      <description>Referring to:
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=287833#c10

We missed one case. This is not related to the same problem, but should be fixed as well.
public class X {
    /**
     * &lt;pre&gt;   {@code
     * 
     *   public class X {
     *   }}&lt;/pre&gt;
     */
    void foo() {}
}

which is both formatted with or without your patch as:
public class X02b {
    /**
     * &lt;pre&gt;
     * @code
     * 
     *   public class X {
     *   }}
     * &lt;/pre&gt;
     */
    void foo() {
    }
}

      <title>Virtual Resource API inconsistencies</title>
      <description>+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #296691 +++

I still think IResource#isVirtual() is wrong and I haven't heard a valid argument why it shouldn't be moved to IFolder (as explained in bug 296691 comment 3, it can be moved up to IResource if this becomes necessary in the future).

&gt; &gt; The API would also be easier to understand if you would explicitly state
&gt; &gt; that a virtual folder is a special linked folder. IResource#isLinked(int)
&gt; &gt; already returns true for virtual folders (although its API currently says
&gt; &gt; that links can only be created with createLink).
&gt; 
&gt; This is an implementation detail that virtual folders are implemented using
&gt; linked resources. This may change or can be hidden in a subsequent milestone.

The API of IResource#isLinked(int) is currently inconsistent, and that should be fixed. Even if you leave this unspecified, it would still break clients if you change virtual folders to not be linked folders in the future, so it would be better to specify this upfront.</description>

      <title>Allow full .app folder path in launcher name</title>
      <description>In the profile we keep the launcher name, for the mac I think it is best if we support the full .app path : "Eclipse.app/Contents/MacOS/eclipse"

This removes any ambiguity around trying to generate that path from a bare "eclipse".

This is particularly important when the name is something different: 
rcp.app/Contents/MacOS/rcp
Rcp.app/Contents/MacOS/rcp
EclipseTest.app/Contents/MacOS/eclipse (bug 299955)

Currently, in the eclipse touchpoint there is Util#getLauncherName(name, os),
in 3.4 this properly handled a full .app path, but a change was made in 3.5 which looks wrong to me.

I think we need to fix this in 3.5.2 because otherwise we can't update to metadata containing a full path which could make fixing other related bugs more difficult.</description>

      <title>remove WONTFIX test cases from jvmpi automated tests</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: 

There are a couple of cases in the JVMPI automated tests that refer to bugs currently in the WONTFIX state. These tests have been automatically marked failures in test passes since around the time of the original bug being logged.

We should remove theses cases from the test suites.

They are:
ArgumentsTest - https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=131786
GarbageCollectionTest - https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=133954
MultiThreadedTest - https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=147360

The last on is an intermittant failure on a case we still do execute. I have not seen it fail in a long time. Perhaps we can leave it but no longer fail it by default.

      <title>Base64 bug in PreferenceService#getByteArray</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: 20090920-1017

copied from newsgroup:
------------------------

I found a possible bug in the org.eclipse.core.internal.preferences.PreferencesService#getByteArray
method.

I think the bug is in line 512 of PrefereceService, where a "Base64.decode" is missing.
The method should look like this:

public byte[] getByteArray(String qualifier, String key, byte[] defaultValue, IScopeContext[] scopes) {
    String result =
        get(EclipsePreferences.decodePath(key)[1], null, getNodes(qualifier, key, scopes));
    return result == null ? defaultValue : Base64.decode(result.getBytes());
} 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
The following JUnit test fails:

@Test
public void putByteArray_DefaultScope() {
    final byte[] testArray = new byte[] { 10, 13, 15, 20 };
    DefaultScope defaultScope = new DefaultScope();
    defaultScope.getNode(TEST_NODE_PATH).putByteArray(TEST_PREF_KEY, testArray);
    final byte[] returnArray = Platform.getPreferencesService().
            getByteArray(TEST_NODE_PATH,TEST_PREF_KEY,new byte[] {}, null);
    Assert.assertArrayEquals(testArray, returnArray);

      <title>NPE during SVNTeamUIPlugin.start</title>
      <description>I am sometimes getting NPE like below during subclipse UI plugin activation. If this happens, the only way to get Subclipse UI is to restart Eclipse.

I debugged this a little and the root cause of the problem seems to be circular dependency between svn.core and svn.ui activation logic. At least in some activation scenarios svn.core bundle activator eagerly loads extensions from svn.ui plugin, which triggers svn.ui bundle activation, which assumes svn.core has already been activated. As a result, overall activation sequence works if it is started from svn.ui plugin and fails if started from svn.core plugin.

Similarly, the name of the schema file for this extension point, "org.carleton.scs.scheme.interpreter.exsd", shows even more of the history of this project. It too should be renamed to something along the lines of "org.eclipse.ide4edu.scheme.interpreter.exsd". The reference to this file in the plugin.xml also needs to be updated.</description>

      <title>BinaryResourceImpl mangles characters with code 128-255 during load</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: org.eclipse.emf 2.5.0.v200906151043

All characters between code 128 to 255 are not properly reloaded, e.g. German umlauts: ö,ä,ü.

Fix:

The method BinaryResourceImpl$EObjectInputStream.readString() uses 
---&gt;  this.characters[i] = (char) value;
to read a one byte-character back from the input stream. value is a byte variable. If byte is negative the resulting char will be -1, but originally written was 255.
Replacing the line with:
---&gt;     this.characters[i] = (char) ((value) &amp; (short)0xff);
will fix this problem, since the value is cast to short and masked before converting it to char.




Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Create a model with at least one string attribute and try to save and load an instance of it using the BinaryResourceImpl.
If any of the strings contains characters with code 128-255 the string will not be reloaded properly.</description>

In this session RSE crashed

I'm not exactly sure what is happening here. I'm editing some files on my server at home, and suddenly my Eclipse crashes. At some point RSE can't sync or list a file or folder contents. The process of doing so is pending in the background. Every action after this (save, refresh etc) gets me to a full crash where Eclipse won't respond to anything i do and i have to manually kill the process.

I can't really get much clearer then this. Sometimes i can work for hours without any crashes, sometimes i have crashes for every 2 files i'm trying to edit.

In the meanwhile my files are not saved or synced so I'm losing work here.

I am using 
* Eclipse 3.5.1 from the ubuntu repositories
* Ubuntu... (2.6.31-17, but had same with 16)
* RSE End-User Runtime	3.1.1.v200907301400
* java-6-openjdk

Today i've been so lucky (...) to have lots of crashes, so it was pretty easy to get a clean logfile. Attached file ([projectfolder]/.metadata/.log) was empty when i started the session, and this is whats left after i killed the process. However it doesn't look very informative for this particular problem. 

The logs in .metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.rse.* are empty. Are there any more places i can look?</description>

The selection behavior in the Breakpoints view looks broken.

Some scenarios:
1. click to select where text is ==&gt; only left side is selected
2. click to select right to the text ==&gt; again only left side is selected
3. just click again ==&gt; now I get full row selection

1. do some Ctrl+ click in the Breakpoints view

Add the following API to DynamicEntity:

  /**
   * Converts the value of the property identified by the specified property name
   * to the provided target class.
   * @param targetClass if the conversion is supported, the property value will 
   * be converted to this class.

   * @return the converted value of the specified property.
   * @see #get(String)
   */
  &lt;T&gt; T get(Class&lt;T&gt; targetClass, String propertyName);

Rationale:

Allow users easy access to the form in which they get data.  One common usage is the ability to get all data back in String format (useful when dealing with XML).</description>

      <title>Launching and Debug commands with exec path containing spaces</title>
      <description>For all the resource managers, after one has selected a communication interface, some default commands will be used to launch/debug a particular program. For Open MPI for instance, it would be of the form:

  ... ${Open_MPI_args} ${Open_MPI_env} ${execPath}/${execName} ${progArgs}

Unfortunately if one identify an executable with a path that contains spaces, the launching will fail, since the command will be misinterpreted.
A way to solve this would be to protect such path definition with the following command:

  ... ${Open_MPI_args} ${Open_MPI_env} "${execPath}/${execName}" ${progArgs}

Emmanuel.</description>

      <title>Validation of the issue number using bugtraq:logregex is broken</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: all

Subversive always use the first line of the property bugtraq:logregex to validate the issue number in the commit dialog. According:
http://tortoisesvn.net/docs/release/TortoiseSVN_en/tsvn-dug-bugtracker.html
Subversive should use the second line of bugtraq:logregex when there is two lines into that property.

In the source file:
src/org/eclipse/team/svn/ui/composite/CommentComposite.java
near line 190, the bugtraq:logregex property is used in a wrong manner:

this.validationManager.attachTo(this.bugIdText, new AbstractVerifier() {
  protected String getErrorMessage(Control input) {
    String logregex = CommentComposite.this.bugtraqModel.isNumber() ?
              "[0-9]+(,?[0-9]+)*" //$NON-NLS-1$
             : ((CommentComposite.this.bugtraqModel.getLogregex() != null) ?
                 CommentComposite.this.bugtraqModel.getLogregex()[0] : null);
    if (logregex != null) {
      String bugId = this.getText(input);
      if (bugId.length() &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; !bugId.matches(logregex)) {
        ...cut...
        return SVNUIMessages.format(
                   SVNUIMessages.CommentComposite_BugID_Verifier_Error_Text,
                   new String[] {
                       CommentComposite.this.bugtraqModel.getLabel(),
                       CommentComposite.this.bugtraqModel.getLogregex()[0] }
                   );
		}
	}
	return null;
}


CommentComposite.this.bugtraqModel.getLogregex()[1] should be used instead of CommentComposite.this.bugtraqModel.getLogregex()[0] when it exist.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Set your bugtraq:logregex to

\[Bug\s+(\d+)\]
(\d+)

and try to enter a number in the issue number text box of the commit dialog. You will get a validation error.</description>

      <description>Draw2D suffers from GDI+ painting performance with anti-alias enabled. In particular the performance degrades when dash-lines are painted.
Draw2D solution for this problem would be paint without anti-alias and then when UI thread is free paint the same thing again with anti-alias. This solution is overly-complicated and doesn't fit well in the current framework.

Given that OpenGL 3-rd party Java bindings: LWJGL and JOGL can't be part of Orbit, because of the IP test failures, Draw2D would be interested in faster SWT rendering at least on Windows 7.</description>

      <title>API tooling warnings being suppressed unexpectedly</title>
      <description>It took me a while to narrow this down to a small set of reproducible steps. It all started when some API tooling warnings that I know where in the code unexpectedly disappeared on me and then suddenly reappeared. Many hours of troubleshooting led me to a scenario that seems 100% reproducible.

Using Eclipse 3.6M4
1. Create a new workspace
2. Set the workspace's API baseline. This step is not necessary but will let us avoid a distracting, unrelated warning.
3. Extract the attached projects.zip to the workspace directory.
4. Import the projects via File &gt; Import &gt; General &gt; Existing Project into Workspace
5. Wait till the projects finish building
6. Note there are no warnings in 'testproject'. This is the bug. There should be an API warning. We can all of a sudden make the warning appear.
7. Open Whatever.java in the editor. Change the file in a pointless way--e.g., add a newline at the end. Save the file.
All of a sudden you'll see the API tooling report a warning for Whatever.foo().

Note the project has a .settings/.api_filters file which references a non-existent resource. That should NOT result in unrelated API warnings being suppressed, which is what's happening.

Note, too, that the broken behavior seems very fragile. Seemingly unrelated changes to the project can make the problematic behavior go away. For example, removing 'testproject's dependency on the core-cdt project hides the problem. It makes no sense. There's something squirrely going one, but as long as you have a 100% reproducible case, you should be able to get to the bottom of it. The above steps are 100% reproducible for me.</description>

Per the specs, getEnclosedElements should return items in source order. However, it seems to return them in alphabetical order.

I'm making an annotation where method parameters in a generated class are based on the source order of the annotated class. This is what would make the most sense to the user. Alphabetical is at least deterministic, but source order is preferable.

http://download.java.net/jdk7/docs/api/javax/lang/model/element/TypeElement.html

(Also, will debugging, I'm pretty sure I noticed getAllMembers uses hash maps internally and so will result in non-deterministic ordering. I was originally using getAllMembers and so I suspected it to be the culprit. However, removing it is still sorting orders alphabetically. I'd like to use getAllMembers if it would also respect source order--perhaps base class items first, source order, then sub class items next, also source order.)

javac does return source order, which makes building cross-compiler annotation processors more complicated. I'll have to re-sort on own, most likely alphabetically since that is all I can do, so that both Eclipse and javac output is the same.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make a source class with two fields bFoo first and aFoo second.
2. Make an annotation processor that calls getEnclosedElements and the order is aFoo then bFoo.</description>

      <title>[target] New proposed target API breaks API tools</title>
      <description>I20100121-0800

Helping test the new API from the branch, I found a few places that the current state of the branch breaks API tools. In our baseline and API use code when building the bundle collection we use IResolvedBundle to get at the BundleInfo and to know if a bundle is a source bundle or not and to get the location information. 

In the API branch this type has been removed, and updating our code to use the "new world" i.e. ITargetDefinition.getProvisionedBundles(), does not allow us to know if any of the bundles are source bundles or not.

Affected API tools classes:

      <description>Build Identifier: I20100115-1100

The test suite name will be cached even though the whole project which contains this test suite has been deleted from the disk

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Bring up the eclipse in a empty workspace. 
2.Import TestProject.zip. Open editor for JUnitTest test suite. In the editor, rename it to MyJUnitTest. Save it. You will see the name in the resource view of test navigator looks like "MyJUnitTest [JUnitTest] &lt;Time Stamp&gt;".Delete the whole project from the disk.
3.Import the TestProject.zip again.You will find the test suite name in resource view of test navigator is still "MyJUnitTest [JUnitTest] &lt;Time Stamp&gt;" instead of the original "JUnitTest &lt;Time Stamp&gt;"</description>

-----Original Message-----

Subject: Re: [cdt-dev] Getting GDB error message in DSF-GDB

It would be nice if we could take it a step further--if the GDB plugin could produce specialized exceptions based on the message, so that handlers further up the call chain could check for specific errors without having to do that parsing. Basically, the knowledge of what messages to expect from a particular gdb would be maintained at the lower levels of the solution, as that is where such backend-specific knowledge belongs. This would help us address issues like https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=288305 in a cleaner way.

	Hi,
	 
	using DSF-GDB, does anyone know of a good way to have access to the GDB error message when an MI command fails?
	From what I see, we include the error message within a string that says:
	 
	Failed to execute MI command:
	-trace-define-variable marc
	Error message from debugger back end:
	Name of trace variable should start with '$'
	 
	I just want the last line, so as to show it to the user in an error line.
	 
	In AbstractMIControl, this full string is passed back to the requestMonitor as a Status with
	the full string as the Status message.
	 
	Of course I could parse this string, but that doesn't seem very elegant.
	I don't want to change the format of the string because I don't want to do all
	the regression tests that come with it.
	 
	My thought is to create an Exception and put the backend message in there,
	and then to pass that Exception in the Status (since right now, no Exception is passed).
	 
	If anyone has a better idea, let me know.
	 
	Thanks

This problem can be solved by manually refreshing the workspace / or the affected resource.

Would it be possible to add the functionality in search that if search find such a problem that is automatically refresh the affected resource?

      <description>CCS 4 supports a path mapping feature (under preferences -&gt; C/C++ -&gt; debug -&gt; Common Source Lookup) which allows TISB users to map Linux paths to Windows drives, e.g. /db/vtree -&gt; V:. This is used to aid in source lookup when debugging.

ROV and RTA should also look at these mappings to help it locate the ROV recap and RTA XML files. 

The ROV core cannot have a dependency on this tool, so the process of locating the recap file needs to be abstracted out in a way that would allow the CCS plugins to provide code for locating the files.</description>

On the project attribute the defaults should be:

Join column default name -                           "employees_id"

Inverse join column default name -                   "projects_projId"
Inverse join column default referenced column name   "projId


Currently the incorrect behavior is that join column default name is "Employee_id".  This would be the case if it was not a bidirectional mapping.</description>

      <description>I20100121-0800

Steps

1. set grouping in the breakpoints view to be by breakpoint type
2. add a class load and method breakpoint to a Java class (for example)
3. select all breakpoints and groups in the view (Ctrl + A)
4. hit the delete key
5. press "No" in the resulting dialog asking to delete all breakpoints in the selected containers
6. watch as all of your breakpoints get deleted

If however at step 4 you press the remove all breakpoints view action and press "No" in the resulting dialog nothing happens - your breakpoints will not be deleted.

I would expect the response to the dialog to be the same regardless of where it is used - in this case I would expect it to do nothing pressing the delete key when I press "No".</description>

      <title>[performance] Some inner classes should be static inner classes</title>
      <description>There are several inner classes that should be made static for performance reasons.  This can reduce the sizes of the classes and help free them sooner for grabage collection.  I'll attach a patch to address this.</description>

      <title>Creating remote directory with spaces should not end up with backslash in final name</title>
      <description>If one uses RemoteToolsFileStore.mkdir("/tmp/my path"), then it will end up with the following directory name on the target machine:
  /tmp/my\ path

We should not end up with having the directory name including the backslash character.
The problem seems to occur in PathTools.quote method.

      <title>Predicate.getExpressions() doesn't return the right result</title>
      <description>It seems to return different answers depending upon the number of actual expressions in the predicate. For example, with the following:

Predicate criteria = cb.conjunction();
if (name != null) {
  ParameterExpression&lt;String&gt; p = cb.parameter(String.class, "name");
  criteria = cb.and(criteria, cb.equal(emp.get("name"), p));
}
if (deptName != null) {
  ParameterExpression&lt;String&gt; p = cb.parameter(String.class, " 
  criteria = cb.and(criteria, cb.equal(emp.get("dept").get("name"), p));
}
if (projectName != null) {
  ParameterExpression&lt;String&gt; p = cb.parameter(String.class, "project");
  criteria = cb.and(criteria, cb.equal(project.get("name"), p));
}
if (city != null) {
  ParameterExpression&lt;String&gt; p = cb.parameter(String.class, "city");
  criteria = cb.and(criteria, cb.equal(emp.get("address").get("city"), p));
}
System.out.println("Expression count: " + criteria.getExpressions().size());

If one of the four is not null then the size will be 0.
If two or more are not null then the size will always be 2.

The spec defines getExpressions() to return the "top-level conjuncts", so there is certainly a good argument for saying that successive "and"s is always going to produce a binary set of top-level conjuncts, but the 0 part is an error, I think.</description>

      <description>Running I20100119-0800.
Tried to update to I20100121-0800.

Problem #1
The update wizard starts on page 2 and assumes I want to update everything. I _really_ don't want that. I only want to update the SDK so I have to press '&lt; Back', unselect all the stuff I don't want to update, then press 'Next &gt;' to get back to where the wizard started, but with the correct list.

Problem #2
Once I've fixed the list of items to update. I can't update them anyway.
This is the exception that I get.

field resolution

I20100121-0800

When our reference extractor handles field references it does not correctly report references to fields from the class hierarchy- for example setting / getting a field value from a parent class.

I our current state we always consider field get / set instructions to belong to the type that the reference appears in. We should be resolving field get / set to make sure they are talking about the correct field.

The patch provides field resolution for class hierarchies, but I have not tested it to see if it will properly resolve the owning class for a field reference in an inner type where the field comes from the hierarchy of the enclosing type.</description>

      <title>[find/replace] Find / Replace causes rendering corruption when replacing \n.</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: 20090920-1017

Using the Find / Replace dialog to replace text using \n as the regex causes unexpected results.

Additionally:
The caret regex should match the beginning of each line, without needing to match an additional character.  It needs to work the same way sed does:

  eg: printf "foo\nbar\nbaz" | sed 's#^#SSS#g'

Currently, the Caret operator in Find/Replace needs an additional regex symbol (eg:.?) in order to function.  




Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Find: \n
2.Replace with: \nfoobar
3.tic "Regular Expression"
4.hit "Replace" button</description>

      <description>This was reported (and demonstrated over shoulder) by a user on Galileo with the 2.2 release from xqdt.org.  I belive it to be fixed, as I'm not able to reproduce it on the eclipse.org codebase.  I'm logging it so that at some point we can go back and reproduce it, understand the problem, and confirm with authority that it is fixed.

Occurs when opening a new editor window from an open xquery module tab.

      <title>Agent service lifecycle problems</title>
      <description>I20100121

We still rely on the start() and stop() methods in various p2 bundles to do initialization and cleanup. Most of this work should be moved into agent lifecycle methods instead, since the lifecycle of a p2 agent does not necessarily match the lifecycle of the bundles providing the agent services (although it happens to be true in the SDK case for the agent of the currently running system).</description>

      <title>[Actions]  Deadlock occurs when flushing redo stack on diagram during a modal action</title>
      <description>Created attachment 156886 [details]
patch

While ModalContext thread is running, calling thread flushes async display messages. (UI thread == main thread). If redo stack is flashed from the ModalContext thread then if there are actions updated asynchronously and some synchronously, then the async updates would happen on the caller thread at the same time as sync updates on the ModalContext thread.

When Eclipse's UndoActionHandler is refreshed, it is being refreshed asynchronously and it requires undo-redo lock from the operation history object. The lock however is owned by the ModalContext thread for flushing redo stack. Therefore, undo action handler's refresh is blocked until redo stack is flushing completes.

Redo stack flushing cannot complete because GMF AbstractContributionItem can listen to operation history and do an update of the action synchronously, which cannot be done because it is blocked by the main thread flushing scheduled async messages, in this particular case, the undo action handler blocked by the undo-redo lock on operation history.

GMF should schedule action updates on the UI thread instead of running them right away.</description>

      <title>[ui] help&gt;check for updates should open on first page of wizard</title>
      <description>From bug 300445:

&gt; The update wizard starts on page 2 and assumes I want to update everything. I
&gt; _really_ don't want that. I only want to update the SDK so I have to press '&lt;
&gt; Back', unselect all the stuff I don't want to update, then press 'Next &gt;' to
&gt; get back to where the wizard started, but with the correct list.

The assumption we've had is that most users want to update everything to the latest version most of the time, and we are saving those users a step.   

There's some discussion in bug 268166 about having more preferences that would let you say which updates you care about in general (or which you don't care about).  That might solve the problem.

Lacking that, we could consider a generic preference controlling which page you land on in the update wizard.  (the code is already set up with a flag for this, we just don't use it right now).  We previously had bugs saying "why do I have to click next when 99% of the time I just want the latest of everything?"</description>

      <title>Finish button in New Project wizard is enabled even if JSF facet does not have library information</title>
      <description>Build Identifier:  I20100119-0800

The Finish button in the New Project wizard is enabled even if JSF facet does not have library information, which leads to errant and inconsistent behavior.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
* In a new workspace, open the File &gt; New &gt; Dynamic Web Project wizard
* Enter a project name and target runtime
* From the Configuration dropdown, select "JavaServer Faces v1.2 project"

Expected Results:
The Finish button should be disabled, as the JSF facet does not have any information about the JSF libraries. (Also see note on inconsistent behavior below)

Actual Results:
The Finish button is enabled. When one clicks on it, the JSF project is created, but the JSF taglibs are not available etc.

Notes:

* After the "Steps to Reproduce" above, if you click on the "Next" button till you arrive at the "JSF Capabilities" page, you will see that the Finish button is disabled on that page now.

* At this point if one clicks on the Back button till you arrive at the "Dynamic Web Project" wizard page, one can see that the "Finish" button is disabled, which is inconsistent (it was enabled the first time).</description>

      <title>[content assist] Overwrite mode does not replace existing characters fully when new chars are added and caret is moved</title>
      <description>I20100119-0800

void m(String s) {
        s.endsWth(s);
    }

- enable Java &gt; Editor &gt; Content Assist &gt; Completion overwrites
- set caret after 's.e'
- Ctrl+Space

a) type 'n' and move caret back by one char (back to after 's.e'), hit 'Enter'
===&gt; the whole word after 'e' is highlighted and replaced by the selected proposal as expected.

b) instead of (a) type 'q' and move caret back by one char (back to after 's.e'), hit 'Enter'
===&gt; one char from the end is left out. Each time this is repeated one char from the end of the word is left out from highlighting and when you hit 'Enter', the characters at the end are not replaced.

After typing 'q' and moving back the caret 2 times and then hitting 'Enter' on endsWith(..) proposal we see : 
       s.endsWithth(s);

==&gt; Expected: All the characters are highlighted and replaced on selecting a proposal from the list.
       s.endsWith(s);

This scenario seems to occur whenever a proposal gets added at the top of list as a result of moving back the caret. It does not occur when 'n' is typed in the example, since the 2 extra proposals(equals*(..) ) get added at the bottom whereas when 'q' is typed, endsWith(..) gets added at the top of the list. Another example where this happens:
void m() {
       s.chaAt(0); 

}
If you type 'h' and move the caret, works fine but if you type 'o' and move caret back chars are left out from highlighting from the end.</description>

      <title>semantic highlighting of functions with default argument</title>
      <description>I have semantic highlighting enabled and set distinguishable color of code-&gt;problem item.
Under circumstances described below call of function with default argument,
where not all arguments are supplied (i.e. default is used), highlighted as a problem.

Here is setup:
file 'test.hpp':
void test(int x,bool y=true);

file 'test.cpp':
#include "test.hpp"

void test(int x,bool y)
{

}

file 'func.cpp':
#include "test.hpp"
void func()
{
  test(1);
}

However "jump to definition" works fine, and jumps to correct function.
If function with default arguments and call site are in the same translation unit, it's colored as expected.</description>

AbstractOpenWizardWorkbenchAction and AbstractOpenWizardAction of org.eclipse.jst.j2ee.ui is independent of J2EE context.Ideally they should be in a non jst plugin. They can be moved to org.eclipse.wst.common.frameworks.ui and can be deprecated in org.eclipse.jst.j2ee.ui.Attaching a CVS patch (created on head)for the enhancement.

      <title>Provide capability to remove the invalid default instance of a driver template</title>
      <description>An extension of the org.eclipse.datatools.connectivity.driverExtension extension point may define a driver template with a defaultDefinitionName.  A corresponding default driver definition will then get automatically created, but only if none was previously created.   
However, the default driver definition may become invalid over time, e.g. its jar file path got moved.  But since the default driver definition was created automatically, an application user may not be aware of its existence and does not know to manually fix its jar path.

This enhancement is to provide the API capability to remove an invalid default driver definition.  A client application may use it to do clean up, and can then trigger the automatic creation of a new up-to-date default driver definition.</description>

      <title>Cascade Delete logic implemented in wrong place</title>
      <description>The logic for cascade delete is implemented in :

The ui plugin - inside TSDeleteAction
the visualeditor - inside TSRemoveFromModelAction.

This means that deletes done from the API will never be cascade deleted.

The logic should be moved to the base plugin, whoich will also mean that the preference that contrrols this should alos be moved to the base plugin.

The existing (non functioning) preference has been disabled - see 298971.</description>

Test Case

This is action with 2-step shortcut (Ctrl+G,R). If the key assist dialog appears, the action will not be triggered. 

It works fine on Windows, but not on Ubuntu nor Solaris.

It is reproducible on 3.5.1 and 3.6.

After enabling command tracing, handlers are not computed if the key assist dialog appears.</description>

      <title>In Module Assembly wizard, too many references are displayed</title>
      <description>Created attachment 156912 [details]
Showing references that shouldn't exist. 

The module assembly page, as of right now, is a thin view of the component.xml file. In a workspace which contains 1 ear and 2 ejb's (all connected to each other), the properties page currently shows one ejb to be bundled inside the other.

This is incorrect and the component.xml shows no such thing. This is due to J2EEModuleVirtualComponent.getReferences() returning references that are not "hard" references. This should be fixed. 

Also, the wizard is showing a reference to a jar in the parent Ear project, which clearly does not need to be shown here.</description>

      <title>SQL Server functions are not supported in SQL Query Builder</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: 20090920-1017

In Birt SQL Query builder, When I use the SQL server data source and enter a query with built in functions it is not supporting and says error message.

For example, if I use the below query in SQL query builder,

SELECT LEFT('ABCDEFGH', 2)

BIRT says an error message "SQL syntax is wrong or is not currently supported. Some SQL builder functions have been disabled. To enable these functions change the syntax."

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a new data set
2. Select SQL Server data source
3. Enter a query with built in function/customised functions</description>

      <title>[Dialogs] [JFace] Provide accessor for dialog messages</title>
      <description>It would be nice to have access to the Dialog messages (eg. IDialogConstants.OK_LABEL) trough API instead of a field access. This would allow the RAP team to provide a session-based translation for the labels and furthermore improves the usability for our current users.
Developers who want to single-source their applications for RCP and RAP cannot use the existing API of JFace as the labels are hardcoded as static fields and RAP has no chance to intervene this behavior without breaking API.
I suggest to provide an accessor like SWT.getMessage() to get the translated string as this would allow developers to use the same API in RCP and JFace.
I'd be happy to provide a patch once we decided on a possible approach. As suggested above, I'd introduce an accessor on Dialog itself and introduce message keys in IDialogConstants.</description>

Dear Jetty development team,

First of all, thank you for this tool. Jetty is my preferred server, for development and production. Together with the maven jetty plugin, life is a joy.

But it doesn't mean that it can't be better. I've come to know the play framework (www.playframework.org) which does not compare with Jetty, since are different tools, but the play framework has a really interesting development model, I don't know exactly how (the framework developer claims it uses eclipse compiler behind scenes) but you start the web server and don't stop it anymore. Refreshs are light speed fast.

Anyway, I just though this could be some thing interesting to Jetty.

Thank you again.

Best regards,
Samuel.

      <description>Build Identifier: 

When using the "splash login view" (http://wiki.eclipse.org/Riena_Login_support#Provide_own_splash_login_view), there is no indication in the task bar that the Riena app is running.

While this may consistent with what splash screens are originally for (something shown *before* the actual application is actually available for use), it's bad in terms of usability.

Use case: Launch the Riena app -&gt; switch to another application -&gt; forget about the launched Riena app... You will only "remember" that you launched the Riena app when you minimize or close the other active windows covering the splash login view.

      <title>unidirectional one-to-many relationship with compound key and join table fails</title>
      <description>In the testuite eclipselink.jpa.wdf.test, the tests  

org.eclipse.persistence.testing.tests.wdf.jpa1.relation.TestMap.testOffice and
org.eclipse.persistence.testing.tests.wdf.jpa1.relation.TestMap.testEmptyOffice

fail.

They test a unidirectional relationship between Office and Cubicle:

@Entity
@Table(name = "TMP_OFFICE")
public class Office {

...

   @OneToMany
    @JoinTable(name = "TMP_OFFICE_CUBICLE", joinColumns = { @JoinColumn(name = "OFFICE_ID") }, inverseJoinColumns = {
            @JoinColumn(name = "CUBICLE_FLOOR", referencedColumnName = "FLOOR"),
            @JoinColumn(name = "CUBICLE_PLACE", referencedColumnName = "PLACE") })
    public Map&lt;CubiclePrimaryKeyClass, Cubicle&gt; getCubicles() {
        return m_cubicles;
    }
}


The test fails with the following exception:

There is no column "TMP_OFFICE.CUBICLES_KEY". moreover, the mapping uses a join table. Things are going completely wrong.

The test is currently disabled. To reproduce this issue, set the property 

test.bugzilla.run=300337

      <title>[Cocoa] System beep (bong) when giving focus to a GMF editor</title>
      <description>Created attachment 156931 [details]
Beep stack

We are using GMF under MacOSX/Cocoa. When giving the focus from another view to a GMF editor, we here a system beep ("bong").
We get this strange behavior with our editor (cf www.bonitasoft.com), and we could reproduce it in an Eclipse SKK with the STP-BPMN editor.

You can find attached the stack of methods that ends with a Display.beep().

This beep is due to the fact that, on Cocoa, giving focus to a GMF editor refreshes the zoom combobox in toolbar, and this refresh causes an exception, which is caught and user is warned with a "bong".
Then I don't know who is really the culprit between GMF, GEF and SWT...

This is Cocoa specific: the same manipulation works well with Windows, Linux, and Carbon.

The workaround we used is to remove the zoomContribution on our editors.</description>

Hi,

You can find in the attachments an archive containing an example plug-in and its corresponding test plug-in.

This example plug-in contains an example of MoDisco browser customization dedicated to the JDK and Eclipse classes. This example has been presented at ESE 2009.

The contributors of the plug-ins are:
 - Grégoire Dupé (committer)
 - Nicolas Guyomar (not committer)

      <title>Expression has not been initilaized correctly when executing correct query</title>
      <description>In the testsuite eclipselink.jpa.wdf.test, some tests 

org.eclipse.persistence.testing.tests.wdf.jpa1.query.TestConditionalExrpession.testMeberOfHandling* fail when creating the following valid queries:

"select cri from Criminal cri, City c where cri.attachedCop member of c.cops"
"select cri from Criminal cri, City c where cri member c.criminals"

Strangely the negated queries pass fine:

"select cri from Criminal cri, City c where cri.attachedCop not member of c.cops"
"select cri from Criminal cri, City c where cri not member c.criminals"

The failing queries produce the following stack trace:

      <title>[JUnit] Use of require-bundle for org.junit</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: M20090211-1700

The test plugin org.eclipse.jdt.junit.runtime should
not get its JUnit dependency via Require-Bundle, but by using
Import-Package. Require-Bundle is acceptable for *eclipse*-bundles, but should
not be used for JUnit, which can also be retrieved from other places (e.g.
SpringSource Repository) and then have a different bundle symbolic name.

      <title>Cannot create working branches in ATS except at root</title>
      <description>In OSEE 0.9.0, a restriction has been added in ATS that working branches cannot be created from working branches (which is not unreasonable). The parent branch for the version needs to be a baseline.

However, it seems that the only branches that are considered to be baseline branches are those with no parent.

This prevents parallel development of different projects using the same product line (which is our use case, and the example used in the OSEE tutorial).

Is there an undocumented option to change what defines a baseline branch or is this a bug in the code?</description>

      <title>Too large description creates automatic window/View resize and horizontal scrolling bar</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: M20080221-1800

Quand il y a beaucoup de texte, la zone Description de l'onglet Properties s'ajuste à la phrase de plus grande longueur. Ce qui provoque la création d'un ascenseur horizontal. Ce n'est vraiment pas pratique.

Quelque soit le texte affiché, il ne faut pas qu'il y ait un ascenseur. Tout le texte doit tenir dans la largeur de l'onglet (qui est d'ailleurs conditionné par la largeur de la fenêtre MelodyAdvance).

L'horizontal scroll bar devrait être automatiquement positionnée dans le cas de longue chaine dans les "text field" (champ "names" par exemple) et un retour à la ligne pour les text Area (champ "Description" par exemple).


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Taper du texte dans les champs description (text area) et nom (text field)</description>

      <title>[backend] add java method pointcut test</title>
      <description>The functionality to advise functions is implemented (and works for b3 functions at least).
Tests are needed to test advised java methods, the tests should cover:
- advise modifies an input parameter (the java method should get the modified value on proceed)
- advise modifies a varargs value (- " -)
- advice replaces the entire varargs array (- " -)

Look at testFunctionCrossCuts.b3 for similar tests for b3 function.

Suggest writing a Java class with suitable methods to use for testing.</description>

      <title>[UI] Clean up label provider implementations</title>
      <description>Currently, the hierarchy of label providers in Xtext is quite large and a bit unclear. Into the bargain, the naming is not very helpful, e.g. what is the difference between DefaultLabelProvider and SimpleLabelProvider?

We have multiple (orthogonal) features, which are not clearly separated:

0) Base functionality (JFace LabelProvider)  
1) Image loading infrastructure
2) Delegation to EMF AdapterFactory 
3) Styled text labels
4) Polymorphic dispatch of image() and text()

I'd suggest to have 
a) an AbstractLabelProvider implementing 1) and 2) 
b) a subclass StyledLabelProvder containing all code related to styled text
c) with another subclass DeclarativeStyledLabelProvider.</description>

      <title>not-yet-loaded collection not copied properly from entity to another</title>
      <description>I have to entities "Employee" that have a set of projects. Projects are loaded lazily.

I atempt top copy the projects from one employee to another:

Employee hans = em.find(Employee.class, HANS_ID);
Employee fred = em.find(Employee.class, FRED_ID);
fred.setProjects(hans.getProjects());
em.getTransaction().commit();

Upon commit, eclipselink does not reflect the change on the database. I assume the change is ignored as hans.getProjects() was a pending collection before the change and is a pending pending collection after the change. But EclipseLink should detect that the owner of the pending collection has changed.

The issue is reproduced by test 

org.eclipse.persistence.testing.tests.wdf.jpa1.relation.TestBidirectionalManyToMany

      <title>Italian messages not found (no useful fallback).</title>
      <description>Essentially all strings (labels and the like) are replaced by:

NLS missing message: XxxPropertyEditionPart_YyyLabel in it.condarelli.rcp.writer.model.world.providers.worldMessages

I assume I have to do something about internationalization, but I don't know what (unless I have just to do the normal string editing (Externakize Strings Wizard)).

I also have a bunch of (possibly related) errors on the console:

...
ENTRY org.eclipse.osgi 2 1 2010-01-21 17:41:20.203
!MESSAGE NLS missing message: PropertiesEditionPart_AddListViewerLabel in: it.condarelli.rcp.writer.model.world.providers.worldMessages

!ENTRY org.eclipse.osgi 2 1 2010-01-21 17:41:20.203
!MESSAGE NLS missing message: PropertiesEditionPart_RemoveListViewerLabel in: it.condarelli.rcp.writer.model.world.providers.worldMessages

 This bunch of errors come from the fact I have an Italian locale on my PC, so I understand I have o copy worldMessages.properties to worldMessages_it.properties and, possibly, edit it.

I did that and now I have my labels as they should.

I see this as a bug: If the correct locale is not found EEF should fall-back to the "neutral"(English) file.

About this Stéphane Bouchet said:
   Yes, because there is actually 3 properties files. one english, one french and one default ( same as english ). EEF should display the default one if it not find the italian :)

   We will also move to BABEL to internationalize EEF, i you would like to help for italian internationalization.

This is something I would expect and I surely can live with.
Unfortunately this is not what happens in my case:
I see only two files xxxMessages.properties and xxxMessages_fr.properties (no xxxMessages_en.properties!!) *AND* my output is completely garbled (no labels) unless I provide an xxxMessages_it.properties (no fallback).

If required I can attach my whole project.</description>

      <title>Republish removes the files from the server</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: I20100119-0800

When republishing a project it gets removed from the server instead of updating the file.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create a new dynamic web project and a jsp file.
2.Start a server and add the project to it. 
3.Make a change on the jsp file and run it on the server.
4.The server will say it republished but the web browser will return a 404 error.
5.Viewing the wtpwebapps/project folder shows no files in it anymore.</description>

      <title>Add FUNCTION support to extended JPQL</title>
      <description>In order to allow developers to use database functions in their criteria specified queries JPA 2.0 introduced CriteriaBuilder.function method. This enhancement will add comparable functionality into EclipseLink JPQL. The goal is to address custom database operators and common functions not supported by JPQL.

Potential SYNTAX:

FUNCTION('SDO_WITHIN_DISTANCE, :GEOM1, :GEOM2, 'distance = 1000') = 'TRUE'

Additional items to consider in this feature:
- using platform registered ExpressionOperator by name
- stored functions</description>

      <title>Statistcal model loader adds CounterDescriptors to model before setting name attribute</title>
      <description>This is not a functional defect, but rather a performance enhancement.

Consuming products key off of descriptor and counter descriptor names to perform realtime analysis and aggregation of statistical data.  When counter descriptors arrive in the model without names (which happens for all counter descriptors but for no descriptors), we must register a listener to wait for the name to be assigned before we can process it.  In the case of very large workflows, this can result in the unnecessary creation, firing, processing and garbage collecting of millions of unnecessary adapter objects.  In very extreme cases, we can exhaust the heap simply by pushing too many counter descriptors into the model and being unable to keep up with the garbage collection of all the adapters.  If the model loader sets the name before adding the counter descriptor to the model, none of these objects needs to even be created, resulting in a substantial performance and memory utilization improvement.

I'll attach a patch for further discussion and review.</description>

      <title>Refactor graphics API</title>
      <description>Currently, the Graphics API (Graphics3D, Graphics3DDraw etc) is very messy. It mixes concerns and abstraction levels. Some of the functions are high level and some are low level, some abstract from the OpenGL API and some don't. This needs to be cleaned up. We need to choose one level of abstraction and define a new API based on that. Also we need to define whether we want to use the Graphics API for things like export because this may have an impact on the level of abstraction possible with such an API. Also there needs to be a more low level API that encapsulates from the OpenGL layer if we want to be able to support different OpenGL layers (JOGL, LWJGL etc).</description>

      <title>preserve indentation when substituting a multi-line string in a template file</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: 

Example:

% var function_body = "printf(\"hello world!\");\nreturn 0;";
int main() {
    `function_body`
}

... currently produces this:

int main() {
    printf("hello world!");
return 0;
}

... instead of this:

int main() {
    printf("hello world!");
    return 0;
}

Ideally, I would like this to be a standard templating feature, but it could also be added as a function (e.g. something like xdc.applyIndent(&lt;&lt;String&gt;&gt;)) if there is some case where auto-indent may not be desired.

I have implemented a similar scheme for a personal project.  I'll include some info about my old implementation as an attachment.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:

      <description>I20100121-0800.

Currently when we introduce a new setting (e.g. JDT Core problem) and the project is configured to use project specific settings, it uses the value as configured in the workspace because the new setting is not stored yet.

We should check for new settings (e.g. by attaching ourselves to the builder) and generate a problem on the project that informs about this. Of course this would come along with a quick fix.

The nice side-effect of this is that we can use it to advertise new settings through this mechanism.</description>

      <description>Build Identifier: Eclipse 3.6 I20100115-1100

The RCP application Bootstrap.product when exported from org.eclipse.equinox.p2.reconciler.dropins plugin does not install using org.eclipse.equinox.p2.director application. The Bootstrap.product when exported and installed from Eclipse 3.6 M4 works fine, the problem shows up from about the I20100115-1100 build.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download eclipse sdk 3.6 I20100115-1100.
2. Export Bootstrap.product from the org.eclipse.equinox.p2.reconciler.dropins plugin. Check the generate metadata option while exporting the product.
3. Use the org.eclipse.equinox.p2.director to install with the following program args -
-flavor tooling -profile bootProfile -destination &lt;dest&gt; -installIU org.eclipse.equinox.p2.reconciler.dropins.product -metadataRepository &lt;repositoryURL&gt; -artifactRepository &lt;repositoryURL&gt;  -p2.os win32  -p2.ws win32 -p2.arch x86

      <description>Using CTRL+C or CTRL+INS on a Text control (SWT) does not perform the clipboard copy operation. Note that this occurs on Text controls that are shown in a workspace view or editor (text controls shown on wizards/dialog boxes behave properly). Cut and Paste keyboard shorcuts work fine. Unbinding the copy command in the "Preferences" -&gt; "General" -&gt; "Keys" options (or changing the "When" condition to "Editing Text") seem to make the copy operation work, however, previous versions of Eclipse i.e. 3.3 had identical key preferences configurations yet the copy command worked on Text controls.</description>

In case:
function baz($b = se|lf::SKIN, $c = parent::BA||Z)

CA after self::| and parent::| should provide only constants in right context, not all PHP constants

      <title>[getter setter] Generate attribute and get/set in referenced object</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: 3.4

Quite often during development I will have a reference to an object when I realize that I need an extra attribute for that object. Currently I must locate the reference declaration, CTRL-click on the class name, then add the attribute. I then use "generate getters and setters". Finally I must return back to the location I was editing.

Could a new menu and dialogue be created which will automate all of this? I was thinking that I could highlight the reference, then choose a menu item which will allow me to type in the attribute name (and type). Eclipse would then add the attribute to the class and generate the get/set. The new get or set would then be available in quick assist for the reference.

Options could be:
- insertion location for the attribute name (usually just above the first constructor)
- insert location for the get/set (usually at the end of the class code, but before and nested class)
- scope

      <description>Consider a running eclipse, we want to open a file in that running eclipse.
in some directory, we invoke the launcher with --launcher.openFile and pass a relative path.

This new eclipse launcher passes the relative path to the running eclipse but that eclipse won't know how to resolve the path since its current working directory would be different.

The launcher passing off the paths will need to resolve relative paths before sending the open message.</description>

The warning is:

However the field in question ("INSTANCE"), is in fact hiding a field of the same name in the superclass. If I remove the @SuppressWarnings annotation, the warning appears. Thus it appears I can't do anything to be warning-free here: either I get the warning about hiding a field, or I get a warning about unnecessary @SuppressWarnings.</description>

      <title>Add ability to specify filter-path to build-options that support browsing</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: 7.0.0.I201001150805

Currently, build-options of browseType "file"/"directory"/etc allow the user to browse the file-system, but do not give integrators a way to set the default filter-path.  So, the Browse dialog by default opens at the root of the file-system.

The attached patch adds a new optional attribute for the &lt;option&gt; element - "browseFilterPath".  If the attribute is specified, the Browse dialog uses the supplied value as the default filter-path.  Macros in the attribute value are expanded.  If the attribute is not specified, the behaviour is unchanged.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a new C Project.
2. Open the Settings property page, and find a build-option that has a "file" browseType (eg. libraries) or a "directory" browseType (eg. include-path).
3. Click on Add... button to add a new entry.
4. Click on Filesystem... to browse the file-system.
-&gt; The Browse dialog opens up at the root of the file-system by default.</description>

Hello, 

We would like to have API compatibility between our Eclipse 3.4 and 3.6 code base. We have code that needs to compile and run against a 3.4 and a 3.6 GMF.
The issue that we are facing:-
The Util internal API has been removed, we get a compile error in our 3.4 code base when compiled against 3.6 Eclipse. 
import org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.emf.core.internal.util.Util; fails
Can you please get the internal back? Or can you please give us a workaround to resolve the compile error?

      <title>[build path] user library dialog should allow to select JAR from workspace</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: 

When adding a jar to a user library, you are give the dialog for selecting a file with an external path.

When attaching the source attachment or native library location you can select either an external path or a workspace path.

It would be useful to also be able to specify the jar location as a workspace path, which would aid in sharing projects with other people.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open preferences, navigate to Java -&gt; Build Path -&gt; User Libraries
2. Click New, and enter a name for the User Library.
3. Click "Add JARs", note the dialog type.
4. Select the "Native libary location" element, click "Edit".
5. Note the dialog type which allows for choosing an External Folder or Workspace path.</description>

      <description>Created attachment 156990 [details]
snapshot showing IUs in question

I20100121-0800, win7, Helios repo....

I noticed recently that the "PDE/API Tools Environment Descriptions" category appears as a subcategory of "General Purpose Tools" in the Helios repo.  OK...kinda different, but not a problem.

But then I thought that the same IU was appearing as a child of itself.  This is not the case, but the metadata is kind of unconventional.  The attached snapshot shows the list of IU's in the repo and the corresponding properties dialog info for each IU.

It seems like the feature group IU is marked as a category.
Then, the corresponding feature jar is shown alongside the other feature groups (since the feature group requires the feature jar).

I suppose there's technically not a bug here, but this is different than how most things appear, and could cause confusion because:
1 - we don't install categories, so the user won't see "PDE/API Tools Environment Descriptions" appear in the installed software list
2 - we don't show non-groups in any views or drilldown, so the feature jar of the same name won't be shown either.  So it will look like it didn't get installed.

The only clue the user will have that it's installed is that they'll see it marked as installed (grayed) in the install new software list, but they won't see it anywhere else.

For this reason, I think we need to examine why the metadata is the way it is.  Ideally the category would be a different IU, not the feature group itself.  I also wasn't sure if a tooling bug is at play.</description>

      <description>The remote file open funcitonality (--launcher.openFile) picks up any running Eclipse instance that fits the specified name ("Eclipse" by default).

If an "old" Eclipse application is running (say, Eclipse 3.5 SDK), the launcher will pick it up as the target of the "--launcher.openFile" command even as it can't process this request.

We probably should try to iterate through open Eclipse processes until we find one that can accept the "--launcher.openFile" command.</description>

Currently there is no way to configure Eclipselink to override existing negative values (only zero is overridden by default).</description>

      <title>Remove config.ini from equinox.p2.agent build</title>
      <description>The p2.ui.admin.rcp/rcp.product file has been updated (Bug 300538) and no longer requires the config.ini file.

The releng build should be updated to not copy this file.  See buildAll.xml/packageEclipseDistributables.

The config.ini file still exists in cvs, the build will work fine as it stands, we will remove it once the reference is gone from the builder.</description>

      <title>Cannot change user name in password required dialog</title>
      <description>I selected all my eclipse projects and hit compare with repository
I was prompted with a username / password dialog for cvs
I mistyped my username and entered the correct password
The dialog re-appears (obviously my username / password are not correct)
The username field is disabled and I can only change the password -- but it's the username field that's wrong

The only workaround seems to be restart eclipse.</description>

If you resolve any fatal problems - a JDT build path problem for example - and do an incremental build, the API tools error about aborting the build will not be removed.</description>

      <description>Running the Prov Admin UI (see bug 300484 re updating the launch config).  Add a metadata repository and see that it does not show up in the list.

Trying to add the repo again gives a duplicate location error.
Notice also that the repository preferences on disk (C:\Applications\eclipse\p2\org.eclipse.equinox.p2.engine\profileRegistry\SDKProfile.profile\.data\.settings in the default launch config) does contain the added repository.

Adding artifact repositories works fine.</description>

      <title>Executables View should support identical paths on different drives</title>
      <description>Created attachment 156997 [details]
screen shot

Original note from John:

When I add a file to the Executables view, the path to the file is recreated in the Executables project (see below). I don' tremember it doing that before. Is this a new, intentional behavior? I'm thinking maybe this was added to allow multiple same-named executables to be added? If so, then it continues to have a similar, but less likely encountered limitation. I can't add:

   c:\temp\somedir\p1.exe
   d:\temp\somedir\p1.exe

Clearly, including the drive letter in the path would solve that, but it makes for uglier behavior.</description>

      <title>ClassCastExceptions of "oracle.jdbc.OraclePreparedStatement" and "oracle.jdbc.OracleConnection" on GlassFish V3 against Oracle 11.1.0.7 DB</title>
      <description>This is first time we run JPA tests on GlassFish V3.0 GA, most tests of JPA CustomFeatures model, Inherited model, TimeStampTZ model and jpql model failed with ClassCastException. The same tests of all the four models passed on GlassFish V2.1 UR2. The oracle DB I am using is 11.1.0.7. 

1. Tests of TimeStameTZ and CustomFeature models failed with java.lang.ClassCastException: com.sun.gjc.spi.jdbc40.PreparedStatementWrapper40 cannot be cast to oracle.jdbc.OraclePreparedStatement

      <title>[planner] no solution when second feature patch installed by drop-in</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: multiple

I tried to update a single bundle (hello) originally installed via UI by two consecutive feature patches using drop-in install. 

The first patch applies fine. 

However when dropping in the second feature patch it does not apply. 

A log entry indicates: No solution...
This occurs independent of whether the second feature patch has the same or a different id of the first patch.

This behavior was seen in 3.5.1 and 3.6 I20100115-1100. 
In contrast in 3.4.2 the second patch is applied in either case so that the hello bundle is updated as expected. 

I am attaching the used features and feature patches. 

What is the envisioned behavior of multiple feature patches applying to the same original feature version? 

Without being an expert in the area I believe that in the past (pre P2) when multiple patches were applied the latest bundle versions would be active (at least for singleton). 

If patches are mutual exclusive -as it appears to be- it seems one needs a way for the user to figure out what they need to uninstall so that they then can install the intended patch.

Does it matter whether patches overlap (update same bundles) or not? 

What role should the feature patch id play if any?

Can/should feature patches apply to other feature patches? (I would think this gets complicated to manage quickly).

      <title>[PropertiesView] Maximizing a tabbed properties panel often reverts to simple properties view with property of another view.</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: 20090920-1017

When tabbed property panel is maximized it reverts to a simple property view with the property focus having changed to another panel's focus (ie, package explorer) from the original item of focus.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Download adobe lcds3 modeler plugin and install to eclipse 3.5
2.Install by expanding into dropins/modeler/eclipse
3. Open Data Model perspective.
4. File/New/Project and Data Model
5. In design view/style view create a new style.
6. Put focus on new style and see tabbed property view for the style. Double click this tab and notice it reverts to simple property view of another eclipse view.</description>

I tried Eclipse 3.4, 3.5SR1, and the nightly build of 3.6. When I click on the eclipse.exe file, the splash screen loads and then I am prompted to select my workbench. When I select the workbench, the IDE opens for a split second and then crashes. I get an alert to check the log file. Everyone that has upgraded to Windows 7 from XP is experiencing this problem in the company. Here is the contents of the log file:

      <title>[ql] Make matchExpression and contextExpression consistent</title>
      <description>The API for factory.contextExpression and factory.matchExpression are not consistent. That is, context expression takes:
contextExpression(Class&lt;T&gt; elementClass, IExpression expr, Object... parameters);

whereas, match expression takes:
matchExpression(IExpression expression, Object... parameters);

(notice the missing elementClass parameter).

However, when you actually create the query, the MatchQuery takes the element class, whereas the QLContextQuery doesn't.

Can / should these be made consistent?</description>

      <description>Created attachment 157012 [details]
3.5.x patch

+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #289384 +++

The filter implementation on the framework and the FrameworkUtil class throw an exception if the attr name starts with !, | or &amp; but these are valid characters in an attr name. 

The implementation is not in compliance with the spec.

Opening this bug to backport the fix to 3.5.2.</description>

      <title>Build Path Problem: A cycle was detected in the build path of project</title>
      <description>After workspace restart a plug-in bundle consistently has a build path cycle error.  Modifying the bundle manifest and saving it without making any changes to Require-Bundle causes the error to go away.  Import-Package is not used in this bundle.

The bundle manifest contains the following:

pre. 
Require-Bundle:  org.eclipse.swtbot.eclipse.finder;bundle-version="2.0.0",
 org.eclipse.swtbot.swt.finder;bundle-version="2.0.0",

 org.eclipse.core.resources;bundle-version="3.5.0"
 
Unless I'm missing something there are no cycles here.

      <title>NavigationProcessorTest.testNavigate() fails</title>
      <description>Hi Frank and co,

I've made some progress on this. I hope you can help me fix it.

- When run individually testNavigation succeeds.
- When run as part of NavigationProcessorTest it fails.

After some debugging, I found that the real exception was not logged. With some changes it comes down to this. Hopefully you can assist me from here:

      <title>pre, bc (block modifiers) can cause a leading empty line in the output</title>
      <description>pre, bc (such as pre. and bc.) cause a blank line in the output if there's no content following the markup.

For example, here's pre causing a blank line:

pre. 
some content

And here's pre causing no leading blank line:

pre. some content

There's already at least one blank line preceding the pre, so the leading line of the pre should be ignored if it has no content.</description>

      <title>NPE thrown when invoking content assist in JavaScript block of HTML or JSP file located in project without JavaScript Nature</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: 20090920-1017

If you have JSDT installed and are working with a project which does not have JavaScript support enabled, an NPE is thrown when invoking content assist in a JavaScript block of an HTML or JSP file and none of the JSDT content assist options appear in the resulting popup (this last part may be intended behavior).

Adding JavaScript support to the project will stop the NPE from being thrown, and the JSDT content assist options now appear in the popup.


NPE:

      <title>SWT.SINGLE Text fails to show all content when resized larger (Text.setBounds bug)</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: swt-3.5.1-win32-win32-x86

When typing at the right end of a single-line Text (implemented as Edit Control), Windows scrolls the text left to keep caret in view. If the Text is resized to show the full content, it remains scrolled with the start of the text invisible.

This problem is specifically identified in Text.setBounds. The author writes a fix that I believe is supposed to be triggered by testing whether the text width is greater than the control width. However, the control's width is actually compared to the control's margins alone (as in its trim), without adding in the text width. Therefore the fix is not done when it is needed and part of the text remains cut off.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
See attached demo TextResize.java.

A workaround for my particular application is after resizing, to detect that the caret is at the right edge, and then send the caret to the beginning and back to the end. This is demonstrated in the example. But it won't work in general since the shift may occur when the caret is not at the far right.

Solutions I have tried that did not work:
1) Turning off horizontal autoscroll. 
     *              int bits = OS.GetWindowLong (handle, OS.GWL_STYLE);
     *              bits &amp;= ~OS.ES_AUTOHSCROLL;
     *              OS.SetWindowLong (handle, OS.GWL_STYLE, bits);
The shifting of the caret into view must be unrelated to autoscroll.

2)   Sending the message that
     * is supposed to scroll Edit Controls. Although as usual, MS documentation
     * is vague about whether this works with single-line controls. 
     * In any case, it also does not work.
     *       OS.SendMessage(handle, OS.EM_LINESCROLL, 2, 2);//-2,-2 also fails

3) Creating the Text with SWT.RIGHT. It does stop the scrolling,
      but introduces a severe flicker, with redraw errors.

      <title>Validate that an Interface param's readonly attribute is inherited by Module implementers</title>
      <description>When an Interface declares a config param to be 'readonly', that property should be inherited by Modules that implement that interface.

Then, a Module implementer need not explicitly restate this 'readonly' attribute if they override the default setting.  As a result, if the Interface restrictions are lifted (e.g., the Interface removes the 'readonly' attribute making the field writeable), Module producers would not be required to rebuild against the new interface.

Some initial quick testing (with the Interface and Module in the same package) seem to indicate this is supported.  So this enhancement is perhaps simply a request for a test to validate the use case is supported.</description>

      <title>Update to I20100122-0800 deletes eclipse</title>
      <description>Wow, that's the funniest p2 bug I've seen so far:

I was running I20100112-something (updated via p2 from M3 I believe).
I have the classic SDK plus a number of additional plugins.
I tried updating to I20100122-0800, which caused some exceptions,
and when I tried to restart Eclipse I found no eclipse any more.

After restarting silently failed, I looked into the eclipse directory
and noticed that almost all files where missing, except:
  eclipse.ini
  artifacts.xml
and the following directories still exist too:
  dropins
  p2
  configuration
  plugins
  features
That's all that's left.
In particular: the eclipse executable has vanished.
Game over - please insert coin.

I might add that in order to find a valid configuration for updating
I had to uninstall XML editors from wst and m2eclipse plugins.
After uninstalling I chose not to restart Eclipse right away,
because I was going to restart after the update any way.
Other than that everything was just the normal routine.</description>

      <title>Can not get Subversive working in I20100122-0800</title>
      <description>After I got hit by "resolved" bug 300589, I manually installed
the connector like in the old days (*sigh*) but to no avail.
After restarting Eclipse I still get NoClassDefFoundError:
org/eclipse/equinox/internal/provisional/p2/metadata/query/Query
-&gt; connector discovery fails, SVN is dead unusable.

I have these connectors installed:
Subversive SVN Connectors 2.2.1.I20091009-1900
Subversive SVN 1.6 SVN Kit Connector 2.2.1.I20091009-1900

Why is connector discovery still triggered when launching the
workbench? Why is subversive still not functional?
("Info operation for 'myproject' failed.
Selected SVN connector library is not available or cannot be loaded.")

The preferences dialog still doesn't know about any connectors.

-&gt; Subversive in Eclipse I20100122-0800 IS BROKEN!

I usually don't set Severity blocker, but this one effectively 
blocks any productive work in Eclipse I20100122-0800.</description>

      <description>With Subversive from the weekly update site (20091207)
I got this NPE:
java.lang.NullPointerException

Only after I installed "Subversive SVN Team Provider Localization (Optional)"
the exception did not occur any more.

Is Localization optional or not??</description>

      <title>Suspicious cross package referencing</title>
      <description>Class ProcessRepoTask imports and uses
org.eclipse.equinox.internal.p2.jarprocessor.ant.JarProcessorTask.
When I imported all p2 projects into a fresh workspace the compiler
complained about the import and all uses of JarProcessorTask within
ProcessRepoTask. After cleaning project ..p2.repository.tools the
compile error disappeared.

I see three bugs:
1. The Java code is inconsistent with MANIFEST.MF, which should
   actually Import-Package the ..p2.jarprocessor.ant package
2. The compiler should not (after clean) accept that code.
3. Tests seem to be missing that would detect that JarProcessorTask
   isn't accessible at runtime (or is it accessible? why?)

The compiler part is related to a number of existing bugs:
bug 148844, bug 278745 and some duplicates. However, those bugs
essentially talk about Require-Bundle, whereas this issue involves
only Import-Package. In bug 148844 comment 35 I raised the issue
that the compiler is actually too eager to navigate along indirect
dependencies.

In the Plug-in Dependencies view I see that ..p2.repository.tools
"depends on ..p2.artifact.repository", which "depends on 
..p2.jarprocessor", but these dependencies are not accurate,
since they're not defined as dependencies between bundles but are 
Import-Package.</description>

Choose Platform Examples -&gt; Field_Assist_Example Feature	1.0.0

In M4, you'll get the prompt for unsigned content before the install.
In M5, you will not.

Somethings amiss in the service registration?
This is probably a UI-side issue, I'll investigate.</description>

      <title>[planner] M5 allows install of two versions of a feature while M4 says it's an error</title>
      <description>I've noticed a change in the resolution behavior between M4 and M5 with respect to installing two versions of the same IU.  Not sure if this represents an advancement (better handling of singlestons?) or a regression...

At any rate, the same metadata produces different behavior, and the behavior is not fully consistent within M5 wrt to both cases below.

CASE 1:

Help-&gt;Install New Software
Paste this site into work with and press enter
   http://www.eclipse.org/equinox/p2/testing/updateSite
Ensure that the [ ] Show only latest versions checkbox is unchecked

In the category Platform Examples select both of the following:

Field_Assist_Example Feature    1.0.0
Field_Assist_Example Feature    1.1.0

Choose Next

In M5 (I20100122-0800), both versions of the feature are installed.

In M4, the following resolution error is reported:

Cannot complete the install because of a conflicting dependency.
  Software being installed: Field_Assist_Example Feature 1.0.0 (Field_Assist_Example.feature.group 1.0.0)
  Software being installed: Field_Assist_Example Feature 1.0.1 (Field_Assist_Example.feature.group 1.0.1)
  Only one of the following can be installed at once: 
    Field_Assist_Example Feature 1.0.1 (Field_Assist_Example.feature.jar 1.0.1)

      <description>Using M4, this works. Using latest SDK for M5 causes NPE. 


Works as expected: 

   java -jar D:\buildzips\36M4\eclipse\plugins/org.eclipse.equinox.launcher_*.jar ^
   -application org.eclipse.equinox.p2.director ^
   -repository file:\\\D:\standaloneTest\org.eclipse.releng.tools-I20100121-0800 ^
   -list 

I'm listing as major, since I assume this would be considered "missing funtion". (I've not used it before ... just trying to dig into other bugs, such as bug 300417). Note, I actually saw this first with other repos,and am using "releng tools" in this example just so easier for you to reproduce. I just unzip the archived repo that's provided with the platfrom build. 
 

I've attached log for failing case.</description>

      <title>add 'palign(4)' to MSP430 .pinit section def in .xdl file (workaround 3.2.2 codegen bug)</title>
      <description>CCSv4.1 ships with MSP430 3.2.2.

3.2.2 introduced a bug related to .pinit that was not present in 3.2.1 (SDSCM00034776).

This workaround is only needed for large code and data models on MSP430.

Suggested workaround for this (from bug report above) is:


A workaround would be to ensure that the .pinit section is padded to a 4 byte boundary and that the padding values are zeros. This can be done by adding a 'palign(4)' specification to the linker command file. On the line that specifies the allocation for the .pinit section add the palign command as described in the linker chapter in the Assembler's User Guide. The linker will pad the section with zeros to a 4 byte boundary assuming that the fill value has not been changed from zero (the default fill value).</description>

      <title>[content type] XML Schema Editor not used for schemas without XML declaration</title>
      <description>Using the standard Galileo Java EE package, the XML Schema editor isn't available for schema files not carrying the an XML declaration at the beginning, such as &lt;?xml version="1.0" ?&gt;

This is caused by an interference between content types org.eclipse.wst.xsd.core.xsdsource and 2) org.eclipse.xsd

When the XML declaration IS present on a valid schema, the content type mechanism finds that both types are deemed VALID by their describers. But when the XML declaration is not found, XMLContentDescriber (the describer used by org.eclipse.core.runtime.xml, which org.eclipse.wst.xsd.core.xsdsource is based on) will return INDETERMINATE. This will rank below the matcher for org.eclipse.xsd, which will return VALID for any XML file with the appropriate 'schema' root element (since it uses the practical XMLRootElementContentDescriber2 available since Eclipse 3.3)

To reproduce: Create an XML Schema using the Wizard, save it, close, right click on the file, choose the "Open With" menu, check that "XML Schema Editor" is present. Now open the file, edit the XML, remove the XML declaration so the file starts with the root element (still valid XML!), close and right click again. Now the "Open With" menu doesn't show "XML Schema Editor", just "Text Editor" and "XML Editor". Also the icon switches to the "X" instead of the "S".

Possible fixes:

A) Adding the &lt;contentTypeBinding contentTypeId="org.eclipse.xsd" /&gt; to the XSD editor: It works, however I get the feeling that there's a reason for not doing so (e.g. the hyperlink detector and validation would not work, that could be extended to work as well, I suppose)

B) Switching to using org.eclipse.xsd exclusively? 

C) Add an even more loose describer for org.eclipse.wst.xsd.core.xsdsource which will describe anything with extension XSD or having any root element called "schema" as an XML schema, in effect wiping out the org.eclipse.xsd content type.

Option "A" would be my favourite, perhaps even with lowering the priority for org.eclipse.wst.xsd.core.xsdsource using it as a fall-back just like org.eclipse.wst.xml.core.xmlsource is used when the XML is "mostly" well-formed.

This is actually a pretty annoying bug -- it feels like a regression, but it's probably a by-product of org.eclipse.xsd changing its describer. Any chance for 3.1.2</description>

      <description>In my DSL I have to deal with c-style #includes.

Lets say I have file A including file B and B including A (aka cyclic dependencies).

My validator correctly creates a error annotation (left to the editor) on both files. 
On saving problem markers in the list are only created for the saved file.

If file A and B both have problem markers and the cyclic dependencies gets resolved both annotations get removed, but only the problem marker of the current saved file is removed.</description>

Using the org.eclipse.xpand2.output.XmlBeautifier as post processor has no effect. I noted, that the tests in XmlBeautifierTest all passes. Using the same programmatical way to run the beautifier with my XML file has the same effect as when executed in an oAW workflow (= no effect). Changing the encoding has also no effect. The org.eclipse.xtend.typesystem.xsd.XMLBeautifier out of the XSD typesystem project is able to format the XML.

      <title>IN Filter on a Table fails when added thru JSAPI interface</title>
      <description>Created attachment 157058 [details]
BIRT report design to show problem

* Might be a problem with the JSAPI interface parsing the IN filter syntax when a filter condition is programmatically added to a Table. Report attached to demonstrate. I'm using syntax format from BIRT Field Guide Ed 2, pg 308. 
* IN filter work fines if it is hard coded to a table using the Filter tab.
* Version: Actuate BIRT Pro 10sp1.

Run report in Web Viewer and click the button.
To see the syntax used, select the button in the designer, select OnClick() and click Script tab. Code in the onClick as follows. 


this.onclick = function(event)
{ 
var ht = this.getViewer().getCurrentPageContent().getTableByBookmark("OFCTable");
if (ht == null) return;  // Failed to get handle to Table	
var filter;

// Filter the table

// *******************************************************
// ********** FILTER using IN     ************************
// *******************************************************

// Syntax examples below all return Zero rows.
// var filter = new actuate.data.Filter("CITY", "IN", "('London' , 'Boston')" );
// var filter = new actuate.data.Filter("CITY", "In", "('London' , 'Boston')" );
// var filter = new actuate.data.Filter("CITY", "In", "('London' ; 'Boston')" );

var filter = new actuate.data.Filter("CITY", "In", "('London' , 'Boston')" );


// Try 3 below, gets error message:
// Exception  
// Report service exception(Information Console generate report failed.). 
// var filter = new actuate.data.Filter("CITY", "In", '("London" , "Boston")' );  // Try 3



ht.setFilters(filter); 
ht.submit();

// alert("Done!");

It would be much more useful if all breakpoint settings from the "Breakpoint Properties" properties dialog page would be in the same details pane inside the Breakpoints view.

After trying to use the details pane a few times now, I've reverted to opening the dialog, since I had to switch the details pane too often (either because I needed the other pane, or because I needed to set a condition and a hit count).</description>

      <description>Maybe someone would find this addition to the Equinox console commands useful:
http://philondev.blogspot.com/2010/01/adding-actions-to-eclipse-console.html

Its already prepared for the Eclipse namespace and the sourcecode is up for review here:
http://github.com/pke/eclipse_helpers/tree/master/org.eclipse.osgi.framework.console.action/
and here
http://github.com/pke/eclipse_helpers/tree/master/org.eclipse.osgi.framework.console.action.example/

What do you think? Could something like this included into Equinox?</description>

      <title>[breakpoints] Breakpoint hit count should only increase if condition is met</title>
      <description>I20100119-0800

The hit count of a breakpoint should only increase if the given condition is actually met.

E.g. debug this:

public class Try {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 20; i++) {
            System.out.println(i); // breakpoint
        }
    }
}

I made some experiments e.g. with:
- hit count: 5, condition (if true): i%2 == 0
- hit count: 5, condition (if true): i &gt; 10

=&gt; It looks like the hit count always gets incremented when the breakpoint is being passed. The condition is *only* evaluated when the hit counter matches the hit count. Before and after, the condition is never evaluated.

I can't think of many use cases where that would actually be useful. A better strategy would be to match the condition every time the target line is executed, and to only update the match counter when a condition indicates a match. This would e.g. allow me to set a breakpoint in Display#filterEvent(Event) that stops at second occurrence of a KeyDown event.</description>

      <title>[XML Catalog] [patch] External DTD subsets / schemas are attempted loaded for catalogs</title>
      <description>Created attachment 157062 [details]
Patch which disables validation and instructs parser not to load any external DTD subset

If a user provides a Next Catalog (or Delegate Catalog) which has a DTD reference to an external subset, or a schema location, the current XML Catalog implementation will cause this to be loaded, and fail if it cannot be resolved for whatever reason. This is completely unnecessary. The attached patch will fix this, increasing the likelihood that the catalog will work in e.g. disconnected scenarios.

Hope this patch can make it to 3.2 M5 and 3.1.2.</description>

      <description>Broken in I20100119-0800 and 3.5 Cocoa, works in 3.4.2 Carbon.

Command+. does not work any more in Trees. I just get an OS beep, and the KeyDown event for Command+. is missing.

In Eclipse, this is e.g. visible in the Search view, where Command+. should step to the next match. The reverse (Command+Shift+.) still works.

In the Java Editor, Command+. still works (jumps to next annotation).</description>

      <title>[Hibernate] CDO_Package_Unit type has a field which is too long for Derby</title>
      <description>The HibernatePackageUnitDTO has a ePackageBlob field which is a byte[]. For most databases this is correctly mapped to a blob. For derby this is mapped to a varchar. In Derby varchars have a max length of 32kb. In the mapping currently the length is set at 40000.

To let the hibernate store work with derby the max size has to be set to 32700 in the meta.hbm.xml.

See also here:
http://opensource.atlassian.com/projects/hibernate/browse/HHH-2651

Some other aspects:
- in mysql the field is mapped to a blob, is the size limit ever enforced by hibernate then?

An even better solution probably is to change the mapping to a blob and use the hibernate blob type.

I notice you now prereq org.junit4;version=4.5, but "org.junit4" is deprecated, and all it does is pre-req reexport the org.junit;version 4.x bundle. 

So, you should pre-req org.unit;version 4.5 directly ... right? Did you have trouble with that? Solving some other problem I'm not aware of?</description>

      <title>Speed improvement of directory listing</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: CVS HEAD

This enhancement improves the speed of the directory listing using the RemoteTools connection.
Before this patch the directory listing was slow because a sftp-stat was performed for each file when listing a directory. It is possible to get the same information for all files in the directory with a single stat call. This call is actually already done previously to get the file names of all files and we simply reuse this information in our patch. This patch removes redundant communication which increases performance especially for directory listings that are containing many files.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Connect with Remotetools
2. Open a directory</description>

Is there a way to get the aggregator to run on Eclipse SDK 3.5.2.M20100120-0800 or later? Could the manifest.mf's be relaxed a little so they are good with Eclipse 3.5.x instead of 3.5.a.specific.version?

      <title>Unnecessary Table Join in Native Query generated from JPQL</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: 2.0.0.v20091127-r5931

version: Eclipse Persistence Services - 2.0.0.v20091127-r5931

A rather simple JPQL query produces an unnecessary table join.
Please refer to the attached testcase (NetBeans project).

The generated native SQL is:

SELECT
    t0.ID
    , t0.PROVIDERID
FROM
    TRIP t0
WHERE t0.PROVIDERID NOT IN (
    SELECT
        t1.PROVIDERID
    FROM
        TRIP t2
        , TRIPEXCLUDE t1
    WHERE (
        (
            (
                (t1.PROVIDERID = t2.PROVIDERID) AND (t1.SEARCHERID = ?)
            )
            AND (t1.SERVICEID = ?)
        )
        AND (t0.ID = t2.ID)
    )
)

The SQL should be as follows (not including table t2):

SELECT
    t0.ID
    , t0.PROVIDERID
FROM
    TRIP t0
WHERE t0.PROVIDERID NOT IN (
    SELECT
        t1.PROVIDERID
    FROM
        TRIPEXCLUDE t1
    WHERE (
        (
            (
                (t1.SEARCHERID = ?)
            )
            AND (t1.SERVICEID = ?)
        )
    )
)

When I include a user library into a PHP project, the entry appears under the PHP Include Path tree in the PHP Explorer View, however, not all files and folders are visible in the tree.

For example, I've created a user library for Zend Framework 1.9. When I include this, for some reason the entire Zend/Db tree (amongst others) is not visible. I can Ctrl+Click through to classes, just not browse to them.

This appears to happen at random however the missing files / folders are the same each time.

I've tried removing and re-adding the include path entries and user libraries but the results are always the same.

      <description>Build Identifier: I20091210-1301 (3.6M4)

Extension Point declarations which use the same name for the Point ID as for their file name do not have the schema correctly loaded when trying to load/view the schema from a referencing extension declaration.

Basically, if the filename is the same as the Point ID, it doesn't work. This is *new* behavior since 3.6M4.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create an extension point schema called "schema/foo.exsd"
2. Set the extension point id in the schema to "foo"
3. Create an extension point entry in the same bundle's plugin.xml, and reference the id of "foo", and location of "schema/foo.exsd"
4. Create an extension based on this extension point. 
5. Click on the "Show extension point description" link. Note the error.

Now, change the id to "fubar" in all places, *except* that of the schema file name. The error no longer occurs.</description>

      <title>StyledText ignores StyleRange.metrics.width on OS X</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: swt-3.5.2RC1-cocoa-macosx-x86_64

StyleRange.metrics is used with StyledText to embed Controls and Images (see Snippet217). On OS X, it seems to ignore the width specified in the GlyphMetrics data placed in metrics. The space reserved by the StyleRange has width zero.  Therefore Controls and Images cannot be embedded.

Fails on OS X; works properly on Windows.

Tested with OS 10.6.2 and Windows XP.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run Snippet217 on OS X. 

2. See that the embedded widgets are rendered on top on the surrounding text.

3. To further confirm, tell the StyleRange to show its border:
        style.borderColor = display.getSystemColor(SWT.COLOR_RED);
        style.borderStyle = SWT.BORDER_SOLID;

See that the StyleRange has the correct height, but zero width. Instead the width should be StyleRange.metrics.width.</description>

      <title>Docking views vertically causes redraw problems</title>
      <description>I have been noticing this since the 3.5 release and even in the 3.5.1 release on windows 7.

Many times if I dock a view vertically to either the left or right side, it never draws itself fully and I have black or white patch in the middle of the view. Even minimizing eclipse doesnt work. Sometimes even closing and reopening the view doesnt work either. I have restart eclipse to make it work.

Most prevalent in the package explorer view since that is the one always open for me but i have seem it happening with other views too.</description>

      <title>DataModelWizard unnecessarily wrapping some exceptions</title>
      <description>DataModelWizard.performFinish() gets an IStatus object from the operations. If the result is an ERROR status type, the wizard randomly wraps this exception in a CoreException. 

This means that when the error dialog opens, the *actual* exception is second on the list, while the top exception includes almost no information at all:

1.Generate the code using modeling tool
&lt;target name="iscwccm.genCode" depends="iscwccm.genModel"&gt;
        &lt;java classname="org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main" fork="true" failonerror="true"&gt;

            &lt;arg value="workspace"/&gt;
            &lt;arg value="${iscwccm.dir.genModel}/portal.genmodel"/&gt;
            &lt;classpath&gt;
                &lt;pathelement location="${startupJarLoc}"/&gt;
            &lt;/classpath&gt;
        &lt;/java&gt;

      }
    }
    catch (Exception exception)

      <title>[Hibernate] Ensure/check that hibernate logging can be enabled in CDO Server</title>
      <description>Sometimes it is important for users to be able to see hibernate log statements in detail (for example which sql has been generated). I tried adding log4j.properties to a plugin and making this visible but this did not seem to work (hibernate log4j did not seem to pick it up).

This topic has to be researched further to see what the solution is.

      <title>Javax persistence _sometimes_ fails to find suitable drivers with same setup.</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: 

This is a bug based on this discussion and own experience: http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/eclipselink-users/msg02475.html

Using bundle A which is a JPA-PersistenceUnit provider and Bundle B which is trying to use this, javax.persistence will sometimes (more often than not in my experience) fail to find driver. Saying: Internal Exception: java.sql.SQLException: No suitable driver found for jdbc:postgresql://129.241.219.236/ractest.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a bundle with is a JPA-PersistenceUnit provider and defines and imports a jdbc driver
2. use said bundle in another bundle with 
emf = Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory(name, overrides);
       em = emf.createEntityManager();
3. Do this enough times and it will "hopefully" throw the following:

      <title>[implementation] Java Editor scrolls around when I expand selection</title>
      <description>I20100124-2000

Java Editor sometimes scrolls around when I expand selection.

Steps:
- From JDK 6, open java.lang.String
- On the last line of #toLowerCase(Locale), put caret into "String"
- Alt+Shift+Up
=&gt; no matter where in the visible viewport I was, the editor scrolls around and places the line that contains the selection to about 1/3 of the viewport from the top

This is annoying and did not happen in 3.6M4. Reverting bug 298106 solves the problem. I'd revert that bug for M5.</description>

Thread dump of deadlocked Eclipse

Build ID: Eclipse 3.6m4

Consider attached Thread dump from my deadlocked Eclipse. Here is what I did:

* Launch Eclipse app as debuggee
* File &gt; Exit the debuggee
  --&gt; My debuggee is terminated, but a child process is still running
      (I will attach a screenshot to show what this looks like)
* Switch from debug perspective to JDT perspecitve
  --&gt; Indexer started to run
* Switch back to debug perspective, right-click on the process to fully 
  terminate it
  --&gt; Main Thread is blocked

As per attached Thread dump, the "Process monitor" Thread has locked my instance of RuntimeProcess (0x086bf8e0) but does a Thread.join(). It looks like the Thread.join() cannot return because the Thread to be joined depends on other work which cannot finish. It is suspicious that a couple other Threads are waiting to enter my RuntimeProcess monitor:
  - Worker-14
  - Worker-5
  - main

Without knowing the exact code, it looks like RuntimeProcess.terminated() is "synchronized" but should not be synchronized because it does a Thread.join() which may be long-running and may depend on other client code. The rule of thumb is to never call out to client code from within a "synchronized" block -- it must be guaranteed that any synchronized block can complete without waiting for external things to happen.</description>

      <description>When the CDO Hibernate store encounters an unknown type it uses the Teneo DefaultToStringUserType. This is incorrect (that class is not present in CDO Hibernate Store).

      <title>Enable rules that controls ranges for feature inclusions</title>
      <description>An installable unit that is generated from a feature will always contain requirements with a strict version for all features and bundles that the feature depends on as 'includes'. The only way to specify a range is to instead list the dependency as a 'requires'.

In the old update manager, there was a semantic difference between these two. The things that were listed as 'required' was not installed together with the feature. Instead, they were treated as a prerequisite (had to be installed already) for the feature installation. With p2, I don't believe this distinction is there anymore.

Buckminster however, will currently not include the dependencies listed under 'requires' since they are considered a runtime installation thing. In 3.6, we might change this, but in 3.5 we cannot. Instead, we need to add some way to create more relaxed version ranges for the 'includes' entries. This can be done by two properties that can be added to the 'build.properties' file of the feature:

pde.match.rule.default = perfect | equivalent | compatible | greaterOrEqual (standard match rules)
pde.match.rule.retain.lower = true | false 


*perfect*
Perfect match, i.e. like today. Use the version verbatim.

 1.2.3.foo becomes [1.2.3.foo,1.2.3.foo]

*equivalent*
Greater or equal to the version using a version with the same major number and the next minor number as a non inclusive upper bound:
  
  1.2.3.foo becomes [1.2.3.foo,1.3.0)

OR if pde.match.rule.retain.lower is false:

  1.2.3.foo becomes [1.2.0,1.3.0)

*compatible*
Greater or equal to the version using a version with the next major number as a non inclusive upper bound.
  
  1.2.3.foo becomes [1.2.3.foo,2.0.0)

OR if pde.match.rule.retain.lower is false:

  1.2.3.foo becomes [1.0.0,2.0.0)

*greaterOrEqual*
Greater or equal to the version using a version with the next major number as a non inclusive upper bound.
  
  1.2.3.foo becomes the range 1.2.3.foo (i.e. open ended)</description>

Problematic .project file cannot be imported

On Windows, I defined a resource filter for "*:*" as per bug 155991 comment 5.
The .project file in question is attached.

Trying to import that project on Linux results in an NPE as below. I think that this is a critical issue, since it keeps users from opening projects without any workaround available. They won't easily find the culprit for the issue.

1. Import attached test project.
2. Extract testJSDoc.
4. Set JSDoc location for folder with extracted JSDoc.
5. Set focus on project (in script explorer).
6. Choose Nagivate-&gt;Open Attached JSDoc - it works fine
7. Set cursor on Shape_getColor() function.

      <title>TPTP Model regression breaks consuming product's use of Trace model</title>
      <description>The root cause of this issue is a TPTP regression introduced by https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=263122  However, it's more complicated than that.  The regression is in EMF generated code.  The association "method" between TRCMethodInvocation and TRCMethod was marked as transient in the ecore model, and was thus generated as a transient association in the Java code.  As such, when the recmodel was persisted, the association was not written to the file.

Interestingly, the genmodel and the ecore files, both of which were checked in at the same time as part of 263122 differ on this point.  The genmodel says the association is not transient, while the ecore says it is.  Both of these files are generated from the same source -- the Rose models (and the trace cat file which contains this data has not been modified since 2005.)

In order to verify that this was the source of the problem, I set a breakpoint in the debugger during EMF package init and changed the association to non-transient.  Testgen then worked fine.

Later today, I tried to regenerate the models from the Rose models using the version of EMF that is in RPT right now (EMF 2.6 M4).  Interestingly, in the newly generated ecore and java files, the association is again non-transient as it was before 263122.  Diffing this new ecore model with the one from TPTP 4.6 (HEAD), there are a total of 4 associations with became transient as part of the 263122 checkin, and all 4 of them are regenerated as once again non-transient with the latest EMF drop.  Also interestingly, if you try to open the genmodel file in the built in editor, you get 4 problems listed, each of which says "The opposite of a transient reference must be transient if it is proxy resolving".

Here is my theory:  we have a problem in our Rose models dating back to the beginning of the trace model.  We ignored the warnings for this problem, and things always just worked.  When Paul regenerated the models as part of 263122, he used a build of EMF that had a genmodel defect that caused these associations to become transient because of the problem in our source model.  It's possible that the EMF change was meant to be a fix itself, but someone complained about the behavior change and they corrected it.  Thus regenning the models now with the EMF 2.6 M4 driver corrects the issue.

There are several other differences in the newly generated ecore model, at least some of which appear to involve model objects that are not there.  I think Paul will need to review the newly generated ecore in comparison to the current one and determine if everything else is okay.

I understand that 4.6.2 is essentially shut down.  If so, we'll need to look into getting a 4.7 driver into our 8.2/3.6 adoption stream soon so we can fix this and test with recorders other than http.</description>

      <title>Simplify New Java Class Creation Wizard</title>
      <description>With the creation of a viable NewJavaClassConstructor, we should be able to significantly simplify the New Java Class Creation Wizard. I believe that our requirements are relatively simple: we need fields to capture the name of the new class. 

If a Java Project is highlighted when the wizard opens, that project becomes the home of the new class. If a package or class is currently selected, that package or the containing package becomes the home of the new class. If no Java Project is currently selected, but there is a single Java Project in the workspace, that Java Project becomes the home. If there is more than one Java Project, the one named "My Java Project" is used. If no project exists with that name, a drop down is added to the wizard to let the user select the project they want to use. If the workspace has no Java Projects, a new project with the name "My Java Project" is created.

For this first-cut implementation, the created class should contain, at a minimum, a main(String[]) method.

At some point in the future (and this is probably the subject of a different bug), I foresee this wizard being more dynamic and presenting additional options to a more experienced user. In a workspace that already contains several classes, we might include fields to specify the target package. In a workspace that already contains several projects, we might include a page in the wizard that lets the user create a new project with a name of their selection, for example. We might also include such things as automagic creation of unit tests, and other options.</description>

The query browser doesn't list all the queries, and the UI isn't ideal - there's no way to select with a mouse without invoking the query, it's hard to select all of one category etc..

The query browser isn't available from context menu.

      <description>Build Identifier: Build id: 20090920-1017

The DirectorDialog (org.eclipse.swt.widgets.DirectorDialog) has a "Folder Text Field" followed by Folder Label. 
When user choose any directory from the tree viewer, the that folder names appears in the foldet Text Field.
The DirectorDialog (org.eclipse.swt.widgets.DirectorDialog) has a "Folder Text Field" followed by Folder Label. 
When user choose any directory from the tree viewer, then choosen directory name appears in the foldet Text Field.

Bugs:


1)Refresh Problem
When user selects a folder then the folder name appears in the text field.
But if user renames it from the rename popup option then this text field is not refreshed with new value.

2) Behaviour Problem
Since this field is editable then its behaviour should be like renaming.
i.e. If user edit the folder name in this text field and press enter then treeviewer should get refreshed with new name.
and focus should in text field.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.In Eclipse, Choose File-&gt;Switch WorkSpace-&gt; Other
2.A Directory Dialog will appear asking the user to choose directory
3.Create a new directory with "Make New Folder" 
4.Folder Text Field gets filled with default name like "New Folder"
5.Rename the folder name 
6.After renaming, treeviewer gets refreshed with new name
  but Folder Text Field is still showing the previos value"New Folder"</description>

      <title>Mouseover highlighting of List's in ExpandItem's fails with new list model</title>
      <description>I've copied the menu (on the left) of the RAP online demo:
http://rap.eclipsesource.com/rapdemo/examples#Buttons

this.mainExpandBar = new ExpandBar(parent, SWT.V_SCROLL);
this.mainExpandBar.setSpacing(4);
this.expandItem = new ExpandItem(this.expandBar, SWT.NONE);
this.expandItem.setText("Title"); // title of expand item

this.menuList = new List(this.expandBar, SWT.SINGLE);
this.menuList.add("Item 1");
this.menuList.add("Item 2");
redrawItem();

// the ExpandItems's onmouseover hovering effect works fine

this.menuList = new List(this.expandBar, SWT.SINGLE);
this.menuList.add("Item 3");
this.menuList.add("Item 4");
this.menuList.add("Item 5");
this.menuList.add("Item 6");
redrawItem();

// the onmouseover hovering works only in the area of the previously set List (on 'Item 3' and 'Item 4')

public void redrawItem() {
  this.menuList.setData(WidgetUtil.CUSTOM_VARIANT, "EXAMPLES"); //$NON-NLS-1$
  this.expandItem.setControl(this.menuList);
  int height = (this.menuList.getItemHeight() + 2) * this.menuList.getItemCount();
  this.expandItem.setHeight(height);
  this.expandItem.setExpanded(true);

  // desperately updating, doesn't change anything
  this.expandBar.update();
  this.expandBar.redraw();
  this.expandBar.layout();

}

It seems, the area responsible for onmouseover events doesn't get updated when the List is changed.

Additionally I had to add +2 to the height of the item. Otherwise the initial List hadn't the right height when drawn first. When redrawing the List with another list model, the +2 offset isn't required anymore and makes the list appear 2 pixels per line greater than needed. This happens only in Eclipse's internal web browser. In Firefox (3.5) and Internet Explorer (7) the offset isn't required at all.</description>

The implementation of the method
org.eclipse.jst.jee.ui.internal.navigator.JEE5ContentProvider.projectChanged(IProject)
looks questionable to me:

1) Why should a content provider trigger the viewer refresh? Is here the right place for this logic?

2) If you do the refresh asynchronously (line 171): Display.getDefault().asyncExec(refreshThread) you should always verify whether the controls are still valid to prevent such SWTException ("Widget is disposed")

      <title>Ensure compiler compliance level is set correctly in newly created Java projects</title>
      <description>My test workspace is running on a J2SE-1.5 JVM, but is set at a Java-6.0 compliance level. I have a project that was created using a J2SE-1.5 library. When I try to run a class from that project, I get a java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError (essentially, the Java 1.5 VM is failing to run code compiled with a Java 6 syntax). I believe that this may just be as a result of my test workspace being a little abused over the past few months (the problem goes away when I create a new workspace).

Regardless of the cause, I believe that we will better serve our users if we guard against this case.

The NewJavaProjectConstructor should explicitly set the compiler conformance level (at the project level) when it creates a project.</description>

      <title>Authorization while getting CQuery or RMap</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: 3.5

A CQuery or a RMap (also reverenced RMap's) can not be accessed through a WebServer with authorization (LDAP used in my case).

The problem seems to be the ConnectContext given to ECF. In my case it was 'null' every time.

There has to be a possibility to access CQuery's or RMap's from a Server with User-Authorization.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
==== Open CQuery ====
1. File -&gt; Open a Component Query...
2. enter a url to a CQuery from a Server with User-Authorization.
==== Connect to RMap ====
1. create CQuery
2. fill the attribute 'resourceMap' with an URL to a RMap from a Server with User-Authorization.
==== Redirect to RMap ====
1. create a RMap and define a redirect to a RMap located at a Server with User-Authorization.
2. create a CQuery that references the previous created RMap -&gt; Press 'Resolve and Materialize'</description>

      <title>CDOENumStringType.nullSafeGet require identical name and literal for EEnum</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: I20091210-1301

In my application I define several EEnums in the ecore file. On initiating the model I get following exception:

[QUOTE]
The enum value string is not valid for enumerator: DataType
java.lang.IllegalStateException: The enum value string is not valid for enumerator: DataType
 at org.eclipse.emf.cdo.server.internal.hibernate.tuplizer.CDOENumStringType.nullSafeGet(CDOENumStringType.java:150)
[UNQUOTE]

As it seems the value 'string' is not recognized in the enum 'DataType' which I declare in the ecore as follows:
  &lt;eClassifiers xsi:type="ecore:EEnum" name="DataType"&gt;
    &lt;eLiterals name="boolean" literal="Boolean"/&gt;
    &lt;eLiterals name="integer" value="1" literal="Integer"/&gt;
    &lt;eLiterals name="float" value="2" literal="Float"/&gt;
    &lt;eLiterals name="string" value="3" literal="String"/&gt;
    &lt;eLiterals name="complex" value="4" literal="Complex"/&gt;
  &lt;/eClassifiers&gt;

If I debug I find that the method CDOENumStringType.nullSafeGet on line 147 is calling getEEnumLiteralByLiteral passing the enum 
name as parameter.

System outs from the method shows following:
name: 'string' // The name variable
getEEnum().getEEnumLiteralByLiteral(name.trim()): 'null' // That's why an exception is thrown
getEEnum().getEEnumLiteral(name.trim()): 'String' // The literal returned giving the name as parameter

If I modify the ecore declaration so that name and literal are identical and regenerate the model the code works well.

      <title>Invalid tests: sharing embedded objects is not allowed</title>
      <description>Both AggregatePrimaryKeyTest and AggregatePrimaryKeyOrderByTest in ComplexAggregateTestModel in jpa tests share the same embeddedId between several Entities. This is not allowed by the spec., in 2.5: 
Embedded objects belong strictly to their owning entity, and are not sharable across persistent entities.

One might think that because those embedded objects are ids sharing them between two different Entities (of two different classes) is ok because the embeddableIds are supposed to never change.
However that's not the case if the embeddableId uses Identity - in that case the value generated during Insert is read back into object - that means the pks will be different and EmbeddedId can't be shared.

This bug surficed after bug 300556 was fixed - it make Identity always override the existing pk value.
Before this fix the tests got the id value in the shared embeddedId that corresponded to the first object that used it; and tghis value was out of sync with the value inserted into db for the second object.</description>

      <title>[metadata] support mutually exclusive connectors</title>
      <description>Currently in Connectors Discovery we can select connectors which we want to install by using check boxes, but there are cases when you need to install only one of the connectors, i.e. connectors are mutually exclusive. For instance, in Subversive we have JavaHL SVN Connector and there are several versions of it: 1.4, 1.5, 1.6 but there's a restriction of JVM that you can install only one of them at the same time; of course, I understand that it's not a common use case, but there may be other use cases where this feature may become helpful as Discovery feature is planed to move to p2.

      <description>We are currently in the process of preparing an Eclipse-GMT MoDisco release for the next Helios milestone.

To do so, we have to register the MoDisco project to Babel. The problem is that there is currently no "modeling.gmt.modisco" project available from the registration webpage (titled "Babel - Define Map Files"), only a "modeling.gmt" one.

Could you help us solving this issue?

      <description>Refactor "Model Refactoring Wizard" code for better reuse and realignment. 

Some changes were made to the rename and move wizards. Both wizards are now functional, but the previous inheritance hierarchy is now broken (some reuse is still possible, but there differences present now that were not there before). This code should be revisited to see if there is a logical opportunity for code reuse, or if the wizards should be independent. If the latter is the case, the "Move" wizard should be cleaned up.</description>

      <title>Makefile parser should not log errors for unresolved -include statements</title>
      <description>Our GNU Makefiles include statements like these:

-include $(PRJ_ROOT_DIR)/*.makefile
-include *.makefile

in order to optionally include files when they are found on the disk. Whenever I open our Makefile in the CDT Makefile editor, I see errors like the following logged into the PDE Errorlog: I think that this is wrong because

  (1) The include statement is deliberately optional, so it is not expected
      to be an error when the included file is not found
  (2) The errorlog view should be reserved for unexpected program errors.
      Parsing errors like this one should instead be reported by error 
      markers / annotations like the CDT Indexer does (i.e. little blue 
      markers in the gutter of the Makefile editor).

Traceback of incorrectly reported errors looks like this:

java.io.FileNotFoundException: D:\Workspaces\ux\ws\userbuild_standalone_PPCissDiab\*.makefile (The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect)

      <title>Add ability to specify file-extension filter for build-options that support file browsing</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: 7.0.0.I201001150805

Currently, there is no way for an integrator to supply a file-extension filter for build-options that support browsing of type 'file'.

The attached patch adds a new optional attribute to the &lt;option&gt; element - "browseFilterExtensions". The new attribute accepts a comma-separated list of file-extension filters - eg. "*.lib,*.*". For filters with multiple extensions, a semicolon can be used as a sub-separator - eg. "*.lib;*.a,*.*". If the attribute is not specified, the behaviour is unchanged.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a C project.
2. Open the build-options property page, and go to an option of browseType 'file', such as 'libraries'.
3. Click Add... and then File system...
-&gt; the Browse dialog shows everything, giving the user no way to filter the content.</description>

      <description>Build Identifier: eclipse-SDK-I20091217-0819-win32

We would like the ability to override the Help Contents menu action to point to a custom help system such as a web 2.0 help system.  This would be done via an extension point.  The help system will likely be local, but would have a different URL then the original help system.  We may want to look at using the BaseHelpSystem interface for this solution, where the custom help is an implementation of a BaseHelpSystem

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Implement a custom help system
2. When Help -&gt; Contents is clicked, show custom help system instead of Eclipse default help system

      <title>Problems occurred when invoking code from plug-in: "org.eclipse.jface".</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: 20090920-1017

I deleted my prior Eclipse installation in an attempt to get around problems with 300524.  I reinstalled galileo and unzipped the OEPE oepe-galileo-11.1.1.3.0.200909171310.zip into the eclipse install dir.  I reloaded Eclipse and opened my old workspace, and re-created the Oracle weblogic 10g server.  The error dialog reported in 300524 does not show up, but a large number of errors are reported in the error view.

Fri Jan 22 16:55:35 EST 2010
Problems occurred when invoking code from plug-in: "org.eclipse.jface".

java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class org.eclipse.wst.server.ui.internal.provisional.UIDecoratorManager
at org.eclipse.wst.server.ui.internal.cnf.ServerDecorator.getStateImage(ServerDecorator.java:142)....

I will attach the log file.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. install eclipse-jee-galileo-SR1-win32.zip
2. install oepe-galileo-11.1.1.3.0.200909171310.zip
3. create an instance of the oracle 10g weblogic server.
4. start the server.</description>

      <title>[Preferences] [Jface] Add ability to set the filter-path on file/directory field-editors</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: 3.6M4

The FileFieldEditor and DirectoryFieldEditor do not expose the ability to programmatically set the initial filter-path for their underlying Browse dialogs.

The attached patch exposes this capability. This patch would enable Texas Instruments to contribute further enhancements to the CDT project (see bugzilla #300539).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
N/A - this is an enhancement to org.eclipse.jface.preference.FileFieldEditor/DirectoryFieldEditor classes.</description>

      <description>I don't like that derived features are read-only. I use them a lot in my properties view to show user friendly values.

IE: In my model I store all my values in metric, whatever the user wants to see. Then I have a derived property that shows the value in the user selected unit. My derived property converts it as requested. Using EEF I cannot do the same. I have to manually edit every file to add edit commands.

There is a read-only checkbox, if I don't select it then I don't want it forced upon me! Derived does not mean it is a constant value.</description>

      <title>[pmi] Simplify CQ Submission Process for Library Updates</title>
      <description>I was updating a lot of our dependencies today and I noticed that there is room for optimizations in this process.

Basically, I have to do the following steps for each update:

- Select "[request] to use, reference, or distribute third-party code
that is maintained elsewhere"
- Go through a search process which performs a search
- Select "[enter] new cq..." on the results page
- Fill out the form with all details
- Submit the form
- Open the new CQ in another browser tab
- Attach the source

I have to repeat the steps for all libs.

However, IPzilla already knows all the information and I already know the previously approved CQ. I wish I could skip the extra search and form in the portal. Instead, simply enter the existing CQ number plus the new version and a new CQ would be created right away with all the necessary info pre-filled from the foundation database.</description>

1- create a breakpoint
2- open its properties
3- create a new BreakpointAction
4- attach that action
5- Delete that action
-&gt; the action is still shown as attached, but if you close the properties and re-open them, it will be gone, but the decorator will still be there.

I think the deleted action should be removed right away.</description>

      <title>Ensure DynamicClassLoader returns valid type</title>
      <description>When a DynamicClassLoader returns a class, it usually is built by the dcl.
However, it is possible that there exists a class - reachable by the dcl's parent loader - with the same name.

The existence of this class may be a mistake, or it make be intentional if
a user wished to create a class that conforms to the DynamicEntity interface
specification.

DynamicClassLoader should check the 'assignableTo' property of the found class
and return an error if it does not conform, otherwise the found class should be used.</description>

      <title>Web service wizard Service Deployment Configuration view options corrupt each other</title>
      <description>Created attachment 157161 [details]
screen capture - only 1 ws runtime shows of the 3

The RAD web service wizard page "Service Deployment Configuration" allows users to select between 3 different views: Choose server first, Choose Web service runtime first &amp; Explore options.
- User can switch between each of these in turn and provided user makes no changes all views display correctly.
- If user expands the Server Types information in any of the views and there are a lot of servers defined (e.g. 6 or more), or 3 or more server types and expands each them in turn, then switches to either the Choose server first or Choose Web service runtime first views, one of the selection boxes becomes a scrollable window displaying only one line of text at a time. Expanding the size of the dialog reveals the other web service runtimes.

      <title>Facet support declarations by particular servers should override definitions marked for any server</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: WTP 3.2.x

Definitions for the org.eclipse.wst.common.project.facet.core.runtimes extension point to declare facet support for a particular runtime are always overridden by definitions that define the same extension point with applicability scoped to any server.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
For example the JPA tools plugin org.eclipse.jpt.core defines this to enable all versions of the jpa facet for any runtime:

&lt;extension point="org.eclipse.wst.common.project.facet.core.runtimes"&gt;
   &lt;supported&gt;
	&lt;runtime-component any="true"/&gt;
		&lt;facet id="jpt.jpa"/&gt;
   &lt;/supported&gt;

If an adopting product wants to restrict certain versions of the jpa facet to particular versions of it's runtime, like below (to only allow jpa 1.0 for xyz server version 5.0):

&lt;extension point="org.eclipse.wst.common.project.facet.core.runtimes"&gt;
   &lt;supported&gt;
      &lt;runtime-component
         id="com.xyz"
         version="5.0"/&gt;
      &lt;facet
         id="jpt.jpa"
         version="1.0"/&gt;
   &lt;/supported&gt;

When the user launches the new project wizard or the facet config page, and selects runtime xyz version 5.0 as the target runime, both jpa facets 1.0 and 2.0 are still shown as available for choice.  So it seems that the &lt;runtime-component any="true"/&gt; overrides everything else.  Can the overriding behaviour be changed such that particular runtime definitions always takes precedence?

It looks like particular runtimes can't define facet support/configurations that are more scoped, if there's a pre-existing definition for the same facet with &lt;runtime-component any="true"/&gt;</description>

      <description>When opening the saved results of a Memory Analysis profile of Object Analysis the method name and instance data is missing. In 4.5.2.1, the instance values exist but are 0 in 4.6.2/4.7.0. The method names appear as ?'s for all entries in 4.5.2.1/4.6.2/4.7.0 except for the last entry and does not take the user to the source.

1. Install the TPTP All In One.
2. Run an application with Object Analysis enabled for Memory Analysis.
3. Verify the Object data is visible and has instance data in the Allocation details view.
4. Restart the workbench and accept the option to save the data on shutdown.
5. When the workbench starts, load the Allocation details tab for the Object opened previously. The method information is not present and data is set to 0.</description>

      <title>subproject mode changed to plain file mode</title>
      <description>If a tree contains a subproject mode (160000), creating a commit in
EGit can convert this to be a plain text file mode (100644), which
results in Git assuming the target object is a blob in this project.

If the target object is actually a commit in this project, we get
weird failures from JGit trying to cast a RevBlob to a RevCommit,
and `git fsck --full` gets confused, claiming a blob was used in
a commit context.

This results in a corrupt repository, because the target isn't
valid anymore.</description>

      <title>Eclipse volunteer page</title>
      <description>There have been many discussions in the past about how it's difficult for people to get involved at Eclipse.  I was reading a blog today about community building and it suggested having a volunteer jobs page.

http://www.feverbee.com/2010/01/volunteer-jobs.html

I just looked at the main eclipse.org page and I couldn't see anything like "how I can help".  There is a newcomers page
http://eclipse.org/home/newcomers.php
but it doesn't really say how people can get help.

I think that this page could be something pretty lightweight.  Perhaps it could be generated automatically by submitting bug links in twitter with a common hashtag. 

Ideas for volunteer jobs include
1)Ian's request for a new Eclipse Logo
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=300271
2)PDE team needs help testing M5 this week
http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/pde-dev/msg01655.html
3)Splash screen contests
4) bugs with helpwanted tags etc.

If we used twitter, people could be updated regarding new volunteer opportunities as they become available. I'm sure most projects have small tasks where volunteers would be able to make contributions and increase the number of people involved in the community.</description>

      <title>Add support to DynamicSQLBatchWritingMechanism to generate a single batch instead of many</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: 1.1.4

This bug is about extending the support for batch writing without binding that was done under bug 297908.

The bug fix consist to use a different JDBC API to do the work. 

Instead of using:

/**
*  Retrieves the current result as an update count;
*  if the result is a &lt;code&gt;ResultSet&lt;/code&gt; object or there are no more
results, -1
*  is returned. This method should be called only once per result.
* 
* @return the current result as an update count; -1 if the current result is a
* &lt;code&gt;ResultSet&lt;/code&gt; object or there are no more results
* @exception SQLException if a database access error occurs
* @see #execute 
*/
int getUpdateCount() throws SQLException; 

Use this one:
/**
*...
* @return an array of update counts containing one element for each
* command in the batch.  The elements of the array are ordered according 
* to the order in which commands were added to the batch.
* ...     
* @since 1.3
*/
int[] executeBatch() throws SQLException;

Latest API gives more information, which is also needed to invalidate only the stale object, instead of all versioned objects involved.

I am using Teneo 1.1.2.v200912130725. Recently I noticed that "HbHelper.INSTANCE.registerDataStoreByPC(this);" was automatically called in "HbDataStore.initializeDataStore()" function. So all new HbSessionDataStores were automatically populated into "HbHelper.dataStoreByPersistentClass". Then it might be a good idea to remove its PC entries from the dataStoreByPersistentClass table while inside "HbDataStore.close()" function. Anyway entries in "dataStoreByPersistentClass" table is useless after the HbSessionDataStore was closed.

      <title>Enhancement Request: EAV schema numeric datatype's precision problem</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: M20090917-0800

I am using Teneo 1.1.2.v200912130725, and noticed two related issues while storing value in EAV schema. 

1. Precision issue while dealing with double type.

I have an EClass with an EAttribute or EDouble datatype.
    EAttribute element = ecoreFactory.createEAttribute();
    element.setName("element");
    element.setEType(ecorePackage.getEDouble());

Right now the eavvalue's DDL statement is:
    create table `eavvalue` (eavid bigint not null auto_increment, discriminator varchar(255) not null, eavversion integer not null, feature varchar(255) not null, valueIsSet bit, mandatoryValue integer not null, owner bigint not null, typeNeutralValue varchar(255), type varchar(255), stringValue varchar(255), dateValue datetime, numericValue decimal(19,2), longValue bigint, `reftype` varchar(255), `refid` varchar(255), `conreftype` varchar(255), `conrefid` varchar(255), listkey bigint, `idx` integer, `valuesholderid` bigint, `valuesholderidx` integer, primary key (eavid)) type=InnoDB

So numericValue is only decimal(19,2). And when I try to store a value "2.2222", only "2.22" got saved.

Now if I use NON-EAV schema, the DDL statement was
    create table `testtype` (e_id bigint not null auto_increment, dtype varchar(255) not null, e_version integer not null, `element` double precision, primary key (e_id)) type=InnoDB
Obviously 'double precision' can give me the right result back.

Question here is since EAV schema puts all numeric datatypes (e.g. DECIMAL, NUMERIC, FLOAT, REAL, and DOUBLE PRECISION) in one single column, so shall we pick the database type of highest precision for this column? I understand that might present some round up issues for 'DECIMAL' and 'NUMERIC'. Then another approach could be to use one EAV column of DECIMAL type to handle exact numeric data types (e.g. DECIMAL, and NUMERIC), and use another EAV column (e.g. double precision) to handle the approximate numeric data types (FLOAT, REAL, and DOUBLE PRECISION). 


2. Another problem is also related to storing EDouble value in EAV schema. Though it doesn't look like a Teneo issue.

When I try to insert the previous EAttribute into Database, after setting the following value:
    testeObject.eSet(testeObject.eClass().getEStructuralFeature("element"), new Double (2.3));

The insert statement looks like:
2547 [main] DEBUG org.hibernate.SQL  - insert into `eavvalue` (eavversion, feature, valueIsSet, mandatoryValue, owner, typeNeutralValue, type, stringValue, dateValue, numericValue, longValue, discriminator) values (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, 'EAVSingleEAttributeValueHolder')
2562 [main] TRACE org.hibernate.type.IntegerType  - binding '0' to parameter: 1
2562 [main] TRACE org.hibernate.type.BooleanType  - binding 'false' to parameter: 3
2562 [main] TRACE org.hibernate.type.IntegerType  - binding '1' to parameter: 4
2562 [main] TRACE org.hibernate.type.LongType  - binding '1' to parameter: 5
2562 [main] TRACE org.hibernate.type.StringType  - binding '2.3' to parameter: 6
2562 [main] TRACE org.hibernate.type.StringType  - binding 'java.lang.Double' to parameter: 7
2562 [main] TRACE org.hibernate.type.StringType  - binding null to parameter: 8
2562 [main] TRACE org.hibernate.type.TimestampType  - binding null to parameter: 9
2562 [main] TRACE org.hibernate.type.BigDecimalType  - binding '2.29999999999999982236431605997495353221893310546875' to parameter: 10
2562 [main] TRACE org.hibernate.type.LongType  - binding '0' to parameter: 11


So it's essentially same as
"insert into eavvalue (eavversion, feature, valueIsSet, mandatoryValue, owner, typeNeutralValue, type, stringValue, dateValue, numericValue, longValue, discriminator) values ('0', 'sdfa', 0, '1', '1', '2.3', 'java.lang.Double', null, null, '2.29999999999999982236431605997495353221893310546875', '0', 'EAVSingleEAttributeValueHolder');"

Now this statement works perfectly with MySQL 5.1. But if I try to insert the record into MS SQLServer 2008 through sqljdbc4-2.0.jar. The following error will occur:
com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerException: Error converting data type nvarchar to decimal.
    at com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerException.makeFromDatabaseError(SQLServerException.java:196)
    at com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerStatement.getNextResult(SQLServerStatement.java:1454)
....

Seems like '2.29999999999999982236431605997495353221893310546875' is too long for SQLServer's numeric representation (SQLServer maximum numeric precision is 38).

The second problem is not necessary a Teneo issue. But I am not sure whether there is an easy fix out of it, without changing column type for the 'numericValue' to something like 'double'.


Thanks for help!

      <title>EPartService activation and deactivation doesn't quite work</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: 1.0M3, I20100121

I've been looking into creating an editor stack using a part stack in e4.  I've found that EPartService's methods don't quite do the right thing in activate(), bringToTop(), and deactivate().

In 1.0M3, activate() will cause the stack to create a tab for the editor, but the actual editor content is not shown until the tab is explicitly selected.  bringToTop() makes no difference.  There is often a mismatch between what the stack believes is the active child and what the underlying ETabFolder believes is the active child.  deactivate() does not appear to have much of an effect.  Reactivating an editor does not appear to do much either.

I20100121 fixes some of the activation problems: activating a *new editor* will cause that editor to be the active child (at least, it is brought forward).  But activating an existing editor has no effect.  deactivate() seems to have no effect: the editor is not removed, nor is it disassociated to the stack (e.g., the dirty flag is still responsive).

      <title>When running a report with table groups and no data a numberformatexception occurs</title>
      <description>Hello.

The following error appears when using the frameset servlet only. If the resulting JDBC Query has no records and there are at least 4 table groups the following occurs. It seems that the datastream is returning a bigdecimal type but the data is null and therefore the NumberFormatException.

The following items have errors:

      <title>Process Controller no longer accepts new process launch requests on AIX after x number of launches</title>
      <description>The process controller on AIX seems to become partially unresponsive after a certain number of launches, making the agent controller unusable for any agents that attempt to launch after this condition is reached. My simple tests put the number of launches required to get into this state at about 4 command line launches (e.g. processes not launched by process controller), or 14 regular launches. 

Either of these conditions could be met on an agent controller that is running for a sufficient period of time.

The problem is due to the stack size limit of AIX. When the agent controller was originally ported, the default stack size for a thread was set to high (4MB). Solution will be to update this value without impacting stack-intensive parts of the application.

AIX is the only platform in which our code is required to deviate from the OS default stack size, and the only platform we have seen this problem on.</description>

Check the checkbox 'allow output folders for source folders' in the properties UI, Then can select output folders for every source folder. But If there are same name classes in different source folders. Eclipse will throw error with 'already defined'. If I can put SAME NAME(including package) class in different source folders, It will be very good.

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Add two source folders into a java project
2.Check the checkbox 'allow output folders for source folders' in the properties UI
3.Put two SAME NAME(including package name) classes
4.Eclipse will show errors in the second source folders</description>

      <title>Enable explicit activation of repository</title>
      <description>Build Identifier:  I20091210-1301

In order to be able to add additional properties (e.g. database properties) to a repository before activation, it would be needed to have an option to explicit activate the repository after calling RepositoryConfigurator.configure(configFile). 

Currently calling RepositoryConfigurator.configure(configFile) will implicit activate the repository through the call CDOServerUtil.addRepository(container, repository), which in its turn calls LifecycleUtil.activate(repository). By adding an optional boolean parameter to RepositoryConfigurator.configure(configFile) and CDOServerUtil.addRepository(container, repository) one can achieve an explicit activation of the repository. The programmer will have to call LifecycleUtil.activate(repository) by himself at a later point in the initialization.

There's two places of dead code in pde.ui:

This looks fishy:

	testFindItem = null;
	if (testFindItem == null) {

2) org.eclipse.pde.internal.ui.wizards.product.ProductIntroOperation.generateFiles(IProgressMonitor):

      <title>Add support for vectorized charts in PDF</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: M20090917-0800

Hello BIRT-Team,

currently if I export a report to PDF all charts will be automatically converted to jpg or png images.

I noticed that you already offer a PDF Render device in your chart api which seems to work perfectly to create vector based charts for PDF.
I wonder why you are not using this render device for your PDF report creation ? It would be a great benefit for printing and viewing PDF reports online.

If you don't want to use this API for certain reasons then you could transform any chart to SVG and use the Batik API or FOP API inside your pdf emitter to convert the SVG chart to vector based PDF charts.

If I can support you in any way please let me know.

Thanks and best regards
Tobias

      <title>[JFace] Too many SWTFactory classes</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: 20090619-0625

I found many SWTFactory classes in my Eclipse installation:

org.eclipse.debug.internal.ui.SWTFactory
org.eclipse.pde.api.tools.ui.internal.SWTFactory
org.eclipse.jdt.internal.debug.ui.SWTFactory
org.eclipse.pde.internal.ui.SWTFactory

probably there more of these classes.

All of them contain similar or exactly the same methods and method bodies. Why is there not only 1 class? Maybe it should be located in the SWT main bundle already?

      <title>Bad cast between EClassImpl and EObjectImpl</title>
      <description>Hi,

There is a JavaClassCastException in the WeaverUtil class from the org.gmt.weaver plugin.
It comes in line 223. To correct it, it is needed to change EClassImpl and EObjectImpl in EClass and EObject.

The bug comes from switching from EMF 2.4 to EMF 2.5 which have different inheritance hierarchies. 

Best regards,

      <title>[compiler] private static Variable hides public Inner class</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: 20091217-0918

Hello,

If you use the JDK-Compiler
The following class:

--------------------
package testpackage;
public class TestClass {
    private int Inner = 10;    
    public class Inner {
        public final static int value = 10;
    }
}
--------------------

can be used by the class:

--------------------
package testpackage;
public class UsingClass {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int i = TestClass.Inner.value;
    }
}
--------------------

Error in the IDE:
The field TestClass.Inner is not visible	UsingClass.java	/testcompiler/src/testpackage	line 9	Java Problem

I know it is bad style to name the Variable starting by a Capital. The code is not created by me, the others use netbeans and I am quite annoying by using eclipse. The error happens in galileo as well.

      <title>When using eclipse events and doing a delete the commit is skipped</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: 2.0.0

This is a complex problem, but it is reproducible.
- there are two entities in a master detail relation
- on the child relation an eclipse "postDelete" event is present
- this event gets there by adding a listener to the event manager of the class descriptor and that routes the event to the entity (emulating JPA @events)
- the jdbc connection runs in a delayed constrained mode, checking the on commit. 
- In order to do this, a custom jdbc driver and connection implementation is used that executes a "set constraints all deferred" on the appropriate moments

When the master is deleted, the foreign key of the child results in an exception upon commit. However, if the postDelete method executes a native query the commit is never called! All connections are just closed.

In the attached zip a totally stripped example is present. This is the output without the event method:

Exception [EclipseLink-4002] (Eclipse Persistence Services - 2.0.0.v20091127-r5931): org.eclipse.persistence.exceptions.DatabaseException

      <title>Split IResourceServiceProvider into UI dependent and runtime part</title>
      <description>The IResourceServiceProvider provides access to language specific services form the outside by means of its Registry. 

We need UI dependent services, such as a label provider for EObjectDescriptions, as well as runtime services. To avoid API dependencies we should split that up.

Proposed structure:
1) IResourceServiceProvider for the runtime services
2) IResourceUIServiceProvider for UI services, inherits from 1)
3) DefaultResourceServiceProvider implementing 1), registered in the language's standalone setup
4) DefaultResourceUIServiceProvider implementing 2) and delegating to an instanceof 3) for methods of 1), registered in the language's UI plugin.xml to the interface 2) 

That we, both service interfaces / implementations are easily extensible without messing up the module bindings.</description>

      <title>allow clients to extend composite artifact/metadata repo</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: 3.6 M4

We have requirement to construct a composite repo from our special definition files. So we contribute ourselves composite factory to load the composite repo. The existing concrete ICompositeRepository is a common implementation and could be reused. Because ICompositeRepository doesn't have many special methods, just add/remove/get the children's uri.
Yes, the concrete implementation is internal, we should not depend on it. But I think it's general, any implementation of ICompositeRepository would use list to record the children. And the risk of using it is less than copying it in our code.

- Le ModifyListener est inutile car à chaque frappe ça émet une commande rendant la command stack inutilisable tellement il y a de commandes (nous recommendons de ne garder que 2 listeners : focusLost et un keyListener sur la touche CR).

- l'objet est dupliqué pour le présenter dans le wizard afin de ne pas modifier l'objet courant. Il aurait mieux valu conserver l'objet réel et différer l'exécution des commandes de modifications sur "finish" lorsque l'affichage est en mode wizard.

- De plus sur "finish" ça envoie trop de notifications. En effet, même si un attribut n'a pas été modifié, il est tout de même "resetté" entraînant des ViewerNotification. Il faut uniquement reporter sur l'objet réel, les modifications qui ont été faites. En gros, il faut savoir quelles sont les features modifiées plutôt que de ressetter tout l'objet.

      <title>Tooltip for column header</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: 20090920-1017

The current version of GridColumn does not support to set a tooltip for the column header.

I have made minor changes to the classes GridColumn and Grid to implement this for our product. I don't know if this is the best way to implement this but it works for our product so i thought to share the result.

I hope can be implemented in a future release.

      <title>[projection][rulers] Annotation summary in overview ruler hover should be sorted</title>
      <description>I20100125-1800, follow-up to bug 63692

The annotation summary in overview ruler hovers should be sorted. This is an old issue, bug 63692 makes it more prominent. If you fold main(..) below, the summary hover is sorted randomly:

public class Yo {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		foo1(); foo2(); foo3(); foo4(); foo5(); foo6(); foo7(); 
		bar(); //TODO
	}
}

The annotations should be sorted by source position. If possible, the importance of the annotation should be used as primary sort criterion (error &gt; warning &gt; task).</description>

      <title>Generation issue: Abstract_()</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: M20080221-1800

Cela concerne la génération d'une checkBox pour une propriété dont le nom est "abstract".
Le problème se trouve au niveau du template "updater" dans checkboxControl.mtl
la méthode toJavaClassifier() est appelée sur la propriété "abstract". Comme c'est un mot clé,  cette méthode retourne"Abstract_"

Le code générée par EEF est donc :
  basePart.setIsAbstract(dataValue.isAbstract_());

alors qu'il devrait générer :
  basePart.setIsAbstract(dataValue.isAbstract());

4. Search for 'Terminate'. You should see 'Terminate' and 'Terminate and Relaunch'.
5. Bind 'Terminate and Relaunch' to Ctrl+Shift+F2. Click 'OK'.
6. Debug the application.
7. The breakpoint is hit.
8. In the 'Debug' view, select the stack frame and hit Ctrl+F2.
9. The application termiantes as expected.
10. Repeat steps 6 and 7.
11. In the 'Debug' view, select the stack frame and hit Ctrl+Shift+F2.
12. Nothing happens.
13. Bring up the context menu, it clearly says 'Ctrl+Shift+F2' for the 'Terminate and Relaunch' action.
14. Select the action. It works as expected.

      <description>Ensure that AC does not depend on deprecated libs in Linux.

Over the past few years, the RHEL and SuSE Linux distros have moved to newer versions of the libstdc++ libraries, while providing the deprecated APIs and bits in optional "compatibility" libraries. The TPTP 4.5.2.1 Agent Controller and earlier is compiled against the older libs.

To ensure that the AC works on Linux, the consuming product's installation checks for the presence of the older libs and blocks until they are installed. On RHEL4 and RHEL5 systems, they remain available and supported yet, but I don't know about RHEL6. On SLE10 systems, they are available, but on SLE11 systems they are not available on some platforms and available but not supported on others.

This has forced a recompilation of the AC to use the newer libs, at least for SuSE. The following was created to address this case:

https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=240677

We'll need to ensure that this set of bits runs on RHEL also, or compile for those also.</description>

      <description>I ship a JRE with my RCP product. To add a JRE I define a root folder in one of my features pointing to the JRE:

bin.includes = feature.xml
root.win32.win32.x86.folder.jre=jre/win32

 This leads to having a jre folder next to the products executable when exporting the product, which is great. Now I try to do an update using p2. p2 tries to replace the jre folder when updating the feature containing the jre root folder. Unfortunately on windows this fails because it is not possible to delete the jre folder because some files of the jre are locked.</description>

      <title>Exported product contains root folder twice</title>
      <description>I ship a JRE with my RCP product. To add a JRE I define a root folder in one of my features pointing to the JRE:

bin.includes = feature.xml
root.win32.win32.x86.folder.jre=jre/win32

 This leads to having a jre folder next to the products executable when exporting the product, which is great. But I realized that the products size dramatically increased: There is a new folder jre in the root folder of size 86 MB, which is expected of course. But there is also the file eclipse\p2\org.eclipse.equinox.p2.core\cache\binary\foo.bar.product.jre.feature_root.win32.win32.x86_1.6.17 with size 30MB which is about the size of the zipped JRE folder. I assume the root folder is stored twice, once as jre root folder, once packed into this binary jre.feature file. Which seems like a substantial waste of space.</description>

      <title>DiagramDocumentEditor should not call setInput on dispose</title>
      <description>DiagramDocumentEditor calls super.setInput(null) in its dispose() method. super.setInput(...), among other things, calls configureDiagramEditDomain(). If the client editor returns null for diagram editing domain when input is null (which is a reasonable thing to do), then this method fails with NPE. 

There doesn't seem to be a good reason for calling super.setInput(null) as part of dispose. stopListening() method, called from super.setInput(...) is needed in dispose, but it is called from super.dispose() anyways.  

I attached the patch that removes this call. Cherie, do you mind double-checking this? Thanks!</description>

      <description>Build Identifier: 20090917225226

Hello.

I have attached a valid WSDL file.
In the response there is an 'EmailAddress' node with cardinality 0..1.
This is the node that causes the bug.
Please have a look at the 'Steps to Reproduce' section.
I have also attached screenshots of the steps to reproduce the bug.

Best Regards,
 Stoyan

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
0.0 Within Eclipse, copy the wsdl file into a project (Java project for example)
0.1 Right click the copy -&gt; Properties -&gt; make the file 'Read only'. please see 0.1.jpg
0.2 Double-click to open the wsdl file within Eclipse (Choose the 'Design' view, not the 'Source' one). 
1. Open the output node as shown in 1.jpg
2. Click the 'Show schema index view' button inside the visual editor as shown in 2.jpg
3. Open the BasicData_type type as shown in 3.jpg
4. Change the municipality of the EmailAddress node to 1..1 (required) as shown in 4.jpg
5. When asked to make the wsdl file writable, click Yes as shown in 5.jpg. Save the changes if they are not auto-saved.
6.1 When you click the wsdl tab, instead of the types of the input/output, a red label 'element or type undefined' is shown. please see 6.1.jpg
6.2 When you click again the other tab (containing the information about the BasicData_type type), a NullPointer Exception is raised. please see 6.2.jpg</description>

      <title>Better configurability for pde.convertSchemaToHTML</title>
      <description>When generating schema documentation via the pde.convertSchemaToHTML
ant task, configurability is currently limited:

I can define a cssURL but it *must* have a protocol, so
 "../../css/book.css" is illegal whereas
 "file:../../css.book.css" is legal but doesn't work.
Is there a better way to specify the URL? I also tried a
platform:/my.plugin/path URL but to no avail.
Alternatively could checking be relaxed to allow protocol-less URLs?

Actually the generated html refers to two CSS but the other
one ("../../schema.css") is not configurable. Would be great if
both could be configured consistently.</description>

Although Java application profiling works fine in an up-to-date 32-bit install of Eclipse 3.5.1 "Galileo" on a Slackware Linux 13.0 system, when I try the same thing on a 64-bit install of the same I see (briefly) the console message:

and then the Error popup message:

When using the New Java Project from Ant build file dialog,
the created project has JRE_LIB in the Referenced libraries
instead of using JRE System Library (as set in the workspace
default).

The problem is that when using endorsed libraries (such as for
JAX-WS 2.2 with JDK 6), JRE_LIB will not work.  One needs to
use JRE System Library.

      <title>ZoomManager "beeps" on Mac Cocoa</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: I20091210-1301

This only happens on Mac Cocoa.

I have a GEF-based Editor that contributes a ZoomComboContributionItem to its toolbar. If I de-focus the editor and re-focus it I get a Mac system "beep". I have traced this to the ZoomManager method setZoomAsText(String zoomString):

public void setZoomAsText(String zoomString) {
	if (zoomString.equalsIgnoreCase(FIT_HEIGHT)) {
		primSetZoom(getFitHeightZoomLevel());
		viewport.getUpdateManager().performUpdate();
		viewport.setViewLocation(viewport.getHorizontalRangeModel().getValue(), 
				viewport.getVerticalRangeModel().getMinimum());
	} else if (zoomString.equalsIgnoreCase(FIT_ALL)) {
		primSetZoom(getFitPageZoomLevel());
		viewport.getUpdateManager().performUpdate();
		viewport.setViewLocation(viewport.getHorizontalRangeModel().getMinimum(), 
				viewport.getVerticalRangeModel().getMinimum());
	} else if (zoomString.equalsIgnoreCase(FIT_WIDTH)) {
		primSetZoom(getFitWidthZoomLevel());
		viewport.getUpdateManager().performUpdate();
		viewport.setViewLocation(viewport.getHorizontalRangeModel().getMinimum(),
				viewport.getVerticalRangeModel().getValue());
	} else {
		try {
			//Trim off the '%'
			if (zoomString.charAt(zoomString.length() - 1) == '%')
				zoomString = zoomString.substring(0, zoomString.length() - 1);
			double newZoom = NumberFormat.getInstance().parse(zoomString).doubleValue() /100; 
			setZoom(newZoom / multiplier);
		} catch (Exception e) {
			Display.getCurrent().beep();
		}
	}
}

In Cocoa setZoomAsText() is being called with an argument of "" thus we get the Display.getCurrent().beep(); call.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run the attached snippet.
2. It already shows a horizontal scrollbar.
3. Enlarge the first column, so that the second column is not shown completely anymore.
4. The scrollbar is not updated and therefore it is not possible to make the second column visible.</description>

public class LilyPondLabelProvider extends DefaultLabelProvider {

	public String text(EObject object) {

	}

	public String image(EObject object) {

      <title>[ui] Support event tracing</title>
      <description>Many of the UI bugs surrounding oddities in the "work with" combo of the install wizard, or button enablement issues, have been associated with incorrect handling of repository events.  In some cases, the event was wrong (a bug), in other cases the UI is overresponding or underresponding to some event.

To better debug these situations, we need a trace on the eventing.  

We could really use one in general in p2, but for these specific cases, doing at the UI listener level is necessary to interpret things like event batching.

Should also look into the dynamic trace API (ie, dynamically turning on tracing in the running eclipse) as these bugs are often hard to reproduce in a self-hosted environment.</description>

      <description>Build Identifier: eclipse 3.5 build

I need to update the platform target definition, but my update gets overridden after it is saved.

I use the below code in the preferences server tab to update the container path of the target definition.  If I open the target platform tab then execute the code in the server tab, the path will not be updated.  If I don't open the target platform tab, if I remember correctly, the path is updated.

I set a break point at the saveTargetDefinition(.), after it, the xxx.target file is updated with the correct path.  But after clicking the OK button on the preferences, the original value is written back to the file.

try {
  ITargetDefinition dfn = thisHandle.getTargetDefinition();
  IBundleContainer bContainer = srv.newDirectoryContainer(newPath);
  dfn.setBundleContainers(new IBundleContainer[] { bContainer });
  srv.saveTargetDefinition(dfn);
  } catch (CoreException e) {
  	e.printstack();
	}


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open preferences - Plugin development - target platform.
2. switch to another tab, like the server tab, execute the code.
3. click OK on the preferences.</description>

      <title>install fisheye on build.eclipse.org to integrate into Hudson for change auditing</title>
      <description>In the old Common Modeling build, we have SearchCVS; in Dash Athena, we do not... and it doesn't scale very well, nor do I want to maintain it anymore.

So, here's a possible replacement, which supports CVS, SVN, and even Git:

http://www.atlassian.com/software/fisheye/

An actual working example of drilling into a file's history by revision, tag, author, date, etc, linked from a Hudson build page:

http://fisheye.jboss.org/browse/JBossTools/trunk/jbpm/plugins/org.jboss.tools.jbpm.common/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF

It also appears you can link from Fisheye back into Eclipse:

sample project to import

Using a non-default bundle root location for a project, with the source &amp; class files (output folder) contained outside the bundle root, OSGi cannot find the classes at run/debug time from the IDE.

For example, the bundle root is at /bundle/root, the source is in /src and the output folder is /bin (all project relative). Dev.properties specifies the location of the classfiles as /bin, but I suspect OSGi is looking for this relative to the bundle root rather than the project.</description>

2. Create new Tigerstripe project (TestProjectOne)
3. Create new Tigerstripe project (TestProjectTwo)
4. Create a new package (at root level) in TestProjectOne named "root"
5. Create two new entities under "root" package in TestProjectOne
6. Refactor "root" to be renamed to "root1". Note that entities create
    created in 5 are now gone but no error messages are present in log.
7. Delete TestProjectOne and TestProjectTwo.
8. Create new Tigerstripe project (TestModelOne)

      <title>Using sftp instead of ssh exec of cat to transfer files</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: HEAD

RemoteTools was using ssh exec of cat to transfer files. This had the disadvantages:
- being slow
- no guarantee of file being saved when stream is closed. As a consequence files were not available when stat or read was done right after save (e.g. when creating project) 
- no error handling of transportation problems

With this patch sftp is used for uploading and downloading of files. This solves all above problems. No fall-back to exec are used, because sftp works reliable in all our tests. The fall-back which was there is removed by the patch because it causes a thread dead-lock.

      <description>The TextProcessor - both current implementation and the future enhanced version (bug 183164) need to have knowledge of the String contents. Something like: is it a file? is it an XML element?

However, the common situation is that this information is available to the string's Originator, but not to the string's Consumer. Moreover, typically the string woudl be passed through several layers of APIs:

 Originator -&gt; API1 -&gt; API2 -&gt; Consumer

      <description>This is first time we run JPA tests on GlassFish V3.0 GA, all tests of the whole test model passed on GlassFish V2.1 UR2.

For running the test model, we already copy sdoapi.jar to GLASSFISH_HOME/domains/domain1/lib, and the remained five tests of this test suite passed, only testSetup() failed with "java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: oracle/spatial/geometry/JGeometry", that's strange. Becuase if I remove sdoapi.jar from GLASSFISH_HOME/domains/domain1/lib, then all tests failed with this NoClassDefFoundError. So this test failed while the rest five tests passed, that means the sdoapi.jar is under classpath at that time, it seems that the jar can't loaded only when running testSetup().

The suite is org.eclipse.persistence.testing.tests.jpa.structconverter.StructConverterTestSuite.</description>

      <title>Control.print(gc) produces various side effects</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: SWT N20100120

When printing a component, there are various side effects.

This is a follow up on the discussions from bug 299714. Other related bugs are bug 223590, bug 223800, bug 267466, bug 267468 and maybe bug 225091.


1. Windows XP (tested on 32 bit computer JDK6u18)

- Painting artifacts when a window is dragged over the control.
- The control is reparented at the wrong location if the window is moving.

- These can be fixed with this "improved method":
Rectangle bounds = control.getBounds();
control.print(gc);
control.setLocation(bounds.x, bounds.y);
control.redraw(0, 0, bounds.width, bounds.height, true);
control.update();
-&gt; But I think the containers in the control hierarchy can occasionaly get painting artifacts too which are not cleared by this approach. Still, it is way better.

- The NativeSwing hack works fine but incurs a performance penalty.


2. Windows 7 (tested on 64 bit computer with 32-bit JDK6u18 and 32-bit JDK6u11, and on 32 bit computer JDK6u11)

- When print happens, the window is brought to front. There is some sort of focus stealing/restoring.
This is a big issue because you cannot work with other windows when a component is being printed.

- The NativeSwing hack has the same focus issue.
If fixPrintWindow is forced to false in Control.printWidget(int, int, GC), then the hack works fine (but with that aforementioned performance penalty).

-&gt; It seems that activating the NativeSwing hack in addition to the SWT fix (fixPrintWindow not forced to false) can result in the unusable state (bug 299714) so they have to be exclusive.

We need a way out, even a temporary solution. Could there be an undocumented system property that would force fixPrintWindow to false? That way, we could activate the hack of our choice depending on the OS and configuration without having to alter the SWT sources. This would greatly help while waiting for a fix.

      <title>Add ability to specify additional prerequistes for non-custom build files</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: I20090528-2000

When custom build is used it is possible to add additional input files. It would be good to have this ability also for non-custom build files, i.e., files for which a tool is used. These files should be respected within the dependency graph of CDT. This feature is useful in a custom build setting, in which a source file is generated from a custom build file, which in turn is needed for the non-custom build file. Build variables should be supported to support different configurations.

Ideally, one could select the inputfile from all available output files to make this more convienent.

From the command line do the following (I misinterpreted the meaning of the -list argument):

eclipsec.exe -application org.eclipse.equinox.p2.director -list http://download.eclipse.org/releases/helios

This produces the following error:

      <description>I20100125-1800

1. Make a Java file like the one below.
2. Invoke Ctrl+Alt+H on v(), you'll get something like "w() : void - Test (2 matches)"
3. Window &gt; Preferences &gt; General &gt; Appearance &gt; Colors and Fonts &gt; Basic &gt; Counter Color
4. Change the colour to something else.
5. Hit 'Apply'. Nothing happens.
6. Hit 'OK'. Nothing happens.
7. Try invoking call hierarchy again to force a "refresh". No dice.

This seemed to work on Boris's Mac though.</description>

Run the following from the command line:

eclipsec.exe -application org.eclipse.equinox.p2.director -m http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/updates/3.6-I-builds -list

This fails with:

Installation failed.
Unable to load repositories.

It is failing because I didn't specify any artifact repository, although this isn't needed for the -list command to work. If I use "-r" instead of "-m", it works just fine.</description>

      <title>Enhancement Request: Change the access level of function ClassicSQLNameStrategy.getEntityName() from private to protected</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: M20090917-0800

Teneo version: 1.1.2.v200912130725.

We have a special requirement that 1. can't use our own EntityNameStrategy to replace default EntityResolvingNameStrategy. 2. but while extending TeneoSQLNameStrategy, still needs to overwrite the behavior provided by the function ClassicSQLNameStrategy.getEntityName(). However this function is private right now.

Thus, is it possible to change the access level of function ClassicSQLNameStrategy.getEntityName() from private to protected, so it can be overwritten? 

Thanks

      <title>EDC is registering a service proxy from an invalid location</title>
      <description>The javadoc for TCF's IChannel.setServiceProxy(Class&lt;V&gt;, IService) say:

   "This method can be called only from channel open call-back."

EDC is calling it from within a launch sequence step, which disregards the requirement.

Eugene provided the following explanation of the requirement

"We don't allow registering service proxies at arbitrary time, because it
would require all clients to listen and react to service life-cycle
events. That would make clients more complicated and error prone without
providing significant benefits."</description>

As reported in bug 296631#c17 when tracing is disabled the corresponding listeners are not notified.  As a result the performance impact of tracing code being executed is (mostly) hit - only the code to write the trace string to a file is not done.  I will attach a patch that can be used to correct this problem.

      <description>I20100126-0100

Eclipse doesn't start on Solaris Sparc and Solaris x86 when the launcher is used (it crashes with a segmentation fault). If you copy over the old M4 launcher library (eclipse_1304.so) into the plugins/org.eclipse.equinox.launcher.gtk.solaris[verison]/ directory, eclipse will launch again.

We believe this is caused by the changes made to the launcher to support file associations.</description>

patch to remove some capabiltiy bundles

See bug 299344 for reference. 

This patch will remove bundles that were previously built by the Galileo builder. Once the Helios build is changed to no longer build them, the EPP build will break, without this (temporary) fix. 

Later, I will need to determine if the bundles need to go back in this feature (as the WTP ones are) or if I need to copy/paste capability information into our jee capabilities plugin, as I do for Eclipse SDK.</description>

      <title>[ui] filtering the "installed new software" list appears to stop due to wait on load job</title>
      <description>Build id: I20100126-0100, WinXP

While verifying bug 298806, I noticed long lags where the filter box is unresponsive (you can type, but events are ignored and the eraser is not shown).

It is expected that there is a window of time where filter events are ignored (while the repo is loading), but the window seems too long.

I have been clearing out all my p2 repo caches to test other bugs, so the problem seems much more severe.

I think that the load job triggered by the filter box should be more selective.  For example, it should only load the repo in question, not all of them.  It should also set a higher priority for itself so that it doesn't get blocked by other parallel load jobs that are loading all repos.

Note that this behavior has not changed since 3.5.  I don't believe this to be a regression, but it's possible that the performance is worse, or that I just noticed it in the course of doing lots of repo adding/loading with clean caches.  Once the repositories are loaded, everything is fine.  (So, for example, if you are running with auto updates on, you wouldn't see this problem.)</description>

This is happening in the release tool wizard, on the page where you can see the changed files. There is a tree with files and folders in the upper half, and two StyledTexts in the lower half for the textual comparison.

1. Click on one of the files in the upper half. Lower half updates
2. Try to scroll the text

-&gt; Instead of scrolling, you instead drag the selected item from the tree (or, sometimes, you end up with a multi-selection in the tree)</description>

The reason is, some of the value type classes could be specified only in the OXM (xml overrides) xml elements or files, and the content of the xml overrides is not visible to webservice layer; ws layer cannot generate the &lt;xml-schema&gt; for these classes/packages because we do not aware of their existence.

This might be because I'm behind a proxy. The proxy settings in Eclipse are correctly maintained.

This could be done by creating an extension point instead of calling org.eclipse.birt.report.viewer.utilities.AppServerWrapper.
I will create a patch for this feature.

This way we could integrate the embedded JBoss AS, embedded Glassfish, Tomcat ...

      <title>Add a possibility to place BIRT OSGi engine out of BIRT web application</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: 

When deploying a BIRT application, the BIRT OSGi engine is placed within the application. It would be good if we could set BIRT so that the engine is somewhere in the file system. This would decrease BIRT applications for about 30 MB. 
I will create a patch.

      <title>[shared] Install area calculated incorrectly when launcher and framework not co-located</title>
      <description>A product that stores the launcher and eclipse.exe in a folder separate from the framework has run into a problem when running in shared mode. What happens is that we go to write the users bundle.info we end up calculating the location of the launcher bundles incorrectly from the information in shared bundle.info. On the next run this difference is recognized and we will redirect the user's install to use the shared bundles.info

The problem is in how simpleconfigurator manipulator calculates the install folder and subsequently the location of the launcher bundles when in shared mode. What needs to happen is that we the shared eclipse.ini to get the correct layout.</description>

      <title>[publisher] Convert PublisherResult to use IUMap</title>
      <description>Created attachment 157350 [details]
patch

John has created a helper class called IUMap which holds a collection of IUs and has optimizations for InstallableUnitQuery queries. We should take advantage of this class and one instance where it would be useful is in the PublisherResult class.

Note that in order to do this the IUMap class should be moved to a more "common" bundle where others can access it. (currently it resides in the metadata.repo bundle)

Attached is an initial patch for comments/review.</description>

      <description>The Mapped by combo is not being populated when switching between two 1-M mappings (in the Structure View) with MappedBy annotations in Java.

Upon first selection the Mapped by combo is populated, but if you then select another mapped 1-M in the structure, notice that the Mapped by combo is not populated.  If you then switch back to the first 1-M the same unpopulated behavior can be seen.

I can reproduce this 100% of the time on my machine.  Karen seems to have less success on her machine.</description>

      <title>Ability to define custom artifact location in managed build</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: 7.0.0.I201001150805

When one project depends on another, and the dependent project's build-artifact is set to an absolute path, Gmake always fails for the referencing project with a 'multiple target patterns' error.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create two projects 'a' and 'b', such that project 'a' references the active configuration of project 'b'.
2. Set project 'b's build-artifact to an absolute path, like C:/${ProjName}.lib.
3. Build project 'a'.
-&gt; Gmake fails for project 'a' with a 'multiple target patterns' error.

The GnuMakefileGenerator assumes the dependent build-artifact is always a relative path, and always prepends &lt;referenced_project_loc&gt;/&lt;referenced_config&gt;/ to it.

The attached patch fixes the makefile-generation to handle this scenario.</description>

      <title>templated builds fail to publish when releng failure</title>
      <description>For some reason, templated builds, such as for JSDT and JAXWS fail to publish any test results. It may occur only when a JUnit failure occurs? 

The "final" error message has to do with a releng test failure that started showing up when we did away with tests being in 'dropins' folder. 

    286 Caused by: /shared/webtools/tests/jsdt-R1.2.0-I/test.xml:80: 
    The following error occurred while executing this line:$

The issue, I realize now, is that the tempalted folders still do use the dropings folder. 

A general purpose solution would be best, even if templated folders eventually also do not use the dropins folder.</description>

      <title>ROV holding lock on file</title>
      <description>ROV is causing problems in CCS because it is holding a lock on the file. This results in the "Invalid File Format" error people see in CCS after rebuilding their application on Linux.

ROV uses an IOFReader instance to lookup static strings from the .out file. The object file reader opens the file for reading when you call 'parse'. To ensure that the OFReader doesn't maintain a lock on the file, you need to call 'close' after calling 'parse'. The OFReader will close the file, then reopen it temporarily whenever a string is retrieved.

'parse' does not automatically close the file at the end because some (theoretical) users of the OFReader (other than ROV and RTA) may not be concerned with the file handle, and may not want the overhead of closing and re-opening the file.

ROV was missing the call to 'close' after the call to 'parse'. This was causing the OFReader to maintain its handle on the file.</description>

      <description>When letting the inferior finish on its own, I sometimes see GDB 7.0 be automatically terminated but sometimes not.  With GDB 7.0 there is a new =thread-group-exited event.

- delegate.prepareItemSelected(item) is notified first, at the beginning of a selection change
- delegate.itemSelected(item) is notified last, at the end of a selection change</description>

      <title>IMasterDetailsDelegate - reduce calls to isChanged(...)</title>
      <description>Further reduce the calls to delegate.isChanged(...).

New ideas:

- ignore the "text" event - only "textAfter" is important
- ignore events generated from delegate.prepareItemSelected(...)
- ignore events generated from delegate.itemSelected(...)</description>

I got this error using I20100126-0800.

Possible steps to reproduce:
1) I installed the first jar inside the dropins folder.
2) I restarted Eclipse
3) I closed again and I replace the first jar with the second
4) I restarted. Everything looked good.
5) I upgraded to last I-build and then I got this exception.

1) I started up an existing workspace with this build. I had left the synchronize perspective open, but when I restarted the perspective was gone.

2) Opened the synchronize perspective

3) I clicked the button in the sync view to create a new synchronization.

4) On the first page of the wizard I chose "CVS synchronization", clicked Next.

-&gt; The wizard failed with a NullPointerException. At this point I was unable to synchronize anything so I had to shutdown. I am attaching the log which has many errors.</description>

      <title>"Open Declaration" (F3) Feature does not work when function is a variable assignment</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: M20090917-0800

When a function is set as the value of a variable
eg.:

proc foo {a b} {
   puts "$a $b"
}

set myProc foo &lt;-- pressing F3 on foo does not work

set arga   "bar"
set argb   "baz"

executeStep $myProc $arga $argb

The open declaration will not work unless it is enclosed in execution brackets[] or used to start a new line of code.

In the example I have shown here, the name of the procedure is to be passed in as an argument to another procedure.  
Our current TCL environment has on the order of 5,000 files using this format. (this is for tracking and reporting step level details for all execution of code).

For our particular environment the severity is MAJOR as this has a huge impact as our code declarations are inaccessible.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. create a valid procedure
2. set it as the value of a variable
3. mouseover the value from step 2 and press F3</description>

      <title>Recursive definition of Eclipse runtime option -arch</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: 

While building a man page for /usr/bin/eclipse, I found that your Eclipse runtime options documentation at:

http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/misc/runtime-options.html?view=co#osgiarch

has the -arch option recursively defined:

-arch &lt;architecture&gt; (OSGi)
equivalent to setting osgi.arch to &lt;architecture&gt;

then it describes that property as:

osgi.arch {-arch}
see -arch

which of course begs the question of what does -arch actually do.

(I'm led to believe -arch relates to the underlining architecture
of the machine running eclipse, but that's not obvious, as OSGi is
an architecture itself.)

      <title>jaxws standalone build fails</title>
      <description>It failed when got to the tests and said "org.eclipse.jst.ws.cxf.tests" not found. I think this was because of a "mismatch" ... jaxws was pre-reqing the M4 version of WTP, but that version of WTP doesn't work with the near M5 version of Platform (I think due to some APIs added to P2 that rippled into server tools). 

So, step 1 as to use last week's near M5 I-build of WTP as the pre-req. 

I think it still failed, but in a different way. 

Continuing to investigate.</description>

      <title>deadlock during junit test which calls Display.syncExec on additional thread</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: 20090920-1017

Our application runs a Jetty Server, and in response to some
POST http requests, opens an editor on a worker thread of the server
using Display.syncExec.
The test code for this function, using HTTPClient to post to localhost.
A deadlock occurs while running the junit test. The WorkbenchTestable Thread
is also calling Display.syncExec at the time of the deadlock.
My guess/analysis is that this is the cause of the deadlock.

(I am going to attempt to simplify the scenario)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have code that matches the RCP app description and test case under the details.
2. Run the junit plugin test (junit4), I suggest using the debugger.
3. It deadlocks. If using the debugger, you can suspend all the threads and inspect to guess at what's gone wrong.</description>

I'm not exactly sure what that means but 1) I think JUnit 4 is being used in the standalone build, and JUnit 3 _might_ be being used in the massive WTP build. More important, 2) I did find reference to this problem on the internet. You might search or start at this following link to get some insight into the issue:

      <title>wrong aspects shown for preferences</title>
      <description>if a reference is selected in the WE, the standard propertysheet displays the properties of the linked referenceableelement instead of the properties of the reference. This currently does not work for aspects, so that the aspects of the reference are shown instead of the aspects of the referenceableelements.
This could be handled by the following change in PropertyTabbedPropertySheetPage in the conf.we project:

					// TODO aspects marker
					// subselection = selection;
					EObject modelElement = (EObject) selectedObject;
					if (modelElement != null &amp;&amp; modelElement instanceof Reference)
					{
						modelElement = ((Reference) modelElement).getReference();
					}
					aspects = AspectManager.INSTANCE.getAspectInstances(modelElement);

      <title>Aspects are not refreshed for elements without annotation</title>
      <description>Build Identifier:  20090920-1017

If selecting an element in the workflow editor for which a profile was defined (and activated), all aspect properties are shown in the custom properties section  correctly. However, if the selection will be switched from an element with defined annotations to an element for which no profile was defined or activated the properties view still shows aspect information of the "old" element instead of showing an empty properties section.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Annotate a workflow element, e.g. Action A, for which a profile was defined and activated before
2. Switch your selection to an element, e.g. StructuredActivityNode B, for which no profile was defined
3. =&gt; The properties view shows the same aspect properties as for the first workflow element A</description>

      <title>History of file impossible to track when working with tags and branches</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: 20090920-1017

When looking at the history of a file (list of revisions) it is impossible to see the following information:
 - which revision was "tagged"
 - the changes that have been made to this file in a branch

This makes it extremely difficult to work with branches and merge changes back in the trunk, since you cannot see which changes were made in the branch from the history view or which changes have been released in which version (it is a good practice to tag a release in source control).

What I was thinking was an option, a little similar to "Stop on copy", but in the other way: it would be VERY nice to be able to keep track of the changes of copies of the file in the history view (so you would get all revisions of the file in the branch in the same history). This way you could as well see that the file has been copied as part of a "tag".

I don't know how difficult this is, and if this can be done only in subversive or requires support for it in subversion, but for my company, it is a really big problem (from that perspective, CVS is much better as you get the full history of the file, with tags and changes in branches).

When I first started up with this build, and AIOOBE in NavigationHistory.restoreState on startup reset the workbench layout.

I don't remember what other editors I had open before, but the topmost was a .java editor.

I suggest we remove the OPML support completely at this point. We can reinstate it later, should we feel the need to do so, but maintaining code that isn't used doesn't make anyone happy.</description>

      <title>Feature request: Include XSD types search dialog in the API</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: 20080921203356 (WST feature build ID)

It would be great if the functionality for selecting XSD types (and maybe elements) is included in the Web Tools API. Currently to use the dialog for searching XSD types, we refer to some internal classes, namely:

org.eclipse.wst.common.ui.internal.search.dialogs.ScopedComponentSearchListDialog in the org.eclipse.wst.common.ui plugin 

and 

org.eclipse.wst.xsd.ui.internal.editor.search.XSDTypesSearchListProvider from the org.eclipse.wst.xsd.ui plugin.

Is there a possibility to expose this functionality?

Regards,
Dinko

P.S. Also it would be great if the XSDTypesSearchListProvider could work only with XSDSchema(s) and does not require to provide also an IFile instance. Currently we have such usecase where we provide XSD schemas as search scope, but no IFile is available. In this case the null IFile instance causes a NPE to be printed (in the superclass constructor).

      <title>[api] The StringVariableSelectionDialog for core.variables should support filtering</title>
      <description>Build Id: Eclipse 3.6m4

The StringVariableSelectionDialog, which typically is behind a "Variables..." button in a number of places, currently displays all defined Eclipse variables.

This is problematic, because many variables are valid in certain contexts only. The ${build_project} variable, for instance, is only valid in context of external tool builders.

End users who are prompted to pick a variable from the StringVariableSelectionDialog get the impression that they can use all the variables -- and once they picked one that fails to work in their context, they do not understand why it fails to work.

Proposed solutions:
-------------------
1.) In the simplest case, the StringVariableSelectionDialog should allow
    product builders to explicitly hide variables which are known to fail 
    in the context where the "Variables..." button is used. For instance:

    svsd = new StringVariableSelectionDialog(parent);
    svsd.hide(new String[] { "build_project" });
    int code = dialog.open();

    This simple improvement would already allow product builders to get it
    right in a "closed" environment for the occurrences of a "Variables..."
    button that they can control.

2.) For more advanced and configurable environments, the
      org.eclipse.core.variables.dynamicVariables
    extension point should add an attribute that allows variable providers
    define a list of String context name in which the variable can be 
    resolved. Variables without context name are expected to be universally
    available (to provide backward compatibility). The
    StringVariableSelectionDialog can then support filtering by a list of
    context names that are known to work in the concrete situation.</description>

      <title>[api] The ${build_project} Eclipse variable fails for builders other than Ant/ExternalToolBuilder</title>
      <description>Build ID: Eclipse 3.6m4

The "${build_project}" Eclipse variable is documented to "return the location of the project currently being built".

But looking at how the corresponding variable resolver is implemented, it turns out that this can only work for builders that extend the ExternalToolBuilder.

This is a problem for consumers like the CDT Makefile Build. The CDT Makefile Build allows specifying the make command, and allows using Eclipse Variables when doing so. End Users may try using the "${build_project}" variable in order to use a shellscript as make command which is defined in the current project; but this currently fails since the CDT MakeBuilder extends IncrementalProjectBuilder, and not ExternalToolBuilder.

Suggested Solutions:
--------------------
1) As the simplest first step, documentation of the ${build_project} variable
   should be change to indicate that this only works for external tool builders,
   e.g. Ant (within the context of external tools).

2) Functionality should be refactored such that the IncrementalProjectBuilder 
   directly supports it. This should be relatively straightforward:
   1. Add package-private method InternalBuilder#setProject(IProject proj)
   2. In BuildManager line 627, add a call to currentBuilder.setProject(proj)
   3. Add public API InternalBuilder#getProject() to get the current project
   4. Refactor the build_project variable resolver to use the new API, and
      have it contributed by the core.resources plugin rather than the
      external tools plugin --&gt; voila, the variable is universally valid.

3) Only slightly related -- The StringVariableSelectionDialog which displays
   a list of available variables to the end user should support filtering,
   such that end users do not see variables which are known not to work 
   in a particular context. I have filed bug 300988 for this improvement.</description>

      <title>css support for number/date/string format</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: 2.5.1

Support for numberFormat / dateFormat / stringFormat in css styles would be helpful.

I have reports which contain dozens of tables and each table can contain about a dozen detail fields with numbers. I want to define a number format for these number fields. As it is now I have to specify the format for each and every number field. If I have to change the format, I have to adapt the format specification of each and every field again.

With the visual report editor I can specify a format only at data field level, but not on a higher level. In the xml view I can copy a format definition and apply it to the table element. The table cells and the contained data fields inherit the format from the table element. This gives me some relief, but still it is not possible to do this in the visual editor, only in the xml editor.

Even better would be if I can specify a format at report or page level. I also tried this in the xml tab of the report editor, but when I try to switch to a different tab it gives me an error that I have to correct the xml first.

Finally I would like to be able to specify the format in an external css file. For now I get a Error.StyleSheetParserException.PROPERTY_NOT_SUPPORTED

      <title>AbstractPartRenderer's API-ness is ambiguous</title>
      <description>AbstractPartRenderer seems to be a class that should be API but it's currently in an API package. It's also in a bundle that depends on SWT when it has no SWT dependencies itself. SWTPartRenderer, which _is_ API, extends it, but it does not override all of its methods which causes a leaking of internal methods.

APR should either be made API or SWTPR should reimplement all of its methods (even if blank) like how it is with Job and InternalJob so that the methods are documented properly and not exposed to subclasses because of a "leak".

While we're at it, it may be worth renaming these two classes because they're not exactly about rendering "parts".</description>

      <title>Team actions do not provide a RemoteResourceMappingContext to ResourceMappings</title>
      <description>Build Identifier: M20090917-0800

Subversive's Team context menu actions (such as CommitAction/UpdateAction) don't provide a RemoteResourceMappingContext for determining the relevant remote state of the model resources. Although some ResourceMappings don't need to worry about a context supplied to the getTraversals method, there are those that crucially depend on the remote context's availability.

Imagine a 'Forms' logical container element which maps to all *.form files in a given folder. Let's assume that some of the element's files were deleted and then Commit action is invoked on the element. If a remote context is not provided, the element's ResourceMapping will only consider resources that exist locally in the workspace. Therefore, deleted files will not be included in the commit operation. Similarly, update operation on the element will not include any new files from the repository. In other words, if a remote context is not provided, team operations on the logical model elements may exclude resources. (See http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/platform-team/team3.1/logical-physical-mappings.html for a detailed discussion)

A real (although somewhat contrived) example of a ResourceMapping that uses the remote context is o.e.jdt.internal.corext.util.JavaElementResourceMapping.PackageFragmentResourceMapping. It uses the context to determine all IFolders inside the package that don't correspond to any of the package's subpackages.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Checkout the org.eclipse.team.examples.filesystem project from dev.eclipse.org:/cvsroot/eclipse into a 'host' workspace. Lauch a 'child' workbench to debug it.
2. In the child workbench open a 'Project Explorer' view.
3. Create a new 'Model Project' (File -&gt; New -&gt; Other -&gt; Team Logical Model Example -&gt; Model Project) and share it (Team -&gt; Share Project... -&gt; SVN). 
4. Create a MOD file in the project ('Create MOD file' in the project's context menu).
5. Create a MOE file for the MOD file ('Create MOE file' in the MOD file's context menu).
6. Commit the changes.
7. Now delete the MOE file ('Delete' in the context menu).
8. Invoke Commit action on the MOD file.
9. Notice that the list of resources to commit contains only the modified MOD 
file and doesn't contain the deleted MOE file. If you are to commit the changes, the MOE file will NOT be deleted from the repository.</description>
