      <title>Text selection in address bar or "add to bookmark" dialog does not behave naturally (for me, IE user)</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.5a) Gecko/20030728 Mozilla Firebird/0.6.1 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.5a) Gecko/20030728 Mozilla Firebird/0.6.1 I just tried FireBird today and the first thing that shocked me is that when you try to 'select' an already selected text in the URL bar or the 'Add to bookmark' dialog, firebird goes into drag&amp;drop mode instead of 'reselect' mode. To reselect I have to click first (click down then up) and then select. That's two clicks more than under IE and it's really annoying as, of course, the first thing i do when opening a browser is to reselect the URL just after the "www." to enter the URL that interests me. Also really annoying in the "Add to bookmark" dialog: I usually shorten the name of the bookmark by selecting over the old selection... I can see why the drag&amp;drop mode is useful for the address bar (to do a quick bookmark in the "bookmark toolbar"), but in the "Add to bookmark" dialog???? I know it doesn't sound like a real deal but when you are accustomated to a behavior, it's hard and painful to change... I know I will keep IE for now... Acceptable solution: An "IE style" option in the preferences that would copy the behavior of IE, or remove the "selected on getfocus" behavior of the input field (but that would also break an expected behavior) If solution 1: maybe allowing drag and drop on at least the little 'blank page' icon that is on the left of the URL... Hope somebody has time to do this... I really like firebird but this thing keeps bothering me and hurts my surf speed... Thanks! Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Goto any page 2. Click on the url in the address bar (=&gt; gets selected) 3. Try to select a part of the url without first clicking to deselect 4. Doesn't work 5. Wonder about how many clicks it takes to get what you want done 6. Wonder what would be the use of drag&amp;drop in the "Add to bookmark" dialog Actual Results: Drag&amp;drop (See 'details', sorry i wrote everything in that box) Expected Results: Select text (Like IE)</description>

      <title>Duplicate bookmarks allowed</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.5a) Gecko/20030728 Mozilla Firebird/0.6.1 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.5a) Gecko/20030728 Mozilla Firebird/0.6.1 User is allowed to use the same title for multiple bookmarks. A user can name all of their pages "Hominy Grits" if he/she wants to. This may be by design. However, it has caused me confusion a number of times since I often re-name links to friendly names and have used duplicate names. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Save a page as a bookmark (use unique name) 2. Browse to a different page 3. Save page as bookmark with same unique name Actual Results: Both (identical) bookmarks are allowed Expected Results: A message like "A bookmark with that title already exists...ok?" or something</description>

      <title>Add ability to double click on the url in the Blocked Popups and launch the URL.</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.5b) Gecko/20030917 Firebird/0.6.1+ Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.5b) Gecko/20030917 Firebird/0.6.1+ When you visit a page that has a blocked pop-up and then you go to the Blocked Popups dialogue, there is no way to launch that URL apart from unblocking the site. I suggest allowing the user to double click on that URL in the Blocked Popups dialog in order to launch that URL. The function could be as simple as just launching that URL in a new window, or it could be even better designed so that it remembers the parameters of the function call including the window name and additional parameters like width, height, scrollbar, etc...

      <title>No Theme Selection Not Available on CSS sites that don't offer alternate stylesheets</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.5) Gecko/20030925 Firebird/0.7 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.5) Gecko/20030925 Firebird/0.7 Going to a site that offers alternate style sheets in Thunderbird .7 is great... If I want, I can easily see how a the page might look in a non-css browser by choosing the No Theme option in the Firebird Style Sheet Selector. However, if I go to a site that is CSS-based, but happens not to offer a alternate style sheet, the style selector is not available and the No Theme option is, hence, = not available for selecting. Can the Style Sheet Selector be available when I'm at a CSS-based page that happens to not offer an alternate style sheet, then I could select No Theme on those sites as well. Ps. The Style Selector Extension currently offers such functionality and the lack of No Theme selectability on non-alt style sites is the only reason I'm using two practically duplicate components. Thanks in advance. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce:</description>

But I miss a feature to search through the folders to find the folder where you want to store the new bookmark. I think it would also be nice to be able to create a new folder directly there. Like entering a path with one more folder or so. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Click on "Bookmarks" in the Main View in the menu. 2. Click on "Add to Bookmarks" Actual Results: You see the Dialog where this new feature should be. Expected Results: see description -</description>

      <title>users transitioning to Firebird need a confirmation option for close application button</title>

If you have this reflex built in, tabbed links are entirely useless :-( A solution: a preference that causes a pop-up window to ask for confirmation on closing the application. For those who keep their browers open for a long time, this would not be too obnoxious. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Fill Firebid with lots of tastey tabbed links to look at 2. Accidently hit close window due to old browser reflex Actual Results: Application terminates, along with all your saved tabbed links, forcing you to reconstruct from memory the list of links you were going to read. Expected Results: Allow (through a preference) asking for confirmation on close.</description>

      <title>password manager does not appear to support multiple entries for the same site</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.5) Gecko/20030925 Firebird/0.7 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.5) Gecko/20030925 Firebird/0.7 In the http://www.nationstates.net site, when one enters multiple logins, password manager does not launch a dialog prompting the user to select which login to use as in the Mozilla Suite. This may or may not be related to the fact that the login part is in a different frame. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Visit nationstates.net. 2. Enter a random login and password in the relevant fields. 3. When password manager prompts to save the login, click yes. 4. Repeat steps 2 and 3. Actual Results: Firebird did not fill in the login fields at all. Expected Results: Firebird should have prompted the user to choose a login.</description>

      <title>Easy to use file-open from command line (like galeon -w myfile.html)</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.5a) Gecko/20030728 Mozilla Firebird/0.6.1 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.5a) Gecko/20030728 Mozilla Firebird/0.6.1 After switching from galeon to Firebird I miss the ability to open the file within the running browser using command like galeon -w myfile.html galeon -w docs/index.html etc. The problem has two parts in Firebird 1) No clean equivalent to -w option (open in existing browser or start the new one if there is no such) One can workaround it writing scripts like #!/bin/sh MOZILLA=/usr/local/bin/MozillaFirebird $MOZILLA -remote "ping()" &amp;&amp; $MOZILLA -remote "openURL($@, new-window)" &amp;&amp; exit 0 #if we're here, open a new process. $MOZILLA "$@" but the problem is so frequent that one could integrate the solution into mozilla. Especially considering the fact, that mozilla presents very stupid dialog-box while the second instance is being started. 2) No local paths handling Running command like MozillaFirebird myfile.html results in opening some web address a bit similar to the file name. To get the expected reply one need to write MozillaFirebird file://`pwd`/myfile.html what is far harder to write. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Create or find some html file on your drive 2. Try opening it using MozillaFirebird test.html 3. Keep the previous mozilla running and try MozillaFirebird test2.html Actual Results: 2. Mozilla reported that http://www.test.html does not exist 3. Mozilla asked me which profile I want (???) Expected Results: Open the files given. Both in the same instance.</description>

      <title>Option to override text in search bar when using drag and drop</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.5a) Gecko/20030728 Mozilla Firebird/0.6.1 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.5a) Gecko/20030728 Mozilla Firebird/0.6.1 I often find a word or phrase on a webpage I wish to search for with a site in my search toolbar. If I highlight the phrase and drag it on the toolbar it can only go before, in front of, or in between any text that is already there, meaning I have to edit the search box before doing a search. I think a good enhancement would be that, if text is dragged onto the search bar as it goes over any existing text, that text is highlighted so it will be replaced if the text is 'dropped' over it. A user could still drop the text either side of any existing text, but it will make it much easier to do quick searches in the toolbar. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

Mozilla, OTOH, opens the supplied URL in the current tab. Both beheviors are useful, but neither is what _I_ want: I want a NEW tab in the CURRENT window. Is it possible to add a user option to enable the behavior I want? thanks. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.type http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/ in the command window 2.new FB window appears 3.type the same again 4.another window appears Actual Results: I get 2 new windows Expected Results: two new tabs in an existing window</description>

      <title>Support for multiple firebird processes</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.5) Gecko/20031007 Firebird/0.7 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.5) Gecko/20031007 Firebird/0.7 It would be very nice if Firebird supported the ability to run multiple Firebird processes (as an option). There are times when I'm doing some important bit of work on a web page (say, filling out a long and complicated form), and I want to eliminate the risk that navigating to another page in another browser window might cause me to lose the work I've done in the first. If, for example, the browser crashes or hangs due to a bug, or a bug in a plug-in kills the browser, or an OS resource limitation on a stressed machine causes browser problems, then I've lost my work in the original window. Being able to protect against that by launching an additional browser process can be a very handy thing. This is especially true while the browser is in early development, like now, but even once it's released it would continue to be useful. An extensible application like Firebird is at risk from 3rd party plugins, no matter how solid the Firebird code is. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

This feature should work like the popup blocking provided by google toolbar 2.0 for internet explorer. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Enter a new URL 2. Hold down CTRL key while the page is loaded. 3. This URL must open some popup window that I want to see, but I don't want to disable popup blocking for this page *always*, only for this time Actual Results: The page is loaded and popup is blocked. Expected Results: The popup must not be blocked, as I'm holding CTRL key down. If I load the same page again, but not holding CTRL key down, the default action should be taken (popup blocked, or not if it is in the "white list").</description>

      <title>PROPOSED: The Thunderbird mailbox-tree handler should be the model for the bookmarks handler</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.6a) Gecko/20031002 Firebird/0.7+ Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.6a) Gecko/20031002 Firebird/0.7+ I've previously pinged on the difficulty of creating a heierarchy of folders in the bookmarks. I was 'defeated' by the principal of least-surprise. So, I'm going to relate this to an existing function: there will be less surprise still if two tree-view controls behave basically the same. 1) The Thunderbird Folder Tree allows "New Subfolder / Rename Folder / Delete Folder / Search / Properties" on the rightmouse -- all of these are appropriate and, IMNSHO, valuable functions for the bookmarks folder. 2) The Thunderbird NewFolder dialog, even when called from SelectFolder=&gt; NewSubfolder, allows for changing the parent - it only nominates the selected item. Again, very very useful while storing a bookmark. And, only slightly off topic, PLEASE give us a "NewFolder" button on the AddToBookmarks dialog - it's a terrible waste of time to navigate down a tree and then find the folder category you're targeting hasn't been created. An excellent model is the FilterProperties dialog in Thunderbird. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce:</description>

It would be great if when your mouse was over the images for example you could increase the size of the picture by actuating the wheel when pressing control, like changing the size of text on the page. Often changing the size of the picture on the page would ruin the formatting, so you could have an image of the picture overlaid on top of the real picture, not a window as such with decorations, but just the enlarged images sticks above the image. This would dissapear when the control key was released. This could be done like when viewing characters in windows character map. FireBird rocks!

This behavior is unfriendly. Instead, Firebird should present notification (through a sound or through some visual mechanism), but not require acknowledgement. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Go to (for example) www.kjsdkdj.car Actual Results: A dialog appears "www.kjsdkdj.car could not be found. Please check the name and try again." Expected Results: A non-dialog notification would be good. A solution to this would be a solution to Bug 218043, but that bug is not identical to this. I believe that the Find feature also presents this behavior when a term cannot be found. That is less of an issue.</description>

      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322) Build Identifier: This icon is intended to solve a number of issues: - Currently, Mozilla Firebird has a nondescript icon. - The current proposed icon (see http://www.actsofvolition.com/steven/mozillabranding/) , while attractive and professional, brands the product as "firebird" (note the "F"). Going forward, Mozilla Browser, the new name for Mozilla Firebird, will need an icon that both describes what it does and brands it as a Mozilla.org application. - Windows XP uses true color icons, up to 48x48 pixels in size. It also uses 32x32 pixel icons, 24x24 pixel icons(Start Menu), and 16x16 pixel icons. Simply resizing the image results in an unreadable blur. The icons *must* be hand-hinted so that they are clear at small sizes. - Mac OS X uses 128x128 pixel icons. They are resized in real time. Any icon *must* fit the Mac OS X visual style. The icon must also be similar enough (or the same as) the Windows icon to signify that the program is indeed the same as the Windows version. - GNOME and KDE accept either scaled PNG images or SVG. SVG icons are ideal as they are clearer at larger sizes. Any icon developed must be vectorized to facilitate the transition to SVG. I have created an icon that I believe fits all of this criteria. It is simple yet universially recognizable. The user immediately knows that the product is in fact a web browser, and the "M" logo is included to signify that it is a Mozilla.org product. The icon is vectorized (EPS and Macromedia Flash) and is rendered in six sizes, from 16x16 to 128x128. Below 64x64, the icon is hand- hinted to add more clarity and detail. Even at 16x16 pixels it is clear that the application is both a web browser and a Mozilla.org application. You can view a preview at of the different sizes: http://cwcairns.home.comcast.net/preview.png Or, download the RGBA PNG images and vector source at: http://cwcairns.home.comcast.net/globe.zip Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce:</description>

The icons *must* be hand-hinted so that they are clear at small sizes. - Mac OS X uses 128x128 pixel icons. They are resized in real time. Any icon *must* fit the Mac OS X visual style. The icon must also be similar enough (or the same as) the Windows icon to signify that the program is indeed the same as the Windows version. - GNOME and KDE accept either scaled PNG images or SVG. SVG icons are ideal as they are clearer at larger sizes. Any icon developed must be vectorized to facilitate the transition to SVG. I have created an icon that I believe fits all of this criteria. It is simple yet universially recognizable. The user immediately knows that the product is in fact a web browser, and the "M" logo is included to signify that it is a Mozilla.org product. The icon is vectorized (EPS and Macromedia Flash) and is rendered in six sizes, from 16x16 to 128x128. Below 64x64, the icon is hand- hinted to add more clarity and detail. Even at 16x16 pixels it is clear that the application is both a web browser and a Mozilla.org application. You can view a preview at of the different sizes: http://cwcairns.home.comcast.net/preview.png Or, download the RGBA PNG images and vector source at: http://cwcairns.home.comcast.net/globe.zip Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce:</description>

It should only respond to and be labeled as cmd+a. -View&gt;Sidebar&gt;Bookmarks responds to both cmd+b and cmd+i, but is labeled as cmd+i.

Perhaps reimplementing the sidebar as it was, but adding the page holder as a tab, something similar to what M$IE 5 for Mac does. One could drag the page's favicon to the pageholder tab for it to remain loaded there, for example. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1) Build Identifier: Firebird 0.6.1 I know Mozilla and Firebird one of those browsers that support tabs... Beautifully :D Yet, if you see another browser with a similar feature, Opera, you will remark that in the browser preferences there is an option: whether new "windows" should be by default open in tabs or seperate windows... Why not to put such in option in "The" Mozilla and Mozilla Firebird? Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce:</description>

Where that browser could not contact the uri entered or, if the uri is not valid, it will transmit the uri to the web portal branch of the browser provider and perform a web search. I am informed that this feature can be deactivated in the advanced preferences dialogue pane for this browser. I was unhappy when switching from Mozilla Seamonkey to Mozilla Firebird that the search from location bar feature had been replaced. Instead of having the choice between different engines and being directed to the search results page I am forced to use google and sent to the first result page (I didn't realise exactly what it was doing at first). The more worrying 'features' are that, unlike SeaMonkey, you do not explitly perform the search and I could not find a way to turn this off. What I think Firebird should do differently as soon as possible: - Give the user the option to disable this feature from the standard preferences dialogue box (Tools -&gt; Options...) - Tell the user, when they enter their first malformed URL, what will happen and maybe give them a box with buttons labelled: [Submit to Google] [Cancel Search] [Disable Feature] What Firebird might do eventually: - Allow the user to configure an arbitary "Quick Search" bookmark as the target for the malformed URL searches. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: The automatic search from the location bar can be reconfigured using the preferential extension. It can be disabled [pref("keyword.enabled", ...)] or have the search URL changed [pref("keyword.URL", ...)].</description>

Additionally, by holding down the Shift key, it opens in a new window. I was using the View Image feature today, and tried using CTL to force it into a new tab. It didn't work of course, however, I think this might be a useful feature. Thus, I propose that pressying CTRL and clicking on "View Image" in the context menu should open the image in a new tab. Also, by pressing SHIFT and clicking "View Image" in the context menu, it should open a new window. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce:</description>

If Moz has to decode it and spit it into a screen buffer it should be simple enough to get any sort of image to save as a .bmp. It would make life easier for those of us who pull images down for editing, it would save us an extra step of conversion, and it's a feature 'the best browser in the world' should have. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Find pretty picture on web. 2. right-click, save image as... 3. savebox displays with 'type' field Actual Results: Image can only be saved in the format it's recieved in.

Anyway, oftentimes I want to page down or search within the main web page pane of the window. The annoying thing is there's no reliable way to focus the main window short of clicking it with the mouse. Tab will cycle through but you're never sure if you've got focus, there's no visual indication (which would be nice too). I love how you can press Ctrl-L to reliably get to the location bar. There should be another simple shortcut that gives the main window focus. It should *not* focus on a form field but on the page itself. Focusing on the first form field is a separate operation; it would mean anytime the page has a form field (which is often) I'd still be stuck with clicking. Thanks for your work on free software. Cheers, Matthew. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

      <title>Options-Themes: add an apply button and make doubleclick apply the selected theme</title>
      <description>Is there a reason we don't have an apply button in Options-Themes? There are even localization strings, but no code for this. I implemented it and it works fine (tested with Orbit Blue and Bluemonkey). Left to the "uninstall %theme_name%" button is an "apply %theme_name%" button. Doubleclicking a theme now applies it. This is very convenient because you can click through all your themes and see how they look like. Maybe selecting a theme and clicking OK shouldn't change the theme as it does now? That would be one line to comment out/remove if we wanted it.</description>

IMO those attempt is just as annoying as unsolicited popup, for they can be easily turned down by disabling JavaScript. If there's option to always enable right-click context menu as one of Web Features options, it'll be as useful as popup-blocking. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce:</description>

      <title>throbber should not load mozilla.org if throbber is animated (i.e. another page is trying to load)</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.5) Gecko/20031007 Firebird/0.7 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.5) Gecko/20031007 Firebird/0.7 This bug is a minor enhancement request. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Enter the URL for a slow web site. 2. While the slow page is loading, the throbber will be animated. 3. Click on the animated throbber. Actual Results: The slow page is unloaded before it successfully loads and the browser loads mozilla.org. Expected Results: If the browser is busy trying to load a page, the animated throbber should not allow the current page to be unloaded (and replaced with the mozilla.org page).</description>

      <title>Hint for scrolling when less than 1 full page could be scrolled</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.6b) Gecko/20031018 Firebird/0.7+ Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.6b) Gecko/20031018 Firebird/0.7+ (Please update summary if necessary. I can't think of a good way to express this in one line.) Near the end of a document, PageDown may not actually be able to move a full page down. However, nothing happens to show this happened, nor where the user's attention should now be focused on the page. As a result, the user must interrupt their reading to search through the text to find their place again. There should be some hint about where the bottom of the page used to be. I believe I've seen this feature somewhere before, but I cannot remember where. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Scroll to half a page from the end of a scrolling document. 2. Press PageDown, or click the appropriate trough on the scrollbar. Actual Results: The page scrolls with no indication of how far it went. Expected Results: Displayed a hint of where the old bottom of the page moved to, for example a thin line of white XOR'ed with the content that faded after a short time (~0.5 seconds perhaps.) I have smooth scrolling off, but with it on, lines move too fast for me to follow well. I don't think slowing down the scroll speed is right, because that would make it painfully slow in general usage.</description>

Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. If I build deep pages that are centered 2. 3. Actual Results: The table that is centered jumps over to the left Expected Results: I know it is compensating for less room because of the scrollbar being there, but I think it should always reserve space for the scrollbar so there isn't this inconsistancy on how the pages look. The available screen should be the same regardless of scrollbars.</description>

IE's Google Toolbar does this and it is a nice convenience. This feature enhancement would reduce keystrokes and allow users to reuse the same search terms in different search engines without typing. I reported this bug against Mycroft on the mozdev.org Bugzilla: http://mozdev.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=5039. They told me to report it here. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. CTRL+K and type some words to search for, but do NOT press ENTER 2. Click the search engine drop-down list and select a non-default search engine Actual Results: Nothing happens. You have to press ENTER to start the search. Expected Results: Auto-search like IE's Google Toolbar.</description>

      <title>bookmarks manager should have two-pane interface for easier filing of bookmarks into folders</title>
      <description>Sufficiently large bookmark lists are hard to organize because of the scrolling required to move each bookmark into the appropriate folder. For a bookmark list like mine, with a bunch of folders at the top and a bunch of uncategorized bookmarks underneath them, organizing my list requires: 1. clicking on a bookmark; 2. drag-scrolling it up to the top of the list; 3. dropping it into the appropriate folder; 4. scrolling back down to the next uncategorized bookmark. This chore would be much easier if there were a second pane in the manager which displayed just the hierarchy of folders. Then, bookmarks from the list could be dragged over to the folder tree and into the appropriate folders without the need for any scrolling, requiring only: 1. clicking on a bookmark; 2. dragging it over to the appropriate folder; 3. dropping it.</description>

      <title>RFE: Make auto-scroll more configurable, i.e. speed, acceleration</title>

(Espcially when the text spans the entire width of the page and is of a highly technical nature or is poorly written.) The ability to set minimum and maximum scroll speeds as well as the distance increments that determine when to move up to the next speed would give auto scroll more use than just scanning through a page or quickly jumping around. It's just a number... bury it in about:config if you must but please let us change it. Thanks for reading. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Middle-click to initiate auto-scroll. 2. Move mouse down ever so slightly until the page begins scrolling. 3. Read the page as it crawls by. Actual Results: Middle-click again to stop the auto-scroll when the text you are trying to read is scrolling off the top of the window. Expected Results: Ability to set the speed range of auto-scroll to span from "slow" to "laughably slow" to make it easy to hone in on a speed that allows me to keep the line I am currently reading near the center or the bottom of the page.</description>

Thank you. This is great. However, the A HREF srrounding those images is still functional. The result is that I often find myself clicking on innocent looking white space in order to bring the window into the foreground and discovering that I am being sent to the advertiser's site. In some ways this is more annoying than seeing the images. A toggle option in the preferences that would allow the suppression of links that contain blocked images would be great. Links that wrap more stuff (an ad image AND some text, for example) can safely be blocked entirely by this option, I think. Thanks for all your hard work. Firebird has brought my Windows box one step closer to using Microsoft only for its OS and my Linux box one step closer to replacing it entirely. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Block images from an ad server 2. Reload the page 3. Click where the ad should be Actual Results: See details Expected Results: See details</description>

It would be nice if firebird had the option to open these new windows as new tabs instead of completely separate windows. Without this I often find I get loads of windows open, then have to close them all, which leads to me accidentally closing windows with several tabs open and losing data (which happens without a prompt in firebird! see separate bug).

This provides the user two ways to get back to the parent page: hit the back button and then the forward button, or hit reload (which is not obvious as a method until bug 157004 is resolved). If the parent page was the first page in the session history, the first method isn't available. Once bug 157004 is fixed another method would be to highlight the location bar and hit enter. Another, possible, method would be for the error page to provide an HTML link back to the parent page. However, all of these latter solutions are technically flawed - they cause the parent page to be unconditionally re-fetched. This is especially troublesome if the parent page had some side-effect (e.g. it was the results page of sending an e-mail message or posting a comment to a weblog). The easiest solution is for the HTML error page to appear in the session history. It is obviously a web page (witness bug 157004), and I personally think it is the most intuitive behavior. The only argument against I can see is that it destroys the session's forward history; however the user was expecting this anyhow as soon as they clicked on the error-generating link. The only other correct solution is for there to be a link to the parent page which does NOT cause a re-fetch. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce:</description>

However, drooling around and checking every few days whether there has been an update or not is pretty tiresome. What would be extremely nice would be an option to monitor a bookmark for a change: If selected, the current page has to be saved somewhere by Firebird. Now every few days (should be adjustable), Firebird automatically (or triggered manually, where Firebird could give the user a hint) looks at that page in the background (without opening it) and checks whether the html has been changed. This will not work for pages like news-sites, but it may be cool for all those other pages that only update once in a while and of which a user wants to stay updated of. Eg. www.mozilla.org, www.kde.org, etc. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: not applicable Actual Results: not applicable Expected Results: not applicable not applicable</description>

Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Download a Firebird build 2. Extract to any directory 3. Run MozillaFirebird.exe I found this out while I was trying to run Firebird from a network partition, designated as Y:\. While I could get certain settings to be saved on the network partition, there was always something saved on the local machine. This was a problem when logging in to other machines, which would then always create a new profile on the local hard drive and, specificall, on C:\. I was attempting to get it to save every bit of data on Y:\ so it wouldn't matter which machine Firebird ran on, it would always keep its settings.</description>

      <title>Add a global preference for extension install location</title>

I believe this is an overly technical question to most people. What's worse is that the question is answered inconsistently: "OK" means to install to the app dir for about half of the extensions, while it means to install to the profile dir for the other half. Please provide a simple checkbox for "Install extensions to profile directory" so that this question can be answered once and for all, simplifying the install process for most users by removing what is often the only question asked (aside from the Software Installation prompt. I have a moderate preference that the checkbox default indicate that extensions be installed in the app dir, so bad/outdated extensions do not persist across Firebird re-installs/upgrades. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Install any extension from http://texturizer.net/firebird/extensions/</description>

      <title>Drag link/text anywhere to open/search - Super / Magic drag &amp; drop support (like MyIE2 &amp; GoSuRF)</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; MyIE2; .NET CLR 1.1.4322) Build Identifier: - I'm missing a feature in Firebird which is being missed by quite a few people, seeing the various forum topics on the subject: "Super Drag &amp; Drop" or "Magic Drag" This feature is incorporated in the IE shell extensions of MyIE2 (http://www.myie2.com/html_en/tour/03superdragdrop.htm) and GoSuRF (http://mmjd.com/gosurf/tour/?en - Items 13 &amp; 14). Basically it allows you to select any link and drag it anywhere, after which it will open the link in a new tab in the background; OR select any text and drag it anywhere, after which it will search for the text in Google and open the results in a new tab in the background. If the selected text is a URL (without A tag), it will just open the URL in the background. I realize this is possible in Firebird by dragging the links to an open space on the tabbar or to the toolbar/go button, but if you have ever used these options in MyIE2 and/or GoSuRF, you know there is a huge difference. It is so much easier doing it their way. Saves a lot of hassle and you can do it blindly (which is probably the biggest reason to choose for this method). It can also be turned off (which is important) or enhanced: by dragging a selection of text or images, you can let these selections automatically be saved to a previously chosen folder. This is my reason not to switch to Firebird at all, while I would really like to. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3. Actual Results: Not supported. Expected Results: Explained above. An extension would be a solution, I'm not sure if this should be a default behavior for Firebird. There is no such extension available however and it's VERY useful. I find myself using this almost anywhere (then finding out it's not possible).</description>

I am all for user control of what I download to the browser, but these pop-ups are not only annoying but dangerous. If I disable JavaScript, I can't use Bugzilla. That won't work. How about disabling the Java-Script pop-up instead? We have a pop-up blocker and it is evidently not blocking all pop-ups. You should fix it to block JavaScript pop-ups too. Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce Steps to Reproduce: 1. Go to DrudgeReport 2. Watch JavaScript pop-up prompt you Expected Results: Mozilla should block the pop-up.</description>

      <title>Floating bookmarks window (or maybe fine-tuned Bookmarks Manager)...</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.5) Gecko/20031007 Firebird/0.7 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.5) Gecko/20031007 Firebird/0.7 In short: I'd love to have something like bookmarks sidebar but floating. Below the longer discussion. Firebird offers currently 3 methods of opening bookmarked page - finding it in the bookmarks menu - displaying left side bookmarks sidebar and clicking there - displaying bookmarks manager and clicking inside it All of those have important (for me) limitations: - selecting right bookmark from the menu is a bit hard, especially for person possessing 500 bookmarked pages in many categories... - sidebar takes a lot of space horizontal space, forcing the viewed pages to be narrowed and fairly often forcing me to use horizontal scrollbar - bookmarks manager uses a lot of screen space for menu, toolbar and unnecessary columns like location and description (yes, they can be disabled but then this information is lost when I really want to edit the bookmarks - where those columsn and buttons are nice), moreover there is no shortcut to show/hide it I would love to have a way to have 'floating bookmarks sidebar displayed/hidden with simple shortcut'. It could be achieved with one of the two methods: a) Allowing bookmarks sidebar to float (via taking 'Bookmarks' title and dragging it with a mouse), after such an operation one could get some 'always on top of firebird' window - of course still keeping the ability to hidden it with Ctrl-B and to redisplay it in the same position/state with next Ctrl-B b) Allowing Bookmarks Manager to be displayed and hidden with simple shortcut similar to Ctrl-B (with the rule that if I move it somewhere, hide, than within the short time display it again, it will reappear in the same position and state). Allowing one to disable the search line, the statusbar and if only possible even the main menu of the Bookmarks Manager window (using some right-click menu option to get the main menu back) Allowing one to configure different Bookmarks Manager appeareance when accessed as 'Bookmarks Float' and when accessed as 'Bookmarks Manager' (or maybe just giving the one-click method of changing this window appearence). Of course my ideas can be selected partially, show/hide/show again at the same place bookmark manager shortcut being the most important and probably easiest to implement.

      <title>Re-prompting for uninstalled plug-ins is annoying</title>

It would be wonderful if the prompt dialog had a check box that said "Do not prompt me about this plug-in again". When using the "Open in Tabs" in a folder full of bookmarks (a great feature that I use every day, BTW), I sometimes wind up with a whole stack of prompts that have to be cleared individually. Adding this feature might generate some confusion. If a user has previously declined to install a plug-in and then encounters a page where they would like the plug-in to work they may not be able to figure out what is wrong. Whether the user is confused or not, there needs to be another method of getting the plug-in downloaded at this point. One solution to this would be to display the information about the missing plug-in in some less invasive way, either right from the start or only after a user has once declined to install it. For example, a little button/link might be displayed on the broken page element that would raise the dialog box when clicked. Or, the broken element might be given a tooltip so that mousing over it would raise an explanation. Or, an icon/message might be displayed in the status bar to indicate that the page requires a missing-but-declined plug-in. With any of these solutions, the original dialog box where the user declined to install the plug-in could warn the user of what they will see in the future for that type, so they are better informed about what is going on. Thanks for all the great work that has gone into Firebird. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Use a browser without Shockwave Flash installed. 2. Go to: http://www.doonesbury.com/strip/dailydose/index.html, observe the prompt 3. Reload the page. Observe the prompt again.</description>

      <title>Add Bookmark: Move the 'bookmarkTree' in the menulist</title>
      <description>How about something else: Why not move the bookmarkTree itself into the dropdown selector of the 'create in'? Instead of combining three widgets (button, menulist and tree) in a new and strange way, we would create a new widget (menulist containing a tree) This also saves the extra 'twisty' button. The XUL for it is simple: &lt;menulist id="select-menu" oncommand="selectMenulistFolder(event);"&gt; &lt;menupopup&gt; &lt;bookmarks-tree id="folder-tree" flex="1" type="folders" seltype="single" persist="height" rows="10" onselect="selectTreeFolder();"/&gt; &lt;/menupopup&gt; &lt;/menulist&gt; Screenshot and a 'hacked' addBookmark2.xul will be attached soon. Note however, there are some issues to be solved: * The tree selection is offset (click in tree and see the item selected 2 or 3 lines higher) * The javascript probably also need to be adjusted * Selecting an item in the three should close the menupopup.</description>

I just now wanted this because I was reading the Ruby manual online, and wanted to move to the part of my FVWM2 virtual desktop that contains my emacs so I could try some stuff. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Be using a virtual desktop window manager 2. try to tear a tab off and drag it to the window of your choice 3. look all bummed because it didn't work.</description>

      <title>Create cookie manager ala Bookmark Manager</title>
      <description>IMHO it would be much better to put an entry for the cookie manager directly in the Tools menu, and improve it to be more like the bookmark manager (with search functionality for instance).</description>

How about ( :-) ) something like this : &amp;Help &amp;About &amp;Mozilla Firebird &amp;Plugins &amp;Config &amp;Blank Mo&amp;zilla (yes, the "Book of Mozilla" excerpt, why not ? :-) ) At least that's something that wouldn't be concealed. Of course that could be intentional in order to hide "about:config" to Mozilla Firebird newcomers. But a simple warning would suffice wouldn't it ? Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3. Actual Results: Only a small version of "about:" as "&amp;About Mozilla Firebird" under the "Help" section of the menu. Expected Results: List all the others "about:" as explained.</description>

      <title>search box displaying incorrectly, shorter, to the left, blank space on the right</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.6b) Gecko/20031213 Firebird/0.7+ Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.6b) Gecko/20031213 Firebird/0.7+ In previous versions of Firebird, I was able to modify userChrome.css to make the search box wider. Now, if I do this, the search box just appears moved to the right. The available space to type in is increased, but it doesn't draw correctly. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.Customize toolbar and move the search box to be next to the bookmarks. Quit Firebird. 2.Add the following to userChrome.css: /* Make the Search box flex wider */ #search-container { -moz-box-flex: 1.75 !important; } 3.Launch Firebird, and type a sentence which is longer than the search box. Actual Results: The search box appears to have been moved over to the left, and text spills out of the right side of the search box. Expected Results: The width of the search box should have been visibly expanded.</description>

Since Mozilla lacks the "Print" context menu option, I am unable to use Mozilla to print the page, and have to launch Microsoft Internet Explorer to accomplish the deed. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Visit http://www.nvidia.com/object/winxp_2k_53.03 2. Click the "Primary Download Site" link to download the driver. A "License For Customer Use of NVIDIA Software" window should now appear. 3. Right-click the "License For Customer Use of NVIDIA Software" windows and select the "Print" option. Oh wait ...um ...one does not exist. 4. Lanuch Microsoft Internet Explorer and attempt the same steps above. Notice that Internet Explorer makes this much easier. Actual Results: No "Print" option in context menu Expected Results: Would like a "Print" context menu option.</description>

I would like to see the actual URLs of the sites, as well as the page titles, as other browsers display history, like Mozilla and Netscape. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.Start Firebird 2.Go Menu &gt; History 3.Sort by Date 4.Expand any domain folder Actual Results: Only page titles of visited sites are shown. Expected Results: Shown at least page titles and URLs of sites, if not time and date visited. It can become quite confusing when there are 5 or 6 pages that only say "Mozilla Forum". Default Firebird 0.7 theme was used. At first I thought there was a problem with the file, but upon further investigation, I was told that this is the normal behaviour.</description>

      <title>Remember (in the profile) if tree view was last opened in the "Add Bookmark" Dialog</title>

Now that we have the Tree view available in the "Add Bookmark" dialog, there needs to be a way so that Firebird remembers whether the user last had the tree view visible or not. (This idea is based on how IE does it.) This is useful for people who really like the tree view, so that they can always have it visible -- like me. I also suggest that we store this option in the profile so that the repeated updates to the browser (that are often necessary) will not erase this preference.

Bug 228582 deals with the ability to remember if the user last had the tree view expanded or not. In this bug report, I suggest that we go a step folder and remember the last selected folder in the tree view (if the user is using the tree view) and have it highlighted and expanded next time the user returns to the bookmark dialog.

      <title>Tree View in "Add Bookmark" dialog is too small.</title>

This is a pretty small amount of space, for something as complex as a tree view. To truly use the tree view effectively, we need to show more lines. How many lines? I do not know. Internet Explorer shows 10. However, what factor we should use to determine how many lines to show as default, I am not sure. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

I would have liked to just using the "Add Bookmark" dialog. So, I suggest that we add the toolbars (the ones you can add bookmarks to) to the tree view in the "Add Bookmark" dialog. Each toolbar that the user has created would be on the same level (in the tree) as the "Bookmarks" For additional useability, you might consider using a different icon to represent the toolbars as opposed ot the bookmarks. Perhaps just change the color from yellow to something else? or draw something fancy? Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

      <title>Would like a way to freeze a window even when supportDDEExec is true</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.6b) Gecko/20031203 Firebird/0.7+ Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.6b) Gecko/20031203 Firebird/0.7+ I'm caught between two conflicting desires: There are some windows that I do not want to be hijacked when I click on links in other programs (because they are showing something important that I'm working on). At the same time, I'd rather not set supportDDEExec to false, and have a fresh window pop up each time and clutter up my desktop (and bloat Firebird). It would be really nice to have a "View" option to "freeze" a window (i.e. make it immune to being hijacked by DDEExec). When a DDE request comes in, FB should pick one of the windows that do *not* have this freeze flag set (but otherwise using whatever algorithm it uses now for which of those windows to pick). It should open a new window if there are no such windows. There's no need (that I can see) to make this persistent in any fashion (e.g. remember a per-site preference for this flag, or anything like that). A purely transient flag is enough. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Set user_pref("advanced.system.supportDDEExec", true); 2. Bring up an important page, among a bunch of other windows. 3. Click on a URL in an external app. Actual Results: 1. Watch the window with the important page being hijacked :-). Expected Results: 1. Some way to set a flag on that Window in the View menu, perhaps, to prevent this hijacking of just that one window.</description>

      <title>'Block animated images from site X' menu option</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.5) Gecko/20031007 Firebird/0.7 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.5) Gecko/20031007 Firebird/0.7 When right-clicking on an image you get the option to block all images from that server. But if it's an animated image it would be more useful to block only animated images from from that server. (They might have to be downloaded, but not shown to the user.) You could have two separate right-click menu items, block animated images and block all images, but I think it would make most sense to have only the 'block animated images' menu item appear when right-clicking on such an image. If after blocking animated images from a site you continue to be annoyed by still images from the same site, you could right-click on one of those to block them too. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: Visit a site with an animated GIF. Right-click on the image. Actual Results: Menu appears with option 'Block images from foo.com'. Expected Results: Menu item reads instead 'Block animated images from foo.com' and behaves accordingly. But right-clicking on a still image would show the 'Block images' menu item as before.</description>

There are certainly other workable implementations, such as a gc-able database. Observations and opinions: 1. The desirable behavior for favicons is *not* cache-like, so should not be implemented as such. In particular, if you've got 100 bookmarks with link/favicons (including sidebar and toolbar folder), you *REALLY* want them to be displayed all the time. 2. copying bookmarks.html should copy the icons. 3. it would be nice to define your own icons for pages which don't have 'em (including folders - 4. icons are no more part of the served content than page titles - the server provides a default title for the page which the client is free to use, change or ignore completely. IMHO, page titles should be the model that is used for page icons. 5. non-bookmarked pages may be considered a separate issue - in particular, I'd say that using the (proposed) bookmark-supplied icons should be a useful optimization, rather than a required behavior.

I will add a image to make this more clear. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. make sure you have a lot of folders 2. wait your mouse a folder so it opens in a submenu 3. move your mouse fast but diagonal into the submenu Actual Results: the submenu closes because the mouse has hit another selection Expected Results: there has to be some sort of delay so you can move your mouse diagonal</description>

      <title>Scrollbar customization</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.4) Gecko/20030624 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.4) Gecko/20030624 Copied from similar entry for Browser (Seamonkey). Firebird should support changing the color/style of the scrollbars (esp. for overflow: auto; divs and textareas), similar to IE and Konquerer using moz-specific CSS. Personally I see this area as an opportunity for Mozilla to, yet again, surpass IE in developer and end-user features. Let's face it, better browsers and more features largely benefit web developers first and foremost. I am able to create a similar web site on browsers from NS4 to IE6, but NS4 is a developer nightmare. Mozilla has no exceeded IE in supporting developers and is why I now use it as my primary browser and development platform. The issue of scrollbar 'skinning' is important to a web designer because it detracts from the ability we have from creating designs that are consistent throughout. As has been said previously it is not so important that the primary browser scrollbars be skinned but rather on those the exist within a page, whether that be a textarea or a div with overflow:auto; The arguement that it ruins a consistent user interface is irrelevent since we all know styles can be changed completely on nearly all form elements (minus some annoynaces with select elements). As well as the fact that Mozilla can be skinned (including scrollbars) and the default 'Modern' skin does not match that of any OS. I propose a much more detailed approach by treating scrollbars as elements within CSS as follows: -moz-scrollbar-track { width: border: background: } -moz-scrollbar-face { width: border: background: } -moz-scrollbar-arrow { width: height: border: background: } Those are what I would consider the primary attributes of the elements and allow for not only changing the colors of the elements but also the ability to use images as a background as well. ------- Additional Comment #79 From Dwight Brown 2003-12-15 09:02 ------- After my initial proposal I gave the concept more thought and think inherency would be needed and that this may be a more proper solution: -moz-scrollbar { -moz-scrollbar-width: -moz-scrollbar-border: -moz-scrollbar-background: -moz-scrollbar-face-border: -moz-scrollbar-face-background: -moz-scrollbar-track-border: -moz-scrollbar-track-background: -moz-scrollbar-arrow-border: -moz-scrollbar-arrow-color: -moz-scrollbar-arrow-background: } The -moz-scrollbar attributes would be inherited by the other optional specific attributes. -moz-scrollbar-arrow-color: would define the arrow color and if set to "transparent" would allow for developers to use the background attribute to create their own. For example: -moz-scrollbar { -moz-scrollbar-width: 0.15in; -moz-scrollbar-border: 1px solid black; -moz-scrollbar-background-color: white -moz-scrollbar-track-background-color: silver; -moz-scrollbar-arrow-background-color: silver; -moz-scrollbar-arrow-color: blue; } Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

There is not an option in the View menu to hide that status bar. There should be. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open the bookmark manager 2. Observe the status bar at the bottom of the window 3. Explore the View menu until you are satisfied that there is no way to hide it</description>

This is a very common feature in most of the recent softwares even in opensource projects like JEdit. Also the added benefit is that users may not face a lot of bugs that you have already fixed in the new release they are getting it only because they are using an old version. Reproducible: Didn't try Steps to Reproduce: Expected Results: Right now there is no such option and user has to re-download complete Firebird again and have to go through the installation again.</description>

      <title>New windows/tabs address is "about:blank" if not properly loaded</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.5) Gecko/20031007 Firebird/0.7 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.5) Gecko/20031007 Firebird/0.7 When I open links in new windows or tabs, the address remains "about:blank" if the page fails to load properly. This means that, when I open numerous links in new tabs, it's awkward to work out which links (eg. if I want to retry them). IEs approach of completing the address bar with the URL whether it works or not is much friendlier. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open a link that doesn't work in a new window or tab. Actual Results: The address bar became "about:blank". Expected Results: The address bar should've become the URL for the page.</description>

      <title>Bookmarks should have option to avoid cache</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.6b) Gecko/20031218 Firebird/0.7+ Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.6b) Gecko/20031218 Firebird/0.7+ Many web sites give news and are updated frequently, such as newspaper sites and sites such as MozillaZine. The user always wants to see the most recent version. The bookmarks should incorporate a field that could be marked that every time the user selects the bookmark, Mozilla gets a non-cached version, that is a version that is neither locally cached, nor proxy cached. This compares to a ctrl-shift-R or a ctrl-F5 every time the page (bookmark) is accessed. It could be achieved by adding an option to the Schedule tab of the bookmark to "Check for updates &lt;&lt;every time&gt;&gt;" for instance. However, it is not clear if and how the Schedule feature can be used to obtain this behaviour. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Bookmark MozillaZine web site. 2. Choose MozillaZine from bookmark. Actual Results: A locally cached or proxy cached version of the web page is shown. Expected Results: The non-cached version of the web page should be shown, as indicated by the user in a to-be-added option in the bookmark properties.</description>

It is a redundant UI element and should be eliminated to streamline the interface. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce:</description>

      <title>Use distinct file extensions for pre-processed content, so they can be validated during compile time</title>
      <description>Part of the discussion in Bug 229639 revolved around distinguishing content which is pre-processed (XBL, XUL, XHTML, JS, CSS) from "normal" content by using a distinct file extension such as .pre-xml, etc. This would help distinguish content which can be checked for well-formed-ness and potentially for validity from content which requires separate pre-processing before it should be checked. As part of this bug it should be possible to hook in validating checks to ensure that both the "normal" content and the output of the pre-processed content is valid.</description>

      <title>Remove "Create in" from Add Bookmark dialog</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.6b) Gecko/20031230 Firebird/0.7+ Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.6b) Gecko/20031230 Firebird/0.7+ Now that we have that handy expandable arrow in the Add Bookmark dialog which gives us a tree view of our bookmark folders, we have a redundancy problem. The "Create in" box gives us a space efficient method of choosing the folder, but a less intuitive interface. The "Arrow" gives us a nice visual representation of our folders, but it makes the "Add Bookmark" window much larger. Also to consider; as it stands now, the presence of the “Create in” box hinders the effectiveness of the “Arrow’s” easy interface. Let us assume that you are adding a new bookmark into a different folder. For the “Create in” method you must click the drop-down and click the folder (2 clicks.) For the “Arrow,” you must click The Arrow and click the folder (2 clicks also.) The only difference is The Arrow offers a more visually comprehensive interface. Now let us assume that the window is changed to remove the “Create in” and make the tree view front and center, sans Arrow. This time you need only click the folder (1 click.) You have also opted for the ease-of-use interface (2 benefits.) The 1 drawback is the dialog size. The “Add Bookmark” window becomes much larger when you replace a slim drop-down box with a full blown tree view. This should not become a problem, however, because of the following reason. When you are adding a bookmark: 1. You are not taking more than a few seconds 2. You are not working in/looking at the browser during those few seconds There is, therefore, no reason to be conservative with screen space. I suppose one could suggest that a tree view could be a visually complex interface for your average user, but I could then suggest that the tree view is one that is a common element of both Windows and Mac OS interfaces. It is also one that is obvious and self-explanatory (unlike the “Create in” box.) So to conclude, I can’t believe you read all the way to the end. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Bookmarks &gt; Add to Boomarks or Ctrl D 2. Check out that weird drop-down box 3. Check out that cool tree view (by clicking The Arrow) 4. Notice the problem?</description>

Another useful function would be to open the tab bar into a toolbox when moving it. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. n/a 2. 3. Expected Results: Ability to move and dock tab bar at the bottom of the screen, to assist in net navigation in combination with new windows (eg. being next to the windows taskbar). A further enhancement would be the ability to drag the tab bar into a tool box state, allowing the user more screen space and, if the window is not in a full screen mode, access to all the tabs.</description>

Expected Results: A preference box with a greater degree of options (such as file types and other cosmetics from about:config etc.) that rivals I.E's preferences. (if you like, a bit like tweak UI) An options, or advanced, dialog which lets the user change options such as the way download manager/tabs etc. work. Ideally the advanced dialog is a one stop set-up that can be reviewed by the user periodically. The seperation prevents user errors that will negativly affect their experience using Firebird (if they change options by mistake) and ease clearing up of the crowded options box. It also adds to the feel that the browser is an integrated component, making IE more redundant to the end user (in order to expand firebird's acceptance as an alternative)</description>

The page is &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd"&gt; and has been validated (http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jpsdomain.org%2Fabout.html). The CSS has also been validated, which is how I found what I think is the root cause (bad MIME type). When run from a different ISP (and locally) the same HTML and CSS code works in Firebird and all other tested browsers. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Browse to http://www.jpsdomain.org/about.html = CSS broken 2. Browse to http://www.speakeasy.org/~vossenjp/about.html = CSS works 3. This shows valid CSS: http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.speakeasy.org%2F%7Evossenjp%2Fjpsdomain.css&amp;warning=1&amp;profile=css2&amp;usermedium=all 4.

Expected Results: Ideally, Firebird should honor this, even though it's technically broken. I'd like to ask my ISP to fix this, but I'll wait a while in case the broken configuration is useful for testing (let me know). I don't have high hopes for a successful fix anyway from them anyway... :-(</description>

      <title>Add support for HTML5 History.pushState(), History.replaceState() methods</title>
      <description>This enhancement introduces the following new methods from HTML5 to the History interface: * History.pushState(data, title, [url]) adds a new history entry associated with the given data, changes the window title, and optionally changes the page URL. * History.clearState() clears all history associated with the current Document. Additionally, the enhancement adds the onpopstate event to Window. See the following links for details: * pushState: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/?slow-browser#dom-history-pushstate * clearState: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/?slow-browser#dom-history-clearstate * popstate: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/?slow-browser#activating-state-object-entries</description>

Currently, the user must enter their password every time they start a new session. The main reason I use the 'Master Password' feature is so in the event my laptop gets stolen, my passwords are not accessible. If I could limit this to bothering me to enter my password once every 7 days or so, I would be a much happier camper. Reproducible: Always I'd also like to see this feature in Thunderbird.</description>

      <title>"browser.urlbar.matchBehavior" set to "3" doesn't filter out "www." from a URL. Only http://</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1) Gecko/20090624 Firefox Firefox/3.5 () Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1) Gecko/20090624 Firefox Firefox/3.5 () When "browser.urlbar.matchBehavior" is set to a value of 3, it searches for matches at the beginning of URL's, titles, etc. The problem is that it doesn't start the word matching after the "www." part of URL's, while it does start after "http://". This seems like it would be a very simple fix, as all it would require is adding a second term to whatever filter handles the "http://" part. Yet this bug has been in Firefox for AGES! Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. browser.urlbar.matchBehavior = 3 (matching only the beginning) 2. browser.urlbar.default.behavior = 16 (matching only URLs) 3. Now type in a new URL that starts with "www." and hit enter. 4. Now click on the address bar again and start typing whatever was after the "www." part of your url. Actual Results: You'll find it doesn't show results for it. You have to start with www. to get the result. Expected Results: It should start matching words after the "www." part, to show results accurately. This bug is the last thing holding my "Old Location Bar" extension ( https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/7637/ ) back from it's ultimate goal. And this problem has been talked about all over the internet ages now.</description>

This is counter-intuitive. There is already ctrl-Q (quit) command for quitting the application. I know there is about:config option to disable this, but please provide a more friendly GUI option to turn that off, and have it off by default. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Press ctrl-W when one single tab remains 2. 3. Actual Results: Firefox quits. Expected Results: Firefox remains with empty tab. I tend to close multiple tabs and always end up over-reaching and quitting instead of a blank slate to start over. This is a human factor issue, whereby the software should be simple to use for humans, not vice versa. The software shouldn't assume we are turning it fully off. I wouldn't want a car that shuts its engine off everytime I brake for full stop for more than 10 seconds. Severity major since it's a major human factor issue.</description>

Press CONTROL-L (lowercase L or uppercase, does not matter) Actual Results: The JavaScript overrides the default behaviour of CONTROL-L. Expected Results: Focus should change to the address location bar in Firefox (the default behaviour). Would be nice to prohibit websites from taking over specific keys. Firefox should have intercepted the CONTROL-L, prompting me to permit or deny the ability for the site to override those keystrokes.</description>

When you tear a tab it doesnt leave the tab inside its window it either moves the entire window itself or tears the tab from its window. Basiclly a similar behivor can be achived in firefox by just hiding the tab you tear and if its the only tab in the window, hiding that window to. Reproducible: Always</description>

For those that are not familiar with what I am talking about, on both of the aforementioned browsers, if you right click on the address bar one of the options that appears in the menu alongside "Cut", "Copy", and "Paste" is the "Paste and Go" option. This is a small time saver that belongs in Firefox. Reproducible: Always</description>

So i can write tag+ and all bookmarks of this tag will be opening in new tabs. Further i was thinking, what to do with more than one tag. perhaps you can handle it in this way: - you type "tag1+ tag2+": this will open all bookmarks of the tags tag1 and tag2. - you type "tag1 tag2+": this will open only the intersection of both tags.

Here is the real life use case that made me think of this: My wife and I use bookmark synching on Firefox. She uses the bookmark toolbar at home to store bookmarks about shopping and furniture, etc.. I use the bookmark toolbar at work for Live bookmarks for the work wiki, bugs, etc. We both use different bookmark profiles, but when she adds a bookmark at home (say about a new couch), it appears on the toolbar at work. The reason is because bookmark toolbar items are stored in the same folder, so even XMarks (or Weave) will not be able to tell whether it should sync a toolbar bookmark across all computers on all profiles or not. Now, if you could specify which folder could be used for the bookmark toolbar, it would eliminate the problem, because each profile would be storing and retrieving bookmarks from different folders. Thoughts? Do you think there is a better solution? Reproducible: Always</description>

The problem is that some domains are spread in different countries, so for example if I want to block all google domains I have to add infinite domains to the cookie exceptions list. Would be possible to add the wild-card or regular expression support to the domains? So it would be possible to write something like this: - google.* block (wild-card solution) - google\.\w+ block (regex solution) Reproducible: Always</description>

      <title>display client certificate selected</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-GB; rv:1.9.1) Gecko/20090616 Firefox/3.5 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-GB; rv:1.9.1) Gecko/20090616 Firefox/3.5 The Navigation bar currently shows the server certificate used to connect to the web site being viewed. It would be very helpful to also show the client certificate being used and enable the client to break the ssl connection by pressing that button. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Get a client certificate You can create a client certificate easily using the http://test.foafssl.org/cert/ service 2. Connect to one of the servers that require a client certificate. For a list of such services see http://esw.w3.org/topic/foaf+ssl . But here is one that should be reliable available: https://foafssl.org/srv/idp . (Note some of the services uses the initial client certificate connection to create a cookie, which is then used for identification. This enhancement request would not apply to such services) 3. You will be asked to choose a client certificate if you have more than one Choose one. 4. If the certificate is accepted, you will be connected. At this point Firefox only displays the server certificate next to the URL bar. This is very nice and easy to understand. But it would be very good to display the name of the Subject certificate next to that in a human friendly way (just display the Name part of the DN). Expected Results: Firefox should show a user friendly name of the Client Certificate used in a button next to the one showing the server certificate. Clicking on that button should allow the user to select a different client certificate (essentially allowing him to logout and use a different persona), or even just logout. By making it clear to the user what client certificate he is using, the browser can then by default use the same certificate on the next visit to the site. This should remove the need to select certificates when reaching a site that requests makes a request, in such a way as to also make it transparent what certificate is being used in the connection.</description>

Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Create a number of client certificates You can easily create these using a service such as http://test.foafssl.org/cert/ 2. Go to a service that requests a client certificates. A number of such services are listed on http://esw.w3.org/topic/foaf+ssl One such is https://foafssl.org/srv/idp should be available. Another one is the login button on http://foaf.me 3. The browser asks the user to select a client certificate. It shows much too much information, that is only understandable by software engineers. Expected Results: The browser should ask the user to select the client certificate in a very minimal way, showing information that is much more relevant to the user: this is really only information pertaining to the name part of the DN. Safari does a good job presenting the right information. See the pictures of the iPhone http://blogs.sun.com/bblfish/entry/one_click_global_sign_on (Note the iPhone has a number of SSL bugs as listed here: http://lists.foaf-project.org/pipermail/foaf-protocols/2009-June/000677.html ) Opera does it well too.

While I agree with the rationale and decision reached, no replacement gesture with key modifier was offered in place. Adding the following restores such a feature, permitting tab change with a left or right three finger swipe with the shift key modifier: browser.gesture.swipe.left.shift added and set to Browser:PrevTab and browser.gesture.swipe.right.shift added and set to Browser:NextTab As the shift key is already used as the modifier with the pinch-in and pinch-out gestures to reset the zoom level of the page, it would make sense to use the same with left and right swipes. As it is just a default configuration change that has little to no risk of regression, might this be considered for the current stable release?

      <title>Firefox should offer to view .ZIP archives using its jar: protocol handler</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9.2a1pre) Gecko/20090704 Minefield/3.6a1pre Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9.2a1pre) Gecko/20090704 Minefield/3.6a1pre Firefox can display the contents of .ZIP files using its built-in jar: protocol handler. But Firefox will not offer to view the contents of .ZIP files or even .jar files. You have to know to change a URL like http://www.skierpage.com/moz_bugs/simple.myarchive to jar:http://www.skierpage.com/moz_bugs/simple.myarchive!/ Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Browse to remote .ZIP and .jar files. http://www.skierpage.com/moz_bugs/ has simple.zip (served as application/zip) and simple.myarchive (served as application/java-archive), which you can view and/or save locally. 2. Browse to local .ZIP and .jar files. Actual Results: Firefox won't offer to let you view the contents, even if the remote file is served with the "application/java-archive" mime type. Expected Results: When you click on a ZIP archive, Firefox should offer to "View archive contents in Firefox" and use its existing jar: protocol handler and jar:&lt;URL&gt;!/ trick to show you the contents. To view the contents of remote files served as application/zip using the jar:&lt;URL&gt;!/ trick, you have to change network.jar.open-unsafe-types to true in about:config. I don't know if this should apply if you explicitly choose the new "View archive contents in Firefox" option that I am proposing. When you save locally, you can always use the jar: trick regardless of extension without needing to change about:config; e.g. if you save a ZIP file as simple.blah in /tmp, then jar:file:///tmp/simple.blah!/ works. However, a general "View this file in Firefox as if it were [text/XML/ZIP archive/HTML/OGG]" capability seems like a separate bug.</description>

      <title>geolocation: Access to a GPS receiver on UNIXoid platforms</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.0.3) Gecko/2008092816 Iceweasel/3.0.7 (Debian-3.0.7-1) Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.2a1pre) Gecko/20090706 Minefield/3.6a1pre Right now, the navigator.geolocation.* JS-accessible functions (at least on my Linux box) seem to simply use the javascript implementation of geocoding (which is implemented in NetworkGeolocationProvider.js). Except maybe in dense metropoles, this method imposes a high uncertainity of user's current location. (If I use that here at my dayjob's location, it's about 4km distance between what it guessed and where I am. And this is only because I work for a larger company located at a quite small village. In other areas, the error is probably much higher.) Being one who plays with the geolocation stuff (eg. at http://webcontent.osm.lab.rfc822.org/), I want to get useable coordinates. As I don't see a common way for various platforms and architectures to access a GPS receiver (let alone the correct one if there are two or more), I implemented another backend (additional to the Wifi/IP one, the Maemo one and the WindowsMobile implementation) that calls an external script via popen() and getting the required information from there. The atteched patch is for RFC only, as there are a number of rough edges: * There's of course no single script that'll work for everybody. * It won't be called at all, because the backend detection logic at dom/src/geolocation/nsGeolocation.cpp, method nsGeolocationService::nsGeolocationService, isn't really effective here, because the JS implementation (NetworkGeolocationProvider.js) is already registered beforehand. Thus, the user either has to delete that file, or we'll need to write another patch to allow a user to choose the backend implementation. * The Makefile fragment is likely suboptimal. There should be a check for the target platform being POSIX.1 compliant (eg. having popen()). But I don't know the whole codebase good enough to get that right. * My implementation is based on the WindowsMobile stuff. That was choosen because it already implements polled access to the GPS receiver. I tried to rip off unneeded stuff, but being primarily a C coder (and not C++), I probably missed an opportunity here and there... * This needs some more documentation. Especially the format that the popen()ed program is expected to conform to. Finally, it works for me and I think that it's a good start for some knowledgeable Firefox hacker to finish it. Here's an example for a script (crude hack) to provide location information: ------------------------------------------------------------------- #!/usr/bin/env sh RESULT="`echo "o" | timeout 0.2 nc localhost gpsd 2&gt; /dev/null | grep -v Killed`" LATITUDE="`echo "${RESULT}" | cut -f 4 -d ' '`" LONGITUDE="`echo "${RESULT}" | cut -f 5 -d ' '`" ALTITUDE="`echo "${RESULT}" | cut -f 6 -d ' '`" HDOP="`echo "${RESULT}" | cut -f 7 -d ' '`" VDOP="`echo "${RESULT}" | cut -f 8 -d ' '`" HEADING="`echo "${RESULT}" | cut -f 9 -d ' '`" SPEED="`echo "${RESULT}" | cut -f 10 -d ' '`" if [ -n "${LATITUDE}" -a "${LATITUDE}" != '?' -a -n "${LONGITUDE}" -a "${LONGITUDE}" != '?' ]; then VALIDITY="valid" else VALIDITY="invalid" fi echo "${VALIDITY}" echo "${LATITUDE}" echo "${LONGITUDE}" echo "${ALTITUDE}" echo "${HDOP}" echo "${VDOP}" echo "${HEADING}" echo "${SPEED}" ------------------------------------------------------------------- Some feedback or guidance for further hacking (eg. a chooser for the backend to provide the geolocation information) would be nice. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: Open some website that's using the navigator.geolocation stuff and realize that you're miles away from where it things you are. http://webcontent.osm.lab.rfc822.org/ might be a start, choose the "Current location" link on the left. Actual Results: ...your geolocation being off for miles or kilometers. Expected Results: Place me to the correct (module some meters) position instead of somewhere in the next larger city :)</description>

      <title>HTML5 Video implementation improvements (codec and video output)</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1) Gecko/20090624 Firefox/3.5 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1) Gecko/20090624 Firefox/3.5 Currently, Firefox only implements OGG Vorbis as the primary codec for the HTML5 &lt;video tag. However, Youtube only wants to encode the video into H.264. Safari and Chrome already (or will) implement H.264 codecs. That leaves 3 choices: 1) Don't implement H.264, wait until Youtube encodes the videos to OGG format. 2) Implement H.264 silently, but don't push it. (As in don't release a Firefox with H.264 support.) Wait for Youtube to encode videos to OGG. (If not, implement.) 3) Implement H.264 immediately. Don't wait for Youtube to change. I would prefer option 2, since it lets Firefox keep up, but not let the open video part down. ** So where do we get the codec from? FFMPEG. FFMPEG is a project widely known, and is used in many applications for video decoding (and encoding). There is one problem though - H.264 is patented (one reason I would wait and see for Youtube). FFMPEG describes the legal issues here: http://www.ffmpeg.org/legal.html Strangely enough, Google Chrome will use FFMPEG in their browser for video decoding. I would wait and see, since Google/Youtube may adapt Theora as a format. Apple's Safari implements their own Quicktime library, which they purchased the software rights to use the MPEG and H.264 libraries. You can talk to the FFMPEG developers about their library and the legal issues that surround it, and they might help you. That's all for codecs. ====== VIDEO OUTPUT/SOUND OUTPUT The current method of displaying video is not efficient. For some computers, it may work, but others will have choppy video. The solution is accelerated video output. Accelerated video output is where the video is sent to the video card directly, instead of going through the normal display method. For Linux, there are quite a few. Here are the commonly used ones: - XVideo (default) - GL (OpenGL 1) - GL2 (OpenGL 2) - X11 (standard, nearly no acceleration) For Windows: - DirectX (obviously) - DirectX 3D - OpenGL - GDI - Video Card Memory For Mac OS X: - CoreVideo - Quartz These options SHOULD be placed in the Options dialog, in the Advanced section. Since each computer has a different video configuration, the option should be changeable. So who will implement it? You can ask MPlayer and VLC for help. If you're lucky, they may code the video output stuff for you. They probably (at least) will help you develop the video outputs. ** For the video codecs, I would prefer Theora. There's no patenting issues with it. Theora, by all means, is not as good as H.264. However, if the Theora codec developers get serious and improve the codec to the point it meets or exceeds H.264's quality and features, there will be no reason to not include it in the HTML5 specification. If Theora can be improved a lot, and (maybe) redesigned, it will happen. XVid is also an option.... but is based from MPEG4 specs, and is subject to patents.

Open http://www.sbb.ch 2. Enter "Zürich" in the "Von" field, "Bern" in the "Nach" field and click "Verbindung suchen" (or hit the Enter key) 3. Under the list of connections click "Druckansicht" (which is print version) 4. Cancel the printing dialog, as you might want to use print preview (in order to save paper, or because you remember having made your last print in landscape format with 200% scaling, or whatever) Actual Results: There is no possibility to use print preview from this window. Expected Results: Find "Print preview" in the context menu. Of course the problem occurs due to bad authoring here. (I had some correspondence about this with SBB, the major swiss railway company; they refused to add menu and tool bars to the window as their web agency did not like them.) Anyway this kind of bad authoring is quite widespread in the real world. Also, you still find lots of framed pages. Having the "Print this frame" option in the context menu is good; but additionnally having a print preview would be better.</description>

Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. set any filtering via browser.urlbar.default.behavior (e.g. 32) 2. go to URL bar, type ^ followed with any site from history Actual Results: Only matching addresses from history AND previously typed in (with 32 default.behavior as in this case) are shown.

      <title>Implement Workspaces</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.9.1.1) Gecko/20090715 Firefox/3.5.1 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729) Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.9.1.1) Gecko/20090715 Firefox/3.5.1 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729) The basic idea of tab grouping has been invented and re-invented a hundred times. Examples include: * Tabgroups-Plus (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/9187) * TabGroups Manager (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/10254) * Tab Groups (http://paranoid-androids.com/tabgroups/index.htm) * ... and various other theoretical ideas during the recent Mozilla Labs Design Challenge (http://design-challenge.mozilla.com/summer09/index.html) Due to the complexity of the feature, existing extensions lack stability and completeness. Since many users could benefit from such functionality, I thought that it may be best to build this into Firefox itself (hence the RFE). The idea is to keep it as simple and out-of-the-way as possible. The term "workspaces" is used by the OmniWeb browser (http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omniweb/), and its use would allow the "group" term to be reserved for use in grouping tabs by domain, origin, etc. within a workspace. The following is a list of some of the behaviour and UI features that could/should be supported. (See the attached mockups first.) - The Workspaces Bar should be hidden by default to avoid UI clutter and user confusion (can be shown using the "Show Workspaces Bar" option in the Workspaces Menu, by using the View -&gt; Toolbars menu, or by using a keyboard shortcut). - The Workspaces Bar is used for the management of workspaces, but may often be closed to increase the user's screen real estate. The Workspaces Menu would then be used due to its compactness. - Workspaces can be re-ordered in the Workspaces Bar using drag &amp; drop (the same way tabs are re-ordered). - Tabs (as well as links) can be dragged &amp; dropped onto existing workspace buttons. - Workspaces should be persisted across sessions (session restore, etc.). - It should be possible to prioritize the loading of the current workspace when restoring a session/starting Firefox. Other workspaces could load slowly in the background and get priority when selected (or not load until the workspace is opened [pref.]). Individual tabs should be loaded using strategies similar to the ones described in bug #496458. - Right clicking a workspace button should show a menu with the following options: New Workspace, Reload All Tabs in Workspace, Bookmark All Tabs in Workspace, Rename Workspace, Save Workspace, Close Workspace. - "Move To -&gt; {list of workspaces} + New Workspace" should be added to the right-click menu of tabs. - "Open Link in Workspace -&gt; {list of workspaces} + New Workspace" should be added to the right-click menu of links. - Preference should dictate in which workspace to load external links (currently selected or default workspace). - "List all tabs" drop down menu on the right of the tab bar should show all tabs in the currently selected workspace. (Tooltip could be changed to "List all tabs in workspace") - Preference should dictate if a tab overview page or the currently selected tab in a workspace should be displayed when a workspace is opened. - Prefs to show number of tabs in workspace next to the workspace name (one pref. for bar, one for menu). Number of tabs will show in the tooltip regardless. - Pref. to keep workspace open when it contains no tabs. While this may be similar to bug #453984, I feel that this has a larger scope and includes a lot more detail. The details above are somewhat unstructured, however if this bug receives attention, I will organise things on request. Reproducible: Always</description>

      <title>With the middle click, open the tab on mouse button down</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.11) Gecko/2009060215 Firefox/3.0.11 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.11) Gecko/2009060215 Firefox/3.0.11 I suggest to make background tab open on middle mouse button down, instead of mouse up. This is Opera's behavior, and it makes browser feel faster. This would eliminate user's ability to move the mouse away from link holding the button (if he pressed it accidentally), but notice that accidental opening of background tab isn't really dangerous - it doesn't interrupt reading, just this extra tab will need to be closed later with another middle click on it. It can be also made an option, to allow using old behaviour. Reproducible: Always</description>

Example: Youre browsing the Site www.example.com and Start to read the subsite www.example.com/longtext/01 till subsite www.example.com/longtext/91 there you set a temporary bookmark,and if you read up to www.example.com/longtext/99 the bookmark automatically should be set there and the old one should be removed. if this feature get implemented the 'restore session' feature could be controlled that way.

I liked this behaviour, but it seems to be impossible to get with FF 3.5. The option only allows new windows always, or new tabs always. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.Click on a URL in mail reader 2. 3. Actual Results: With Preferences-&gt;Tabs-&gt;"Open new wondows in a new tab" is set, I get a new tab, but the main FF window is often on a different virtual desktop from the mail reader, forcing me to switch desktops to see it. Alternatively, with the option turned off, every URL click gets a new window, which is clumsy. Expected Results: Open the URL in a new window on the same desktop, but if I click on a URL inside a FF window, open it as a new tab. This is what previous versions of FF did and it seemed to me correct.</description>

If you triple click a URL, firefox highlights the entire link AND the text around it. Shouldn't there be an easy way to highlight a link without having to position the mouse and drag? For example, change the triple-click functionality when the cursor is over a URL to highlight the entire URL instead of the entire paragraph? Thank you, Greg Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.Search for something on google.com 2.Try double- and triple-clicking on the green URLs of the results 3.Then click an drag over the entire URL - this is the only current way to grab the entire link Actual Results: Double-clicking will result in only part of the URL selected while triple clicking will result in more than the URL selected. Expected Results: Highlighting just the URL, nothing more or less. Performed on Ubuntu 9.04, but I know the functionality is the same on other operating systems.</description>

      <title>Enhance Crash Recovery to better help the user</title>
      <description>When our users crash they are pretty much in the dark about what caused the problem. They don't know about about:crashes or crash-stats.mozilla.com and probably for the most part don't care. But they do care that they are crashing. Some of them seem to be caught in an endless cycle of crashes without any idea of why. I think we can use the restore session page after a crash to better help our users by: 1. providing some indication of what caused the problem. If we can get to the data that is submitted to Socorro and analyze the top frame of the stack, we might be able to tell them that a specific plugin or addon is responsible for the crash and which page most likely caused the crash. 2. providing an easy way to disable the plugin or addon from the session restore page. Perhaps this is something that could be included in a UI sprint for 3.5.</description>

      <title>Create shortcuts by dragging Site Identity Button (currently only favicon does so)</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.1) Gecko/20090715 Firefox/3.5.1 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729) Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.1) Gecko/20090715 Firefox/3.5.1 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729) For non-SSL-encrypted pages, dragging the favicon from the identity box from the location bar to an explorer instance creates a shortcut. For SSL-encrypted pages, this feature is broken. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Drag the favicon from the identity box to the desktop or any other explorer instance. 2. See if any shortcut gets created (it won't, you can't even drag the favicon). Actual Results: One can't drag the favicon if one is visiting a SSL-encrypted page. Expected Results: It should have let me drag the favicon to create a shortcut.</description>

      <title>Identity hint window blocks bookmark toolbar when dragging favicon</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.1.1) Gecko/20090715 Firefox/3.5.1 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.1.1) Gecko/20090715 Firefox/3.5.1 The most convenient way for me to create shortcuts on the bookmark toolbar is to drag&amp;drop the web site favicon to the left of the address bar. Starting from Firefox 3.5.1, when I start dragging the icon, there is a hint window popping saying "This website does not supply identity information". The location of the window overlaps exactly on the bookmark toolbar and prevent me from dropping the icon to my bookmark folders. See the URL for a screenshot. Because almost all sites have "identity information", so this pops up almost for all cases when I was trying to create a bookmark. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. go to slashdot.com 2. start dragging the favicon and try to drop it on your bookmark bar Actual Results: try a few times and you will see this yellow "This website does not supply identity information" window blocking your way Expected Results: it would be more intuitive to popup the hint at another location and time</description>

Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: n/a Actual Results: n/a Expected Results: n/a Chrome has implemented something similar: on a per-tab basis it's possible to see which tab is using a lot of memory.</description>

      <title>Implement context menu for location bar yellow star (bookmark this page/edit bookmark, show bookmark in Library, remove bookmark) [make all bookmarks properties accessible]</title>
      <description>For the yellow star in location bar, implement a context menu that provides intuitive and fast access to (additional) functions involving the bookmark. Have a look and try it out yourself in the mock-up context menu which I have attached to this comment. For an existing bookmark, the context meny of the yellow star should at least have the following options: - Edit this bookmark (default) - Organize Bookmarks (will open the bookmark in the Library) - Remove this bookmark Having "Organize Bookmarks" on the context menu (which will select the bookmark in the library) might be a low-cost workaround fix for the justified complaint of bug 405795 where users are frustrated that they can't access all properties of a bookmark from the yellow star (in fact, there's NO place in FF where you can edit ALL properties of a bookmark directly, but that's another story). For a URL which hasn't been bookmarked yet, the grey star's context menu should at least have the following commands - Bookmark this page The current context menu of the star shows toolbar customization options, which doesn't feel right on such an outstanding object like the bookmarking star. Comments on the proposed UI are welcome.</description>

      <title>[Session Restore] Write sessionstore.js less often when on battery</title>
      <description>When we get the power notification service, it would be great to write sessionstore.js less often. In bug 506132 we reduced the frequency dramatically, but like Vlad said there, it'd be ideal to have finer control for battery vs plugged-in.</description>

      <title>Number of autocomplete dropdown menu entries should be customizable with about:config</title>
      <description>Right now there are always 6 entries shown in the autocomplete dropdown menu (hardcoded): http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/6beb76d1c2d8/browser/base/content/browser.xul#l386 IMO, this should be customizable with a preference in about:config. Let's say "browser.urlbar.autocomplete.entries". We can use 6 as standard, but it shouldn't really not be hardcoded since there are screens with a high resolution and enough space to display 8 or more rows.</description>

      <title>Silly UI idea: Help &gt; Report what sucks... (inviting feedback)</title>
      <description>(Prompted by http://eaves.ca/2009/07/28/remixing-angie-byron-to-create-the-next-million-mozillians/) Now that hundreds of millions of people are using Firefox, the average tech knowledge of a Firefox user has gone down significantly. This means, among other things, that people will not know what to do with any frustration they might have about their usage of Firefox. Let's add a menu item to the Help menu that invites feedback. I've tentatively called it "Report what sucks...". It would be similar to "Report Broken Websites..." in that it goes to some online form from Mozilla. Goals: - Provide an outlet for user frustration - If possible, provide a (more-or-less) human response to user problems - Get hints on what could be improved - Give feedback on what Mozilla is working on already - Draw people in to become contributors Thoughts: - Optional contact details - Separate fields "what sucks" and "any idea how to solve it" - Be a first line of defense for Bugzilla - Text to discourage Bugzilla-knowledgeable people from using it</description>

      <title>Need more reporting/info in cross-domain request scenarios</title>

This makes it really hard to debug... Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Issue an XHR cross-domain to a server that isn't Access-Control aware or in such a way as to not comply with its Access-Control policies. 2. Check the error console. Actual Results: No warnings/messages. Expected Results: Some kind of warning message at least indicating that the XHR /was/ blocked for access-control reasons; even better would be something that indicates exactly /why/ it was blocked (i.e. that indicates which step of the checking algorithm it failed at).</description>

Here's what I suggest: 1. Away with the Title bar, move min/max/close buttons to navbar's far right side 2. The page title goes into address bar, and replaces the URL there 3. The URL is visible on hovering on the address bar, where it can also be selected/changed as normal. Any comments? Reproducible: Always</description>

      <title>I should be able to prevent selection disabling</title>

The script is as follows: &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt; /*************************************************************************************************************** *Copyprotection for this site is provided by WP-CopyProtect v1.9 visit www.TheChetan.com/wp-copyprotect/ for more details *Selection Disabled, Please DO NOT COPY. **************************************************************************************************************/ function disableSelection(target){ if (typeof target.onselectstart!="undefined") //For IE target.onselectstart=function(){return false} else if (typeof target.style.MozUserSelect!="undefined") //For Firefox target.style.MozUserSelect="none" else //All other route (For Opera) target.onmousedown=function(){return false} target.style.cursor = "default" } &lt;/script&gt; This causes Firefox to prevent me from selecting any of the content. This is undesirable it interferes with the fair use of the content, e.g. quoting short excerpts in order to comment on it. As with other "copy protection" techniques, such as right-click blocking, it does not actually prevent copying anyway, as I can view the source of the website and copy that (or just disable JavaScript for the duration), or just copy the text manually. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Load the website 2. Move the mouse over any part of the page and observe the cursor, which will remain a pointer, not a text selection cursor 3. Attempt to select any text; nothing will happen. Actual Results: See "steps to reproduce" There should be an option in the JavaScript advanced preferences to disable this behaviour, as with right-click blocking and window resizing.</description>

      <title>Entering text into the address bar which is misinterpreted as a URL should run a Google search instead of showing the "Address Not Found" page</title>

In that case, getting the "Address Not Found" page is completely unhelpful, and a search makes a lot more sense. Yes, I know I can use the search bar for that, but the current behaviour breaks expectations in that most natural language text does not look like a URL or component of a URL and hence will not be falsely interpreted as one. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Type something like "/etc/hosts information" or "java.lang.String" into address bar and hit enter Actual Results: The "Address Not Found" page is shown Expected Results: A Google "I am feeling lucky" search is run with the term(s) provided</description>

      <title>Three or four sizes of toolbar icons</title>

Additionally, we are seeing 10 - 12 inch screen sizes in netbooks, with increasing pixel counts. Also - more and more, laptops are becoming most of the computer market. Firefox icons are raster images, so they look smaller as screen resolutions increase. In fact, the 24-pixel "large" icons can be inscrutable for some users. I would like to request that Firefox enable additional icon sizes. IIRC, the capacity was built in a few years ago. Having this capacity would allow the default and third-party themes to provide small, medium and large icons to allow for greater flexibility in user experience. At the least, three sizes. Reproducible: Always As an example of a theme that use 24-pixel icons for "small" and 32-pixel icons for "large," see the Aeon theme. To see a theme that uses 32-pixel and 48-pixel icons for "small" and "large," see Aeon Big. Of course, there is also Aeon Jumbo, with its 48px and 64px icons. I would recommend the following labels for icon sizes: 16px - x-small 24px - small 32px - medium 48px - large 64px - x-large Even if the default theme does not make use of the additional icon sizes, third-party themers could do so. Of course, svg icons would obviate the need for this, but I believe what I propose could be done now, where any svg icon capacity would lie sometime in the indefinite future.</description>

Why can't it be done, that Firefox asks only once at the start of the session? Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. set proxy with password and set master password 2. close firefox with multiple page open and let firefox save the pages to open next time firefox runs. 3. start firefox. Actual Results: I have to type the master password for EACH saved pages. If I saved 5 pages, I have to type it 5 TIMES. Or if FF is updated, I have to type master password as many times as the number of plugins I have installed. Expected Results: FF should ask master password only once, then allowing the typing of proxy password or pressing enter for saved one, and FF will open everythng perfectly after it. Even upgrading shouldn't ask for more than one master password when checking for plugin compatibility or for multiple plugin update.</description>

      <description>Bug 485976 moves file writing off the main thread, but we're still writing the whole file every time. This could be to update the scroll position. Bug 506482 notes how it's pretty excessive to write the whole file. I've heard this outside of bug reports too. After a chat in the office yesterday, I've concluded that it'd (probably) be more efficient if instead of writing the whole file, we write out only the parts that change. I'd thought about this before, but was always put off by the complexity of the data we store. It wouldn't be efficient to break down all of the objects, but if we break down to a tab level &amp; just store the tab data as a string, this should be doable. I haven't thought about all the details but having 2 tables (tabs &amp; windows) with a simple relationship and a couple fields for id, order, closed, maybe a couple others. I imagine this could hurt Ts a bit since we'll have to build up a JSON object in nsSessionStartup. But the tradeoff might be worth it (especially on mobile devices where disk writes are expensive)</description>

Sometime ago, on updating from 3.0.3 to the newer version, WE HAVE BEEN ENCOUNTERING A HIGHLY IRRITATING POP UP WARNNING BOX EVERY TIME WE TRY TO LAUNCH FIREFOX. It reads: "Windows cannot find C:\Documents and Settings\rimu\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\k53b189s.defaults\extensions\{CF40ACC5-e1BB-4aff-AC72-04C2F616BCA7}\chrome\content\getPlus.Adobe_reg_bootstrap.exe'. Make sure you typed the name correctly and then try again. To search for a file,click the start button and then click Search." Being laypeople in the field of IT, the most we could try is search for the file which the message said, "cannot be found". We cant take this any more &amp; realise IT IS due to upgrading to the new version (having uninstalled 3.0.3 and not seeing it at all &amp; then upgrading to 3.5.2 and once again bearing the pain of seeing it reappear!!! I understand you have said "do not expect a response" at the top. But dear friends at Mozilla, if we are such devoted fans of yours &amp; have taken the trouble to ask valuable tech advice, could you PLEASE reply and tell us the way out of this? MANY MANY THANKS A.

      <title>Dragging a URL or bookmark onto a tag folder in the bookmark toolbar should add that tag to it</title>
      <description>I dragged a couple tags into my bookmark toolbar a while back... works conveniently, shows me a list of bookmarks with that tag on it. But the UI looks just like a bookmark folder, so it confused me when it didn't work the same (because I forgot it was a tag folder). I tried to drag a new URL into that folder, and it wouldn't let me. I was about to file a bug that dragging into bookmark folders on the toolbar was broken. But then I discovered that it *did* work on another folder in my toolbar. I think a good UI to avoid this confusion would be: 1) When dragging a bookmark from elsewhere to a tag folder a) add that tag to the bookmark b) if the "copy modifier key" (option on mac, probably control on Windows?) was not being held at the time, move the bookmark to Unsorted (out of its current location) to avoid the user thinking it didn't get moved (essentially making a copy will confuse them if that's not what they asked for by holding the key) 2) When dragging a URL from the URL bar into a tag folder a) create a bookmark in unsorted for it b) add that tag to it.</description>

      <title>Implement custom session save and restore (save URLs of all tabs and their history)</title>
      <description>Currently, FF can only save one session, for the last window with multiple tabs. I have often missed a feature to save and restore a running session including history for any open FF window. This is not a duplicate of Bug 416040 - Save all tabs for offline use (store whole session). That bug wants to save a complete offline file cache of the session as a file. This bug might be a dupe, but I couldn't find anything.</description>

      <title>Quick Find is functionless; replace it with the full Find bar</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1) Gecko/20090624 Firefox/3.5 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1) Gecko/20090624 Firefox/3.5 Many ages ago, when Firefox was named something else, you introduced the best Find utility ever integrated into a browser. It cast aside the silly and obstructive Find window that still persists in lesser browsers, and was one of the improvements that really cemented Firefox as a user-friendly but simple browser with sensible default behavior. The Find utility accessible by pressing Ctrl+F is basically unchanged today. Back when it debuted, pressing forward slash (/) was a quick and easy way of getting to what appeared to be the exact same Find feature. This appealed to Unix geeks, who were accustomed to the forward slash's use in searching through text interfaces like the vi editor. But at some point a few years ago, someone decided that a watered-down version called Quick Find should be available to users as well, and triggered by the forward slash. I'd like to question this decision. Find takes up the same amount of screen real estate at the bottom of the browser window as Quick Find; it also has four very simple controls (Next, Previous, Highlight all and Match case) that are not difficult to use and cannot possibly take up very much memory. In short, I'd like to suggest that Quick Find has no real function, no clear advantage over Find, and that it should be removed and replaced by Find ... or, if this is not feasible, that Quick Find should be given the same feature set as Find, as it was in the age of the revolution. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Press forward slash. 2. Watch the bottom edge of the browser window. 3. Quick Find will come up, and disappoint. Actual Results: The user launches Quick Find, which has no useful features. It can be replaced even during a find by pressing Ctrl+F, however this requires more keystrokes. Expected Results: Find should come up after the user presses forward slash. Failing that, Quick Find should revert to having a feature set identical to Find.</description>

It can be difficult to go through many (20+) Tabs to locate ALL the audio and video and terminate the playing of each to keep one (or none) playing. If the Tabs were tinted or flashed until selected (IF they had audio playing) we could locate them fast and stop the audio in the Window from playing.

Why: I use Windows, that Operating System and many programs work better if you set Internet Explorer as the "Default Browser" (even if you use Firefox as your "preferred Browser"). Firefox would need to be 100% identical to IE (Bugs and all) to resolve that issue. If you have the Acrobat Plug-in for Firefox (Namoroka) installed, open an URL to a .PDF file and click on a link in the PDF then Internet Explorer will open the URL (assuming it is your Default Browser). This mode of operation _differs_ from what one would expect had they clicked on a link in any other Tab (that you would go to that URL, (or if 'Javascripted' (etc.), that a New Window would open)). One might argue this is a Bug, that for Accessibility reasons we _must_ provide either: 1. Some means for (visually impaired) people to know that they are on a Tab that is a PDF file and thus any links clicked on will open in a different program (unexpected ?). 2. Force links in PDFs to simply open in a new Tab (or the same Tab) in the same manner as if a link were clicked on any other Tab - do not make the HMI different for the PDF Plug-in.

This allows users to surf under the highest possible security settings, but still quickly change settings to view specific sites. As a harder to do alternative, detect when a web page may not be displaying properly due to security settings, and then automatically present a slider to change security settings or cancel. Reproducible: Always I think this would be useful for novice internet users (who don't want to muck about in preference pages). May also be popular among internet users who've heard of 'that security thing' and are concerned, but don't know/want to know how to actually deal with it. It could also be useful in Mozilla's advertising to those demographics.</description>

      <title>"Restore to Factory Defaults" feature to remove customizations</title>
      <description>I've heard this idea being passed around without a bug, so here's a bug to discuss in. This is all the stuff that I've heard talked about -- for general discussion. I'll add my own comments in their own line. Feature: a Restore Factory defaults/Restore factory settings/Restore default settings/Set Defaults option. Safari has this feature in their Safari menu. What this would do is remove user-set prefs, customizations, extensions and export-import bookmarks (to remove possible corruption) and usernames/passwords. This would be great for support since it can quickly fix bugs that users may not even want to troubleshoot, they just want Firefox to go back to a working state. It'd also be good for marketing because common Firefox complaints like "eats memory" and "really slow to start up" are often caused by extensions or bad settings which wouldn't be present once we reset to defaults.</description>

It would be better if a webpage could be saved / exported to some other format like PDF, PNG, JPG, or some similar (image/document) format. If one has a pdf printer he/she can print the webpage as pdf, but that is very inconvenient for distrohoppers. If an export feature is implemented into Firefox, then no workarounds will be necessary. One can just go to File &gt; Save as &gt; and choose the format (or perhaps File &gt; Export to ) Reproducible: Always</description>

      <title>Show close buttons when mouse over tab with normally hidden close button</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100115 Firefox/3.6 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729) Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100115 Firefox/3.6 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729) When there is isufficient space to display close buttons on all tabs, only the close button on the currently active tab appears. This feature has the annoying effect that it is impossible to close a tab with a single mouse click without activating it. (Using context menu is slow.) It would be great if the current behaviour would be conserved, but that in addition a close button be shown if the mouse hovers over an inactive tab. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open lots of tabs 2. Close buttons on all tabs but the active tab disappear 3. hover over an inactive tab Actual Results: No closing button is displayed on an inactive tab even when the mouse hovers over it. Expected Results: Tab button should be displayed on inactive tabs if the mouse hovers over the tab.</description>

The tab would then close and a new tab would open showing the home page. Since FF 3.6 the ability to close the last tab has been deactivated. I would like to see the old behaviour reinstated as it was a quick way to clear the screen of the last used website - even if one's UI does not have a home button. (Especially users with small screen often disable the little used home button, among others, to conserve screen estate.) What was the harm in the old behaviour? The new "feature" that you cannot close the last tab is a step backwards in my opinion. Reproducible: Always</description>

      <title>I would like to install an extension without restarting firefox.</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100115 Firefox/3.6 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729) Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100115 Firefox/3.6 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729) As every firefox user knows, there's one feature they don't like. The restart button. Which pops up every time you install an extension. I don't think that there's any reason why every add needs a restart, why a disable requires a restart, and why a update of an add on requires a restart. Obviously, the add on needs to be designed for it, but for most addons that shouldn't be a big deal. Just run the startup or init code, and it's set to go. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.click on add-on page "add to firefox" 2.wait till it finishes downloading 3.restart button pops up on top Actual Results: The restart button will need to be pressed, thereby resulting in up to 30 seconds wasted (the more add-ons you have, the longer it takes). Expected Results: No restart should be available, and should just install the extension and start running it right away. I think that if an extension needs a restart, it should have an option to request a restart. But most extensions shouldn't need it.</description>

If you don't know what Onion routing is then read here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion_routing Basically by firefox having this feature built into it, means people from countries where they censor the internet(eg. china) by blocking certain websites will be able to access these websites again. Currently there is a software called "tor" which can be found at torproject.org that has it's Onion routing software bundled with firefox, but firefox should include tor with it or firefox should have it's own Onion routing feature. The Onion routing feature options could be found where the proxy settings are. Onion routing should be disabled by default. Every time firefox is closed Onion routing should be disabled just in case users forget. Reproducible: Always</description>

      <title>Download ETA still damn lies and cocky about it, discussion and proposal.</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; nl; rv:1.9.2.2) Gecko/20100316 Firefox/3.6.2 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; nl; rv:1.9.2.2) Gecko/20100316 Firefox/3.6.2 Firefox has been ``enhanced'' to show less information while downloading, specifically to say ``a few seconds remaining'' in the last few seconds of download... or hours, as the case may be. This, in short, is misleading and entirely the wrong approach. Here is why: Because it patronises the customer while not helping. It doesn't address the real problem and goes about not addressing the real problem condescendingly. Did I mention that it doesn't actually improve the situation, but belittles the user? In short, don't do a micros~1 by adding more verbiage to make the user feel dumb and in doing so not enhance her experience. Once you can get past that and drop the silly sentence, we can start and look at the problem. The problem is that the numbers are bunk. Alright, easily said, harder to improve. It isn't hard to take the the total time to get this far, divide by the amount gotten so far, multiply by the amount to get, and present that as an estimate. Just say it's an estimate and it's much better than it was already. The airline industry has the ETA TLA for that, and everybody knows what happens to your arrival time when you get stuck on an airport in a snow storm. Or when a TSA goon looks at you funny at the border. Might land you maced and in jail, but I digress. So, taking an overall approach to measuring ETA, would be more useful than what there is now. But I'd also like to know what happened in the last few seconds. Firefox already takes a short-term approach and gets that wrong even without the silly sentence: On this here extremely bursty link at the edge of wireless reach it'll show a KB/sec rate that changes when things arrive but stays the same (and the ETA stays the same!) when between bursts. Meaning that the ETA is about threefold short at best. IE it takes three or more times longer than firefox promised. And since this is endemic for the entire download, you can't really go about replacing the numbers by a silly sentence. You'd have to say something mealy mouthed like ``possibly entire days remaining, perhaps maybe less'', for the entire download. That is why the current solution is infuriatingly unhelpful. So present two numbers: An overall estimate and a number that shows what's going on with the link, say a moving average over the last five seconds. Present as time or rate or both, configurable, so max four numbers. But at least do update the rate display when it dropped to 0, which firefox does not do now, making itself an even more blatant liar. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Download something. 2. Look at the pretty numb... text. Stuff. 3. Profit? Actual Results: Downloaded something. Happened to look at the numbers. Got patronised. Expected Results: Less lies, more effort to show what's going on. More intelligent dumbing down for the average user, so that above average users keep lower blood pressure.</description>

This behaviour used to clear the cache without a dialog. Now it prompts the user with a dialog to confirm. It would be great if the developers had included a "[ ] Remember this setting." checkbox so that the old behaviour could be retained. (b) Open links in new tabs. The old behaviour used to be a new tab is opened at the end of the list of tabs. The new behaviour opens tabs beside the current tab. The Tools &gt;&gt; Options &gt;&gt; Tabs menu could have included a "[X] New tabs open beside current tab" checkbox. Unless the underlying implementation is so horrid that it should be wiped off the planet, consider keeping the old behaviour around with a way to re-enable it. Reproducible: Always</description>

      <title>Preload Firefox with a "-preload" switch (New Function)</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de; rv:1.9.2.2) Gecko/20100316 Firefox/3.6.2 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729) Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de; rv:1.9.2.2) Gecko/20100316 Firefox/3.6.2 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729) My idea is to integrate a preloader for firefox by using a switch e.g. "firefox.exe –preload". By using this function firefox will be started but no chrome (windows) will be shown. FF will be only started in the memory. its like the same when I started FF close it and start it again, then FF started much faster. So I can invoke the "firefox.exe –preload" function by starting my OS (WIN32) in my autostart procedure. Thanks for programming Firefox, Andreas Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: Start Firefox</description>

If I copy the image in IE or Chrome, paste works - I can even paste the copied image into an instance of Gmail opened in Firefox. A little investigation shows that Firefox adds the following formats to the clipboard when copying an image: * application/x-moz-nativeimage * DeviceIndependentBitmap IE7 adds the following formats: * UntrustedDragDrop * FileDrop * UniformResourceLocatorW * DeviceIndependentBitmap * HTML Format and Chrome adds the following formats: * HTML Format * UniformResourceLocatorW * Bitmap * DeviceIndependentBitmap * Format17 A little test shows that the element needed to get Gmail paste working is the "HTML Format". Chrome adds the following under the "HTML Format" when copying an image: Version:0.9 StartHTML:0000000105 EndHTML:0000000336 StartFragment:0000000143 EndFragment:0000000298 &lt;html&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;!--StartFragment--&gt; &lt;img src="http://icanhascheezburger.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/funny-pictures-c at-pretends-to-be-a-book1.jpg" alt="funny pictures of cats with captions"/&gt; &lt;!--EndFragment--&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.

But I would like this popup to be appear only when the Login Success. Issue 2: Say for example if i clicked on remember password on site which i logged in successfully, and the user changes his password manually or expired. When he launches the same site again, the browser popup with remembered user/password, but as its older password the login fails. So user re-enter the same user-id and the new password, this time the login successful. In this Case the browser has to have capability to update its existing entries. This is very Generic issue irrespective of sites. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: For Issue 1: 1.Launch a site ex: linkedInn or gmail.com 2.enter Correct username and wrong password. 3.Click Login 4. You will see a popup on top as soon as you click login/send/submit. For Issue 2: 1.Launch a site ex: linkedInn or gmail.com 2.enter Correct username and correct password. 3.Click Login 4. You will see a popup on top as soon as you click login/send/submit. 5. Click on Remember password. 6. change your password and apply. 7. close the browser and relaunch. [just to avoid automatically login for changed passwod] 8. launch the site again, You will see that remembered user and password already populated in to the feilds. 9. when you click on login it fails to login since you have changed the password. 10. Now enter the new password and login.this logins fine, 11. But this will not update the existing entry for the same user of same site. 12. you can verify this launching the browser and try login. Expected Results: Remember password should have capability to handle authentication state success or failure and update existing password when user successfully logged in.</description>

      <title>Please provide user setting for disabling BACKSPACE navigation behaviour</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de; rv:1.9.2.2) Gecko/20100316 Firefox/3.6.2 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729) Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de; rv:1.9.2.2) Gecko/20100316 Firefox/3.6.2 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729) There are many discussion in bugs from back to 2001 to today on the BACKSPACE behaviour. There seem to be people that like the current behavior as a shortcut for page back. This also seems to be the accepted behavoiur among browser implementors, I found Opera, Chrome and IE behaving the same way. OTOH, all "average users" I know do not use Keyboard navigation, but expect the browser to act as they know it from word processors, mainly if they are inside a form, be it a web mail application or community thing or whatever. Those kinds of applications have gained an increasing importance since the disucssions on BACKSPACE began. I myself just lost an hour of work because of this behavior, my wife complains at least once a week about lost e-mails because she hit backspace and had not noticed the text field had lost focus. This IS a serious problem and a permanent source of annoyance about their browsers for many users. It could easily (well, from a user's POV; I don't know about the implementation) be solved with a checkbox in the general settings, saying: "Do not go to the previous page when hitting BACKSPACE". Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open a Yahoo mail account and klick the "New message" button 2. Type something into the message field 3. Click anywhere outside the message field and hit Backspace Actual Results: You are redirected to the previous page; if you hit the Forward button, the text is lost. Expected Results: I would expect nothing to happen, if the focus is not in a text field, textarea or other editable area. Please do not look at this submission as a reopening of the discussion on the correct behavior of BACKSPACE. This is a real and serious problem for a significant number of users, please give us a choice to adjust this key to act as we expect it.</description>

There is very minimal work involved in doing this because there is already an emulator that allows Windows XP software to run on Windows 98/Windows ME called KernelEx( https://sourceforge.net/projects/kernelex/ ). So firefox could develop a Windows 98/ Windows ME(Millenium) installer that integrates KernelEx, so when firefox is run, KernelEx will run with it, and when firefox is closed, KernelEx will close too. You should modify KernelEx so it is only applied to firefox and not any other software on a user's computer. You should also make sure the adobe flash 10 plugin detects firefox as Windows XP so the users can download the latest version of the adobe flash plugin and other plugins. By the way, KernelEx is open source. Do you think you could do this? Reproducible: Always</description>

      <title>Session restore functionality is broken by captive portal software</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9.1.5) Gecko/20091116 Gentoo Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9.1.5) Gecko/20091116 Gentoo If you have saved your session in a Mozilla web browser (eg: Firefox, Seamonkey), the functionality is broken if you are behind a captive portal system or proxy that uses authentication with a web form (such as Novell). After being disconnected, the user is prompted to login to the captive portal again on all of their tabs. As a developer of captive portal software, it would be nice if there was a *standard* way that I could report to web browsers that a captive portal is intercepting their request, and that the user should prompted to login on only *one* of their browser tabs, and then the captive portal reports back to the browser once the user is logged in again to restore the remainder of their tabs. So for pages that result in being put in a captive portal login page, the following header could be set: X-Captive-Portal: login-required X-Captive-Login-URI: https://captive.example.com/login/ And once the user is logged in, another HTTP header can be sent: X-Captive-Portal: authenticated And then the login window can be closed and the tabs restored. The browser could mimic the behaviour of Microsoft's Network Location Awareness service by attempting to connect to a site like http://www.msftncsi.com/ncsi.txt (except have the page hosted by Mozilla, eg. conntest.mozilla.org) as a connection test to prevent an external website from sending those headers fraudulently. The system should also provide a ribbon or other notification in order to allow the user to force the browser to restore the entire session regardless of what the server reports, an option to disable captive portal detection, and also to support captive portal implementations that do not use these headers. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open some websites in tabs and save your session. 2. Log out of a captive portal. This can be as simple as a timeout causing it to occur. 3. Attempt to restore your session. Actual Results: The session is generally entirely lost, and there are login prompts on every tab. The ability to restore the session depends on the captive portal software in use. Expected Results: The browser should detect the presence of a captive portal and prompt for a login once before restoring the remainder of the tabs. Additional custom captive portal states could also be supported through this mechanism, to be checked on browser startup through the ping-back mechanism. For example: X-Captive-Portal: disabled X-Captive-Message: You have exceeded your internet quota usage. Please visit the captive portal page in order to purchase additional quota. X-Captive-URI: https://captive.example.com/top-up/ A captive portal software could send a notification to the browser that internet access has been disabled for some reason, and a URI to visit for more information.</description>

      <title>avoid duplication of entries in autocomplete results</title>
      <description>Since bug 480350 landed, the list of loaded URLs is included in the autocomplete results. URLs which are in history (or bookmarks) and also loaded in a tab show up twice in the autocomplete results. This often causes some duplicated entries in the dropdown (one with the URL, one with "switch to tab") and makes the URL bar harder to use for me: I'm quite used to loading URLs by typing phrases into the location bar and selecting the first/second/third URL in the list. This usage pattern breaks when entries are duplicated in the list, depending on which URLs I have currently open in other tabs (i.e. it is not predictable what the second or third item in the dropdown will be).</description>

It is by design if the restored ones should get at the beginning or at the end, but its a must that no tabs should be removed.</description>

      <title>Can not toggle "Special Characters" window open/closed.</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; en-US; rv:1.9.3a4pre) Gecko/20100330 Minefield/3.7a4pre Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; en-US; rv:1.9.3a4pre) Gecko/20100330 Minefield/3.7a4pre While running Litmus test cases (Testcases - : FX 3.6 BFT - Menus), I found incorrect behavior for "Special Characters" on Mac OSX. Menu should be a toggle open/closed. CMD+ALT+T will open Special Characters, but should also be able to close Special Characters. Able to close the window fine using the red OSX close circle in the top-left corner of the Special Characters window. To see an example of this functionality in OSX, open TextEdit in Rich Text Mode and press CMD+T to toggle Font window open/closed. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open FF/3.6 or FF/3.7a4 on OSX 2. Press CMD+ALT+T to reveal Special Characters 3. Press CMD+ALT+T to hide Special Characters Actual Results: Special Characters window does not disappear when you press key sequence in step 3. Expected Results: Special Characters window should disappear when you press key sequence in step 3.</description>

      <title>Web page error not trapped and when FF closed, FF process stays open</title>

When FF is closed, it does not in fact close but leaves firefox.exe process running. IE complains about the error on the page and doesn't get itself hung up. The web site with the offending page is http://www.nutmegpwd.org/ but since I don't expect their page to be in error forever, I have attached the page source as www.nutmegpwd.org.htm Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.go to web page 2.click on first hotspot - probably no result; if there is close newly opened window and try step 2 again 3.close FF 4.check running processes to see FF still running Actual Results: FF is hung up with process open. Expected Results: Would have expected FF to close completely - at least. Prefer the IE approach which signals that there is an error on the web page and refuses to process it. I'm going to call this an enhancement / others might differ. It has wasted an hour of my time tonight.</description>

Web forgeries are designed to trick you into revealing personal or financial information by imitating sources you may trust.

It might be expensive on some pages with a lot of links but it seems like we could be scanning the page content of loaded pages and putting up an infobar when the page content contains URLs on the blocklist. The infobar might appear and say something like "This page contains links to possibly dangerous content at domain.of.site.com " (click here for more information) We could add this as an extra defense layer first as an option, then then maybe turn it on as default if we can figure out how to mitigate noticable performance drawbacks.</description>

It would be nice to have a way to disable such animations, either one by one or all together. This can be useful for constrained environments, and also as a personal perference, as moving things can be quite distracting. To give an example outside of Firefox, GNOME's window manager "metacity" has a "reduced resources" mode that similarly disables all animations. Reproducible: Always</description>

The problem is that even though my monitor is fairly large, with great resolution, I can't really make out the tab screenshots. It's true that the title appears below the tabs, but when you look at different files in github (for example), you pretty much get the same title for all tabs. What I'd like to see is some sort of a peak option for tabs. maybe zoom in a little to tabs on-mouse-over. I'm not a UI person, so I can't say if this is a good solution, but whatever might be able to improve tab selection could be great. Reproducible: Always</description>

Firefox is terminated abnormally (for example, when I restart to apply Windows Updates and Explorer kills Firefox because it's popped up the "Save session?" dialog). When I reopen Firefox, it correctly shows the "Restore Session" tab with all the windows/tabs I had open. I want to continue browsing on the last page I was at, *without opening all the other saved windows/tabs*. I can do that by ticking only the appropriate page in Restore Session, and clicking the "Restore" button, but then I will lose all the other windows/tabs I was browsing, as Restore Session then closes. So what I'm basically asking for is a way to selectively restore windows/tabs *without having Restore Session go away afterwards*. IMO the easiest way to do this would be allow right-clicking on tabs (not windows, for obvious reasons) in Restore Session, and then popup the same context menu that appears when you right-click a hyperlink in a web page.

      <title>Make Tab Candy view more intelligent with highlighting.</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:2.0b4) Gecko/20100818 Firefox/4.0b4 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:2.0b4) Gecko/20100818 Firefox/4.0b4 Because the thumbnails in the Tab Candy main view are constantly moving around and changing size, it is difficult to visually remember where each tab is located on screen between uses. This defeats the purpose of the component in that the user is not always allowed to make judgments based on their spacial memory. I mainly use Tab Candy to change between panels/tab sets, and so when I activate the component I don't wish my current panel to be centre focus. A more intelligent design could be achieved with the following: 1. Maintain one size for all thumbnails under normal conditions. Wrap thumbnails predictably but do not scale them when user drags the corner of a panel. 2. Highlight the current tab more prominently, while retaining subtlety, when entering the Tab Candy screen. 3. Highlight the tab last used from each panel in a different colour to aid "task switching". 4. Allow user to use key commands more effectively. For my ideas on this see Results section. Reproducible: Didn't try Actual Results: Activating Tab Candy screen shows thumbnails of all different sizes, sometimes in different positions. The current tab is subtly highlighted in blue, which is barely visible, and this focus highlight can be moved with the arrow keys but does not respond to hovering with the cursor. The focus highlight can be easily lost among many tabs. It is difficult to locate the desired new tab quickly as user's attention is drawn to current tab, adding an extra thought layer. CTRL + SPACE is a simple activate command. Repeating the key command reopens the last used tab. Holding CTRL has no effect. User can use arrow keys to navigate to a new tab and then press ENTER or CTRL + SPACE to switch. Expected Results: Activating Tab Candy screen shows thumbnails of the same size and always (where possible due to wrapping) in the same position. The current tab is subtly, but obviously, highlighted, but the last used tab from each other panel is highlighted in a different colour assisting the user in quick "task switching". Focus highlight is vibrant and jumps to last used tab in last used panel and responds to cursor hover and arrow keys. Highlighting becomes intuitive after just one use as user recognises current, previous and cursor highlights. User's attention is drawn to previous tab rather than current tab, encouraging quick and fluent "ALT + TAB" like activity. CTRL + SPACE activates the Tab Candy screen, and holding CTRL and repeatedly pressing SPACE cycles panels (not tabs). The cursor highlight always jumps to the last used tab in any panel. Releasing CTRL switches to the focused tab. Releasing CTRL immediately allows arrow key and mouse key functionality similar to how Tab Candy currently works. Holding CTRL allows user to navigate using arrow keys, releasing CTRL to switch. Slow users can activate &gt; navigate &gt; switch with isolated gestures; power users can activate, navigate and switch all with one keyboard gesture. The above is not a perfect solution, but hopefully you will find it useful!</description>

      <title>RFC: Please make creating of user profiles less confusing in 4.0 than it was in 3.X</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:2.0b4) Gecko/20100818 Firefox/4.0b4 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:2.0b4) Gecko/20100818 Firefox/4.0b4 enhancement, no bug, see below Reproducible: Always This is NOT a bug report. It's a sort of RFC to make the final 4.0 better than 3.0 ever was. It's just a major annoyance that I've experienced in both 2.X and 3.X versions through all those years. I just kept quiet about it because FF will always be WIP, so I expected something to happen in this section! But nothing happened, ever. To put it bluntly, for newbies (as which I sometimes act myself, too, to understand problems that new users might run into), creating user profiles is just a NIGHTMARE, especially if you decide to put the user profile somewhere else than a Micro$oft tool would do it (i. e. everything on the C:\ drive) The UI is much too less intuitive, even though you might think differently about it. We'll start from the beginning, step by step. 1. firefox.exe --profilemanager 2. "Create Profile" 3. "Next" 4. Enter new profile name: &lt;whatever you wish&gt; "You user settings, preferences and other user-related data will be stored in:" 5. "Choose Folder..." 6. NOW PRETEND YOU ARE A NEWBIE and just choose your folder, as you would do with any other software, e. g. D:\FFProfiles. However, what the new user thinks is: It will work like 1000 other kinds of Windows software, too. "Sure thing, Firefox will store the profile into D:\FFProfiles\&lt;whatever you wish&gt;". WRONG !!! FF will put ALL of your data DIRECTLY in D:\FFProfiles. User clicks "Finish", and thinks everything is all right! Now imagine the new user has a girlfriend, using his PC on another account. Surely he wants to do a profile for her as well. AGAIN, HE IS A NEW USER. He's no tech-savvy person that thinks it's the easiest thing of the world to remember the "Create New Folder..." button which FF provides on the "Choose Folder..." dialog. So, what will happen? He'll do a profile for her, and ASSUME it would be created in D:\FFProfiles\&lt;girlfriend's_own_profile&gt; Again WRONG! Firefox will mercilessly OVERWRITE her boyfriend's data with hers! Everything will go into the root of D:\FFProfiles\. So ... Either make it a standard behavior, that if ... - user enters a profile name AND - user chooses a folder on another location the profile will be stored in &lt;chosen folder&gt;\&lt;profile name&gt; instead of cramming all of it into the root of &lt;chosen folder&gt; as 2.X / 3.X did it!! EVEN MORE HAZARDS: THREE users are using this machine, one tech-savvy, the other isn't. - The tech-savvy one creates his profile in E:\UserProfilesFirefox\, CLICKS THE NEW FOLDER, and all perfect, his new profile data is kept in E:\UserProfilesFirefox\techSavvyGuy. - The non-tech-savvy one learns from the tech-savvy one the following wish: "I'd prefer that all our profiles be stored into E:\UserProfilesFirefox". "OK," the other answers, and in "Choose Folder", he selects "E:\UserProfilesFirefox", BUT DOES NOT click "New Folder", but instead just clicks "OK". Sure thing! Firefox will now keep the techie's data in E:\UserProfilesFirefox\techSavvyGuy, but the other guy's data in E:\UserProfilesFirefox !! NOW A DEVASTATING THING MAY HAPPEN. Think that the non-tech-savvy guy gets tired of Firefox, wants to use the browser with the red oval O henceforth, and says "OK, privacy rules! Let's delete all my profile data". You guessed it. FIREFOX WILL NOW DELETE EVERYTHING, including the tech-savvy-guy's data which is in the subdirectory!! The techie will be very happy if he has a backup. So you see, how dangerous it can be to share a PC if the UI allows you to purge another user's profile with your own one, because FF gladly puts user data in the specified root directory instead of root\individual_subdir. OK, that's enough now, sorry for the horribly long post. But maybe it will bring up new ideas to make 4.0 "idiot-proof" =) OVER.</description>

Panorama could replace this extension except for the fact that unlike Panorama the extension allows me to hibernate groups – the tabs are unloaded from memory and the extension saves their URIs to disk. It would be great if Panorama could hibernate and restore tab groups; this would allow heavy users of tab groups to separate currently-used groups from groups kept for future reference (as well as keeping currently-unused tabs out of memory). Reproducible: Always The extension I use is TabGroups Manager (https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/10254/).</description>

      <title>Tab previews in Panorama should load based on size</title>
      <description>Aza has often noted that the size of a tab group (and its related tab previews) is directly related to its importance. If that's the case, then the larger tab previews in the larger tab groups should load first, followed by the smaller ones. (In other words, they should load in decreasing size order.) Currently, they appear to load at random. One good way to view this behavior is to restore a session with a large enough number of tabs in a large enough number of groups, all of different sizes (including those reduced to stacks—which should be the lowest priority when previews are loading). During the first opening of Panorama, almost all tab previews will be loading for the first time.</description>

      <title>Add ability to copy URLs of to-be-restored pages in Restore Session</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.11) Gecko/20100701 Firefox/3.5.11 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.11) Gecko/20100701 Firefox/3.5.11 Feature suggestion: Allow someone to select one or more entries in the Restore Session list and do either Ctrl/Cmd-C, or right-click -&gt; Copy, and have the URLs of the tabs copied to the clipboard. This would mirror the same functionality in the Bookmarks manager (Library). Since there does not appear to be a right-click pop-up for entries in the Restore Session list, this would not impact existing functionality at all. I thought of this suggestion because I'm testing Firefox Beta 4 and accidentally started FF 3.5.1; I don't want to lose all my to-be-restored tabs from FF 3.5.1 when I install and start FF Beta 4, and copy-paste into a text file would solve that problem nicely. I can imagine other situations where it might be good to be able to copy the URLs of multiple to-be-restored tabs at once, for example if you have to move to a different computer but want to continue churning through the tab list figuring out which you can restore and which you don't want to (just copy and paste into email to self). Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: Right clicking on one tab in the Restore Session tab does not bring up a context menu for copying the tab's URL to clipboard, and Ctrl-C does nothing. Also, it's not possible to select more than one tab in Restore Session with Control or a range with Shift (for copying more than one tab's URL at a time). Actual Results: Unable to copy URL(s) to clipboard. Expected Results: Would like to be able to copy (via keyboard shortcut or right-click menu item) URL of a tab in Restore Session to clipboard. Would also like to be able to select more than one tab in Restore Session with Control/Command or Shift. Both of these would make Restore Session's tab list behave more like the bookmark manager Library, which allows selecting multiple bookmarks and copying their URLs to the clipboard.</description>

      <title>Add Live Filter Search to Panorama</title>
      <description>There are two types of information retrieval: (1) browsing, and (2) searching. The former is for when you know roughly for what you are looking or where to look but not exactly what you are trying to find. The later is for when you are looking for something very specific. Panorama excels at the first mode of information retrieval but currently lacks the later. By adding a find-as-you-type interface we solve that problem. A couple design goals are: * Remain unobtrusive (no new info-clutter) * Feel extremely fast * Key-stroke level complete * Be lenient of typos</description>

F.e. I'm a web developer &amp; I host several domains on one hosting. Every time I go to hosting's login page (or to the login page of hosting's phpMyAdmin, etc.) I must select login manually (Form History Control shows dropdown list in "Login" field). It's not so handy as it might be. I cannot create one bookmark to one account, and one to another. The suggestion is to support "binding" a group of field values to bookmark. When bookmark is created all filled fields (except passwords) are stored along with URL. When bookmark is loaded the stored fields are filled, then Form History Control tries to fill password fields in compliance with already filled ones. The suggested feature gives to Firefox additional flexibility and would be useful not only in authentication issues. Reproducible: Always</description>

Webpages could be saved into a new directory named after the tab group and tabcandy/panorama could author a small index.html file for the collection that would serve to re-add the tabs to a running firefox instance. This would have many uses. Users doing research or looking for instructions on a task could search widely, pull quality content into a tab group, and save it locally for reference when trying to re-learn or re-research that same information later. Task-focused users could save and load their collections of tabs depending on the day's agenda without having to be distracted by tab groups that they worked on yesterday but won't work on again for a week. If you are very visual, you could use these tab collections to replace your bookmarks.

      <title>Need smarter policies for searching with location bar.</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:2.0b6pre) Gecko/20100903 Firefox/4.0b6pre Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:2.0b6pre) Gecko/20100903 Firefox/4.0b6pre Awesomebar could do web searches by modifying the keyword.URL. Since the landing of bug 565966, however, it's now a default action. Compared to Google Chrome's omnibar, we need to come up with smarter policies for determining the type of input string(text or link?). Most problems happen when there are dots(periods, full-stops) in the string. Here are some things I noticed: 1. Since each field of an IPv4 address is a number between 0~255 and there are only four of them in a set. Strings like "1.2.3.256" or "1.2.3.4.5" are recognized as normal strings and bring up search in Chrome. For now Minefield still thinks they're addresses and tries to connect, this one is a rather easy fix I suppose. 2. For more complicated strings like "a.b.c.d.e" and "a.b.c.d.ee", Chrome seems to have its mysterious way to distinguish them. Take the above two for instances, "a.b.c.d.e" is treated as a string, "a.b.c.d.ee" becomes an address(and "a.b.c.d.ff" a normal string again). Most basic and easiest way is considering country code top-level domain(ccTLD), but since there's no one as the ".ee" suffix, I suspect Google made up some handsome rule lists using their enormous search and domain database. This one's got to be worked **** if we're going to achieve it. 3. If Minefield can't decide(better yet, even if it could), offer to let the user decide. See the screenie, http://cl.ly/1ccfb94315e1dd6928e5 There are more patterns, and all those will benefit not only search in location bar, but also "Paste and Go" or "Paste and Search", context menu "Search Google for" or "Open Link". Please look into it. Thanks. Reproducible: Always</description>

      <title>bookmarks toolbar should be above navigation bar if tabs on top is true</title>
      <description>OK. I get the reasons why tabs on top make more sense, However given that, it would seem that keeping the navigationbar closer to the content window would also make sens,e so that for the tabs on top case, I would think the bookmarks toolbar should be above the navigation toolbar. However the real solution here, is to have a generalized method to position the toolbars in any order the user desires.</description>

      <title>Show first-run guide for new Firefox 4 everything</title>
      <description>Firefox 4 introduces Firefox Menu, Tabs on top and hide Bookmarks Toolbar by default. As far as I talked with ordinary users, they will surprised at the drastic change and will have trouble with using firefox. What they ask first are almost always "where is the menus?", "where are my bookmarks?", "how to show menus?", "how to switch back to the old style UI?" Until they understand they should click new top-left orange Firefox menu, they cannot open config window, cannot open their bookmarks. If they cannot understand new Firefox Menu soon, they'll stop using Firefox 4. I believe Firefox 4 have to do 2 things: - User must be able to understand new style UI *easily*. - User must be able to switch back to old Firefox 3.6 style UI *easily*. # easily means "without any other person's help" or "without google search" One option to make it easy is, show first-run new page which includes: - How to use new Firefox Menu - How to switch back to old Firefox 3.6 style UI</description>

      <title>Easy way to switch back to Firefox 3.6 style UI</title>
      <description>Firefox 4 introduces Firefox Menu, Tabs on top and hide Bookmarks Toolbar by default. I believe (at least as first) quite many users want to switch back to old Firefox 3.6 style UI. But to do so, currently they must do: 1. notice about Firefox Menu (it's not obvious!) 2. click it and find submenus of "Customize" (again, not obvious) 3.1 make "Tabs on Top" off 3.2 make "Bookmarks Toolbar" on 3.3 make "Menu bar" on If they make "Menu bar" on first, they need to find "Tabs on Top" menu from "View -&gt; Toolbars". This is not easy for ordinary users (at least for beginners). Firefox always introduce new features as users' option. Users should be able to choice if they use it or not. This time, we should provide easy way to switch back to Firefox 3.6 style UI. I think this should be possible on first-run guide page or something like it. # see also bug 593930</description>

      <title>No tabbar mode (use only TabCandy to switch "tabs" without tabbar)</title>
      <description>In short: Whey don't you make possible to disable old style tabbar if you believe tabcandy is better way to manage tabs? Details: Old tabbar is 1 dimension and we cannot easily remember where the specific tab is or cannot easily categorize them. Tree Style Tabs make it easy to categorize but still difficult to remember where the specific tab is. With TabCandy, we can easily remember where the specific tab is since we can keep the tab, top-left or bottom-right for example. If TabCandy is better to manage pages, we should be able to use only it, without old style tab management (tabbar). Users should be able to disable tabbar. "No tabbar mode" is not possible just to hide tabbar but also need some behavior change of TabCandy. For example In "No tabbar mode", when we click on a group (not on a tab in the group) TabCandy should not show previously selected tab in the group. TabCandy should show the tab only when we click on a tab. Even if you couldn't agree with the idea, TabCandy should have flexibility to make this possible by extensions.</description>

He is root, I am just a regular user. We both use Iceweasel. So, when my friend installed the add-on "Vimperator" via "apt-get install" within Debian the next day I was starting Firefox and my address bar and everything was gone because Vimperator was activated. If he had downloaded the extension and installed it for his user, that would not have happened, so I asked him, why he hadn't done that instead and he said the installation of the addon as Debian package is more comfortable because security updates get installed automatically. Long things short, could you please implement, that addons that are installed as root-user do not activate for every user at once? That would be very kind. Better instead would be a dialog that asks the user after the debian package by root has been installed if you really want to activate that. I know how to use VIM so I got that Vimperator addon deactivated really quick but I can imagine simple users would be very confused and would even make barely understandable bugreports. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. get root 2. install addon 3. login as normal linux-user 4. start iceweasel (firefox is called in Debian that way) Actual Results: Addons you never heard of are activated and confuse you. Expected Results: Normal usage of firefox.</description>

But when I am trying to pull a link or picture from a webpage and try to place it between two tabs its not allowing me. I don't think it is a bug, but would be very nice if we can have that implemented Why I need this feature is because when i am searching the net for something I would always like to keep similar ones closer rather than opening one at the beginning of the tab and the next at the end. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.open www.gmail.com tab 2.open www.google.com in the second tab 3.Now from www.google.com click on the doodle displayed and drag it open in a new tab between gmail and google. It will not allow, instead will allow to open it in a new tab only at the end section Actual Results: The tab gets opened only at the last Expected Results: Imagine the case when the user is browsing with 10 or 12 tabs open. it would be very nice if we can provide the user with an option drag and open a link / picture at a place convenient to him/her</description>

      <title>Firefox does not offer 'Open With' action for octetstream mimetype</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.9.1.5) Gecko/20091123 Firefox/3.5.6 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.1.11) Gecko/20100721 Iceweasel/3.5.11 (like Firefox/3.5.11) When clicking on a link to, for example, a PDF file whose mimetype is incorrectly identified as 'application/octetstream', Firefox offers only the option of saving the file, not opening it. It would be better if Firefox opened a dialog allowing the user to choose an application with which to open the file. This enhancement would spare users the trouble of saving, then deleting, a file which they merely want to view, in cases where the filetype has been incorrectly identified by the server. Firefox is already user-configurable to, by default, open this mimetype with a user-specified application. I think it would be useful if the same choice, (minus the option of making it a default action), could be presented to the user upon clicking a link. I realize that the responsibility for this problem really rests with the operators of the offending sites, but it's such a prevalent annoyance that Mozilla would be doing its users a great favour by making it easier to open these mis-mimetyped files. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.Navigate to &lt;http://www.cycle-helmets.com/cyclingreport_timgill.pdf&gt; 2. 3. Actual Results: A dialog box appears which says: "You have chosen to open Irresistible.pdf which is a: PDF document from: http://policy.rutgers.edu Would you like to save this file?" There are only two choices: cancel, or save the file. Expected Results: A dialog box should appear, saying: "You have chosen to open Irresistible.pdf which is a: PDF document from: http://policy.rutgers.edu What should Firefox do with this file?" This should be followed by radio buttons to select either 'Save', or 'Open With', with a pull-down list of available applications, but WITHOUT the checkbox for 'Do this automatically for files like this from now on'.</description>

      <description>Currently, the switch to tab feature indicates that it will be switching to a tab, but not what group that tab is in. From Unfocused: only obvious thing i can think (that doesn't abuse toolkit with browser-specific stuff) of would be to attach a binding to richlistitem[actiontype="switchtab"] .ac-url-text, and have that binding walk up the dom tree to get the url from the base richlistitem binding. From me: I believe the easy way to get the group for the tab is, given a xul:tab: aTab.tabItem.parent.getTitle()</description>

      <title>"Single window" mode for Firefox</title>
      <description>This bug suggests implementing a "single window" mode for Firefox, where every web page was a tab in the same top-level window. Turning it on would change the behaviour as follows: - Ctrl-N instead does a Ctrl-T, and equivalent for other access points - All JS-invoked new windows become new tabs (this is, I believe, currently true in some cases anyway) This suggestion was provoked by the news that the "all windows" version of Panorama is not going to ship in Firefox 4. I think such a mode - which solves the problem of making Panorama cover "all windows" by having only one window - would be a useful substitute and possibly much easier to implement. I'll _want_ Panorama to include all my tabs - and so multiple windows becomes an inconvenience rather than a method of organization. I now have a new, better method of organization. And yet sites, and my own muscle memory, will sometimes create new windows when I'd rather they/it didn't. This feature would prevent that, thereby making Panorama work much more smoothly and reliably for me. I am not familiar with the code, but I know we already have code and prefs to determine when a new window is created and when a new tab, and perhaps it would not be hard to make that code choose "new tab" every time. Would this be a significant amount of work? Gerv</description>

      <title>Alternative display mode for tab groups based on favicons+window title</title>

In those cases the favicons/window titles are fare more useful than the images. In those cases displaying those near-useless images takes up space that could be used to display more of the window title instead. An excellent example would be a tab group full of open bugzilla entries. They all look the same, they all start with "Bug XXXXXX", so the first few words of the title aren't enough, so neither an except of the title nor the thumbnail are useful. Just favicon (as quick visual guide)+full window title would be far more helpful. So my suggestion is having an alternative display mode for tab groups that is similar to the dropdown menu in the tab bar. Reproducible: Always</description>

      <title>Add a way to temporarily run a clean session without blowing away your previous session</title>
      <description>I've wanted this for a while but never got around to filing; recently Emma brought up this issue too, and when I mentioned it in the newsgroups there were several people who "me too"-ed. Consider a situation where I have a browser session with a bunch of tabs. I quit the browser. Then I want to check something really quickly, so want to start the browser but not restore the saved session and also not lose it. Bug 588482 provides a way to not restore on startup, but it sounds like quitting will blow away the saved session and replace it with whatever it was you were looking up quickly. So this is a request to have a way for that not to happen. Right now I end up popping open some other browser when I'm in this situation, but of course then I don't have my awesomebar, bookmarks, cookies, certificates, etc. I have absolutely no idea how to surface this in the UI in a sane way. :(</description>

As it is, if you just start typing it will do the search, but I didn't discover that until I banged my keyboard in frustration. (Which was actually probably the only time in history where that has actually helped.) Anyway, I think that the already-existing keyboard search shortcuts will be more discoverable for keyboard users. Reproducible: Always</description>

      <title>Add a method for viewing/managing sound in Panorama</title>
      <description>Currently it is difficult to get a global view of sound in the browser. An &lt;audio&gt; or &lt;video&gt; element obviously lives within a particular document, and therefore a particular tab. However, the experience of the sound these make goes beyond the tab metaphor: as a user I am confronted with any/all sound at once despite my current tab, and in order to manage it, I must be able to switch from my global experience of sounds to particular tabs. The "which tab is making that sound" problem is well known, and universally despised. I wonder if Panorama might provide a useful user abstraction for solving this. If I can step back and see all my tabs at once, why not the sound I'm hearing? This would require some way to display a sound, and a way to get from that sound to the tab making it (or at least a way to pause/play it). I have no idea the right way to solve this. I realize sound coming from Flash is not really in a tab (there is only 1 instance of Flash shared among many tabs). This makes &lt;audio&gt; and &lt;video&gt; more compelling, since it becomes possible to control them with more precision (i.e., I might actually want a song playing in one tab while I watch a movie in another vs. a global on/off switch). Panorama may or may not be the right target for this (I have some ideas about exposing back-end data from media elements so UI can provide hints for users). But I thought I'd open the discussion for the post-Firefox 4 time frame.</description>

      <title>Option to not load tabs from inactive groups on initial browser startup (and until such time as the tab(s) become part of an active group)</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0b6pre) Gecko/20100911 Firefox/4.0b6pre Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0b6pre) Gecko/20100911 Firefox/4.0b6pre A problem with current TabCandy implementation is that it loads all tabs -- including those in inactive groups -- into memory, on browser startup. This, to an extent, defeats a perceived benefit of TabCandy and creates a problematic disconnect between what a user may expect and what is actually happening. I ran into this issue when I noticed that Firefox was consuming over 400 MB of RAM, but I had only a handful of relatively 'light' tabs loaded. I thought something was leaking, but when I was able to reproduce the issue in safe-mode, with a single tab, I finally opened "Group Your Tabs" and, lo and behold, I had hidden tab groups that Firefox was all-to-happy to load into memory -- even though they were not being used. This is quite problematic, because some users, as happened with me, will be under the impression that they can create a whole bunch of tab groups -- that will be accessible to them sometime later when they want -- and not have to clutter and bog down the browser with many tabs, not realizing that the latter will continue to occur. It would be nice if the default behavior is to load only the tabs in the active group(s), initially, and to have an option so that those who want to always load the whole mess can so choose.

      <title>Provide visual indication of Switch to Tab override</title>
      <description>This was discussed a while back, and I'm not sure what became of the discussion. Beltzner requested I file this bug anew, to ensure it doesn't get forgotten. The new Switch to Tab feature automatically detects when a particular URL is already open in another tab (when typing the location bar). It then gives you the option to switch to that tab, rather than accidentally duplicating it. However, there are times when that duplication is intended, especially if (for example) the tab it wants to switch to is in another Panorama group than the one you're currently working in. There is already the option to open that result in a new tab by holding down Alt/Option when selecting it. However, that then removes focus from (and effectively orphans) your already-open "New Tab" tab. Also, the pressing of the key does not change the appearance of the "Switch to Tab" portion of the result (which itself replaces the URL). There should be a key command (e.g. Shift or Control/Command) that allows you to override the "Switch to Tab" feature while also visually reflecting that keypress onscreen.</description>

      <title>Arrow keys should not skip app tabs in Panorama</title>
      <description>Seen on nightly builds of Minefield for 20100915 While in tab view, use the arrow keys to cycle through tabs. App Tabs are skipped. I suppose with the implementation that app tabs are shown in all tab groups, makes this correct behavior. However, I think app tabs should be arrow'd to in some way. Perhaps app tab display is over-redundant, by including them in *every* tab group. A couple thoughts I had on this was. Make a distinct group for app tabs. (just make sure they all appear in Browser view with any group of tabs) Or Display App tab icons only in the focused group in Group View.</description>

      <title>When page has feeds, add feed handling to the "Add Bookmark" panel</title>
      <description>This is an idea from Mike Beltzner from bug 578967 comment 73. Filing for him because that bug is a bit messy now and I'd like this idea to not get lost. (Mike Beltzner [:beltzner] in bug 578967 comment #73) &gt; I'm happy with the approach in comment 71, though I'd prefer if there was also &gt; a way to add an RSS feed from the "Add Bookmark" panel, and when RSS is &gt; available, have the "Add Bookmark" panel show on the first instead of the &gt; second click. (Dave Garrett in bug 578967 comment #75) &gt; Neat idea. It would add some good discoverability in a new and natural way. (Dietrich Ayala (:dietrich) in bug 578967 comment #76) &gt; agree with Beltzner that a nice bookmark panel UI &gt; would make the change more palatable. (Dave Garrett in bug 578967 comment #83) &gt; (In reply to Alex Faaborg in bug 578967 comment #81) &gt; &gt; &gt;Moving feed awareness to the add bookmark panel seems like a &gt; &gt; &gt;welcome compromise here. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I don't see how that is better than the patch here that moves it to bookmarks &gt; &gt; menu (both one click, although this one is always one click instead sometimes &gt; &gt; one click, and it doesn't create user data as a side effect of inspecting if &gt; &gt; the feed exists). &gt; &gt; You go to the bookmarks menu to open a bookmark. &gt; You go to the add bookmark pane to add a bookmark. &gt; &gt; When adding, that's when you'd probably like to be told about a feed you might &gt; want. &gt; &gt; Putting some indicator in both places makes sense. (Alexander Limi (:limi) in bug 578967 comment #96) &gt; (In reply to Dave Garrett in bug 578967 comment #95) &gt; &gt; So what then about Beltzner's suggestion from comment 73 to tell about RSS in &gt; &gt; the create bookmark dialog and open it on first click? New bug for that? &gt; &gt; Yes, let's handle that separately. Getting this into Firefox 4 is more &gt; important than having the additional functionality and convenience that would &gt; add.</description>

It basically works like the old Help&gt;Check for Updates. From a usability standpoint, this open up another dialog box infront of a second one to simply check for an update. What should probably happen is something like chrome. You click "check for updates" the button dissapears and a spinner replaces it along with the text "checking for updates" somewhat like in the new AOM. If no updates are found, it says so. if an update is found, then it can give the update banner like it currently does.</description>

      <title>Drag and drop to create/remove app tabs in Panorama</title>
      <description>according to the spec: http://www.flickr.com/photos/azaraskin/4946904112/ ... you should be able to drag and drop tabs into and out of the app tab strip in Panorama. This feature didn't make it into the initial landing of app tabs in Panorama, and at this point I think it may be too late for FF4.0, but I'm entering it into bugzilla for completeness.</description>

I do think that it would be more sensible to move the SRG button to the left and Larry next to it. Also the button should be a bit bigger (wider). The point of putting it to the left is that from my experience users tend to use Enter for what the Go button does but very often use the Reload button rather than F5. Putting the SRG button close to the back forward buttons makes the GUI more intuitive regarding the way the typical user uses the GUI. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.use a nightly trunk build 2.realise stop-reload-go is on right side Actual Results: it's on right side Expected Results: left side is more logical and user friendly.</description>

The thumbnail contains the content, but the area includes the navbar and other chrome. So, the Chrome has to move out of the way somehow. Fading it out might prove difficult since it's merged with the OS window background, but an easy way out would be overlaying it: Make the TabCandy window start out overlaying the content area, then smoothly resize it to cover the browser chrome as well.

The point is to have english as default input language for new tab and save used language for each tab. IE8 provides this feature out of the box. There is an addon for Firefox that does this, but: 1) it doesn't work in 4.0 2) it is an essential feature that might be availiable in Firefox itself. Examples of usefulness: 1. You are searching something with Google in your native language and want to open some site -&gt; you have to change the language, because URLs are in English. There would be no harm from a feature I'm requesting. 2. You always use english for about:config or any English forum and always use russian for some Russian sites. Saving input languages would help you save your neurons. Thanks sencerely. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: Change a tab or open a new tab Actual Results: System input language stays the same, it is saved for the whole Firefox without regarding to the content Expected Results: System input language should be stored for every tab separately (like in IE) and English should be used for new tabs as URLs are English (at least, for now) This feature could be switchable in Options or about:config.</description>

      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/534.3 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/6.0.472.59 Safari/534.3 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0b6) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0b6 Related to Bug 587440. Agreed: showing previews for every tab in hidden tab groups can get unwieldy and breaks the use case for tab groups. However, hiding the hidden tab groups completely from the OS makes Tab Groups more of a closed hierarchy (windows &gt; groups &gt; tabs) and requires that a user navigate the OS window manager and the browser tab manager (Panorama) to get to a hidden tab. Bug 578512 alleviates this a bit but requires that I only use the browser chrome to get to hidden tabs. The OS can't get me there. Requested change: Add an option to "Show previews for hidden tab groups in the Windows taskbar." Desired behavior if option is checked: Show a single preview for each window and tab group (ordered by window/group/tab). User click on a preview brings the associated window and tab group into focus even if it was previously hidden. Desired behavior if option is unchecked (default?): Continue showing every tab as a separate preview if "Show tab previews in the Windows taskbar" is checked. Perhaps hide tabs from hidden tab groups if bug 587440 is implemented. Reproducible: Always</description>

      <title>Show tab count after group name</title>
      <description>In the Panorama view, one can see at a glance previews of tabs within each tab group, as well as the names of each of those tab groups (if named). One should also be able to see an exact number of how many tabs are in each tab group. For example: Mozilla (23) Shopping (15) Group 3 (32) Read Later (12) Also, if the group name is ever used anywhere else, the tab count should probably be included there, too. (For example, "List all tabs" menu, session restore, window title bar, etc.)</description>

However there is something which is very weird for the user : if i use Panorama to create several groups of tabs, only tabs of the current group are shown in the tab bar and there is no way to know that there are several other groups of tabs. Therefore once i've finished to read tabs in the current group, i may close Firefox without remembering that it remains some other tabs. Firefox should display the information that it remains other tabs in other groups. Some suggestions : - Use the title bar : i.e. "25 tabs in 3 groups" could be display in the title bar - add an indicator close the panorama button, i.e. 25/3 (means "25 tabs in 3 groups") thanks Reproducible: Always</description>

It is a essential feature which if added, will greatly enhance the usability of Firefox for power users (who typically might have 50 to 70+ tabs open). This might also be a 'Advanced' preference. Please do not close this bug, saying that this does not make sense to be builtin since it is already available as an addon until you've tried the addon for a few hours/days first. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open firefox, load 70+ tabs, a good number of them with flash 2. Watch firefox memory consumption and general responsiveness (for instance when switching tabs) 3. Install the BarTab addon and restart the browser 4. Follow the steps 1. and 2. and notice the difference Actual Results: Without the abilities of BarTab Firefox feels sluggish Expected Results: Firefox should be the coolest, fastest and most usable browser for anyone out-of-the-box (ie: without the need for installing BarTab)</description>

An option to "lock" fullscreen mode would be desirable. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Navigate to a .swf link or a fullscreen html game. 2. Switch to fullscreen mode in Firefox. 3. Move your mouse to the top of the screen while playing the game. Actual Results: The address bar or some other menu slides down and messes up your game. You cannot play games fullscreen without risking messing up many times. Expected Results: If Firefox had a "lock" mode, then nothing would happen - no menu would slide out. I do think this feature has big implications for gaming using the browser. The is not suggesting a permanent Kiosk mode. Instead, what I have in mind is that you can only exit fullscreen using some very specific commands. I'm not sure of the best way to work it into the UI, but here's the general concept. 1. When you enter the "locked fullscreen" mode, the user is presented with a dialog that tells them how they can exit fullscreen (perhaps by pressing "Alt+Enter" or "F11" or ?). Note: "Alt+Enter" seems like a good key combo since it is the common method for exiting fullscreen in many apps. 2. Alternatively, the dialog could present the option not to enter the locked mode. 3. Other OS specific keys would still exit fullscreen (windows key, alt-tab in Windows, Alt+F4, Alt+Enter etc...). Note Bug 462628 could offer a solution; however, I feel that this issue is important enough for the general public to include as a more prominent preference or feature.</description>

      <title>On or Off status bar.... Should we have a third option?</title>

It's the only time that i use the status bar, to see the URL of the link i'm hovering on. I think that many people of the community do that too. So the 3 options for the status bar should be on, off, Appear when hovering link only. Thats not truly a bug but a great improvement i think ! Reproducible: Always</description>

      <title>[Add-ons Bar] Turn the statusbar element into a toolbar widget (or wrap it in one)</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:2.0b7pre) Gecko/20100923 Firefox/4.0b7pre Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:2.0b7pre) Gecko/20100923 Firefox/4.0b7pre The Add-ons Bar seems to be there as a place for add-ons to put their status icons. To that end, the Add-ons Bar tries to act like the "system tray" rather than a toolbar. However, the statusbar/statusbarpanel paradigm seems to work perfectly fine for that, and I see no reason to replace it. So, my suggestion would be to turn the statusbar element in to a "Status-Bar" toolbar widget (or wrap it in one), and have that be the proper place to have status icons. This way, there's no change from the classic status-bar, contextually or add-on implementation-wise. However, now the user can place these status icons/controls anywhere in the UI they desire. Then treat the Add-ons Bar as a regular toolbar (though maybe locked in 'small icons' mode), and have the default widgets be [Flexible Spacer][Status-Bar] Reproducible: Always</description>

We sit down only to find that the previous user has screwed things up. It would be great if there were a general "restore default settings" button available in the menus. Note however often libraries set the Homepage and we don;t want to mess with that, so perhaps make restoring that harder. Reproducible: Always This bug is not for some part of Firefox, unlike other bug reports here, but for the entire thing.</description>

      <title>Remove "Delete" and "Select All" from context menus on Mac</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:2.0b6) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0b6 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:2.0b6) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0b6 The context menu in the location bar and in form elements in Firefox for Mac contains the same options as the Windows version. Namely: Undo, Cut, Copy, Paste, Delete, Select All (and "custom" contextual options). However, context menus on Mac generally only contain: Cut, Copy, Paste (and custom options). I haven't researched whether these options are explicitly encouraged by the HIG, or merely a de facto standard. In any case, "Delete" and "Select All" feel quite misplaced (in lack of a better word) since there are several other ways of selecting and deleting text. While the "Undo" option feels non-Mac as well, since undo in Firefox is not app wide, but rather contextual (i.e. selecting "Undo" from the "Edit" menu only undo the edits in a particular form field), keeping this deviation might be appropriate. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Right click (or Ctrl click) in a form field or the location bar. Actual Results: The context menu shows Undo, Cut, Copy, Paste, Delete, Select All (and other contextual options) Expected Results: The context menu should show Cut, Copy, Paste (and other contextual options). And perhaps Undo as well. Removing these two (or three) options would reduce clutter and make Firefox feel more native in Mac OS X.</description>

      <title>Show Panorama view on holding ctrl+tab</title>
      <description>The Tab Candy / Panorama hotkey is being set to ctrl+E in bug 592183. Suggestion for (an additional) more natural shortcut: HOLD ctrl+tab (shift+)ctrl+tab cycles through tabs. Pressing it a bunch of times jumps through a bunch of tabs. Holding it for auto-repeat just runs through a bunch without much control. Instead, we could intercept the attempt to auto-repeat and use that as a shortcut to open Panorama. It would actually make sense as an extension of the existing shortcuts.</description>

      <description>There isn't a good way for somebody to quit using Firefox sync. I know that we all want them to keep using it but in the case where somebody is using a public computer or loaner computer, it would be nice to have a button for them to delete their profile and clear everything in it. History, passwords, prefs, and bookmarks.</description>

      <title>Offer a non-permanent profile for public sessions</title>
      <description>When you are on vacation and still want to access your bookmarks and password, you may be interested to use Sync to get your data. But as you use a public session, you don't want your credentials to be stored in Firefox, nor do you want someone else to access your data once you are done with browsing. What would be useful, IMHO, is a kind of private session for Sync, i.e. it immediately flushes all your data and credentials once you click some "end private session" button (or even after some time of inactivity, for security reasons).</description>

      <title>In default theme Tabcandy and Add-ons should match color scheme of default theme</title>
      <description>I wish Firefox had only one color scheme and appearance across on all OS. But that is not the case now, color scheme and appearance changes with OS and depend on OS theme. But strangely on default theme Tabcandy and Add-ons have different color scheme, also differ from color scheme of the default theme. This is very irritating as I use Windows Classic theme on XP, Vista as well as when I used Win7. So 1. Use same color scheme for Tabcandy and Add-ons 2. If possible match OS color scheme. I know there is bug 591652, but what about when user is on Windows Classic theme, like at work place we have Windows Classic theme.</description>

      <title>a way to change or disable Tab Candy shortcut / disable TabCandy completely</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:2.0b6) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0b6 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:2.0b6) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0b6 A way to change the shortcut (as of 4.0b6 - CTRL-Space) that launches Panorama is needed. On many systems, CTRL-Space is the default shortcut to switching input methods, not to mention muscle memory associated with code completion and similar activities in other applications. Another thing would be a way to disable Tab Candy completely (so not only it won't start when the shortcut is hit, but it won't be doing any background work). As a person running &gt;50 tabs per window, I find Panorama more annoying than helpful compared to my own setup, and from talks with other people, I'm not the only one (most of the people I talked with would take TreeStyleTabs over Panorama any time). Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Hit CTRL-Space to change input method 2. get panorama instead Expected Results: Preferenced dialog should have options to change Panorama shortcut and/or disable Panorama completely.</description>

For example: This Saturday's update (02-Oct-2010) caused my x64 build to crash on startup. If I could start it on Sunday (03-Oct-2010, after the updates have been published) with something like: "firefox.exe -updatefirst" so that it would go retrieve an update, install it, and then start Minefield, hopefully the new update would contain the fix. If no update is found, a message saying that should be shown before trying to start Firefox. This would help users having to a full manual update once the fix has been identified.

My idea is that a new tab page could be created with a very similar system to the awesome Panorama (previously TabCandy). It would have all the same functions, but instead of being populated with active tabs it would be user-defined links. As well, it would be persistent across sessions. It would also have to have some visual distinction from Panorama so as not to confuse. Such an implementation of a new tab page would be relatively easy to implement (because the resources are already present), and it would be unique and useful. Reproducible: Always</description>

When you start typing it automatically sorts suggestions to either change tabs, or suggests history and/or bookmarks depending on a few factors. The first few things, which should be easy to implement : Let the user decide what FF suggests when you start typing and in what order. ie Do you want FF to suggest History, Bookmark, Switch and in what order they show up. The second thing is automatic url completion. There should be an option that lets the user specify whether they want FF to auto-complete the url for them. Auto-completion would be based on most used websites. This way you don't have to hit the down arrow key then enter to access a website.

For example, not matter default enabled Java Scripts, but if have possibility to define exception with www.dumaalmas.hu webpage with disabling entire Java Script running entire only this page, this is good for me. If possible, need a gui control to handle this new situation. Attila Reproducible: Always</description>

      <title>please allow one entry per visit in History Library</title>

For example, if I opened https://bugzilla.mozilla.org at 1:00 and https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=xxxxxx at 1:10, I probably spent about 10 minutes filing xxxxxx. There is one important problem with the History Library doing that: a URL is only showed once. So for example, if I filed 2 issue reports today and xxxxxx was the first, I wouldn't see the 1:00 access to https://bugzilla.mozilla.org in the Library. Instead, there is a Visit Count and a Visit Date for each URL, but this doesn't really help in my use case. It's worth noting that showing a "Visit Date" for several visits is wrong, this should probably read "Last Visit Date". I would like to be able to show all visits individually, optionally.

      <title>Bookmarking long URLs are truncated without warning</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; en-US; rv:1.9.2.10) Gecko/20100914 Firefox/3.6.10 FirePHP/0.4 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; en-US; rv:1.9.2.10) Gecko/20100914 Firefox/3.6.10 FirePHP/0.4 The URL above produces an innocent SVG clock with Javascript that makes it "tick". I converted the page contents to a single "data:image/svg+xml;base64" URL. The URL is long, maybe longer than standards recommend, but it works in Firefox (and Safari, FWIW). When I click on the star icon in the Location box of the toolbar, it appears that a bookmark was created successfully. I can click the star a second time to alter the bookmark name and tags. However, when I access that bookmark, it is truncated. FF did not give any warning that the bookmark would be truncated. Also, when I go to the bookmark organizer and edit the properties of the bookmark, it lets me enter the longer URL, apparently without trouble. However, the URL is still truncated upon access in the brwoser. Reloading the bookmark properties in the organizer reveals that it's truncated there, too. Again, FWIW, Safari has no problem making a bookmark of this long URL. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Access a very long URL, like the data URL for the SVG clock with Javascript. 2. Attempt to bookmark the long URL. 3. Access the bookmark to find it has been truncated. Actual Results: The truncated URL results in an incomplete document. FF reports: XML Parsing Error: unclosed token Location: [omitted here due to length] Line Number 269, Column 7: &lt;path ------^ Expected Results: A ticking mechanical clock in SVG.</description>

Whenever the user enters a password in a page, check this against a database. If the password does not belong to this domain, warn the user ("This is NOT Amazon, but you just entered your Amazon password"). We would need a database storing URLs/Domains, password hashes and some salt. Whenever a password field is about to be sent, check in this database for the hash. If a hash is found but does not match this Domain, warn the user. The database is trained with each successful login. This could only get tricky if the user uses one password on multiple domains and the browser is not trained yet (fresh installation). This way the user will get one warning to check the URL first for each new Domain where he is logging in. Reproducible: Always</description>

      <title>Notify user when non-compatible version of Flash is used w/Private Browsing</title>
      <description>Versions of Flash prior to 10.1 do not clear associated Flash history for a Private Browsing session when that session ends. When a Private browsing session is started, and a version of Flash earlier than 10.1 is in use, users should be warned that they are using a version of Flash that does not support Private Browsing, and/or that their history may not be cleared. Ideally, users will also be given additional information about the current available version of Flash, and the opportunity to update to that version (MAYBE tie in information from the plugin check and/or PFS source).</description>

      <title>Make history menu length configurable</title>
      <description>Noticed this aspect of my interaction with the History menu, thought it would be worth capturing. I inevitably want to go back to the 11th item in my History, which isn't displayed in the menu. Show All History is clunky and unwieldy; two more clicks and an extra window to find the item I want. My modern LCD display isn't lacking in space. If I had my way, I'd hit about:config, find browser.history.displayedEntries, and change it to 30 from 10. 10 is fine as a default to avoid crowding new users. This bug: make a config entry for this limit, and make the History menu obey it. (If I get really motivated, I'll grab this for myself...!)</description>

The problem is more unpleasant when you restart your browser and have forgotten half the tabs opened. You have a hard time to find which one has sound or makes the whole restart slower.

While I know I shouldn't e.g. enter bank passwords or other sensitive information while on an unsecured public wireless network, I sometimes forget whether my connection is 'secured' or 'unsecured.' HTTPS also provides some protection on some sites, but behavioral control is the most effective - and could be even more so with a little reminder from my browser. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Connect to a public wireless network. 2. Access a website requiring password login or entry of other sensitive data. 3. Send the sensitive data. Actual Results: Anybody within wireless range can pick up the packets and steal your information, particularly on non-https connections. Expected Results: A small notice in the corner and/or information bar, or maybe even something more intrusive (like Firefox's phishing or security warnings) to remind me this wouldn't be the best place or time to conduct that business online. This might be technically challenging because it requires Firefox to communicate with the OS and find out what network connection it's currently using, and whether that is secured or unsecured. Be sure that in implementing this, you don't open security holes that would allow attackers to specifically leverage unsecured networks. The security risks associated with using "secured" wireless networks are not zero, but may be significantly less than on unsecured networks, particularly if the user knows &amp; trusts the set of other people with access to that network.</description>

While I appreciate the favicons in each tabgroup, the group in which new tabs opened by an app tab is confusing and (at least for me) leads to a lot of rearranging tabs. (more prose omitted) The idea: - Get rid of the app tab favicons present in each group. - Place each favicon on the [left|right|bottom] of the panorama view in a little container similar to the close button. - Create a 'hidden' tabgroup for each app tab, optionally named as the TLD - When an app tab is selected, mark the associated tabgroup as active. - When in panorama mode, all app tab groups are hidden - When in panorama mode and the user hovers over the favicon, the associated tabgroup rolls out. If the favicon is clicked on, active the app tab itself. - Unpinning an app tab simply removes the icon from the list but keeps the tabgroup alive Expected benefits: - Similar to how the Mac dock works - Similar to how the Win7 taskbar works - Users always know where child tabs of app tabs will open (instead of opening in the arbitrary active group) I'll attach some images to help my mediocre wording along.

I reported it as such however it got me thinking that these scams try to look like official Windows screens. Surely like photocopier manufacturers adding software to stop you copying money, the browser could do the same to prevent this type of scam. Adding the Bayesian spam filtering used in Thunderbird you could determine a probability that a page is a scam. You get a whitelist from bookmarks and current history, you get blacklists from a rbls and brand new sites get scanned for key words or images. You can then output a warning to the user. Making the Internet safe again. Reproducible: Always</description>

Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. create an app tab, e.g. using http://www.cnn.com 2. in the app tab, navigate to some sub-page (e.g. an article on www.cnn.com) 3. close and restart the browser Actual Results: The app tab displays the last page/article displayed before the browser was closed. Expected Results: The app tab should reload and display its initial URL, e.g. http://www.cnn.com in the example used above.</description>

But it's weird that everytime I need some privacy, I have to close all other tabs I've been working on. So feature request: Private Tab, those "private tabs" keep no record on local machine while "normal" tabs work normal. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: Annoying Procedure: 1.viewing some tabs, and somehow want to see some pages preferred them keep no record 2.private browsing.....blah......tabs I'm brownsing close... 3.mubbling: WHY I can't private browsing at the specify tabs? Actual Results: I got upset...especially sometimes starting private browsing means close 20+ tabs Expected Results: A private tab feature.</description>

For example, in the options menu, one should be able to set "apptab:http://www.google.com|apptab:http://mail.google.com|http://reader.google.com" Gmail and Google would be opened in app tabs, and Reader would be opened in a regular tab. Also, if a user has app tabs open and clicks "Use Current Pages" in the options menu, it will be given the app tab identifier. I think this would bring more usability to app tabs, so they don't have to be set every session. Reproducible: Always</description>

      <title>"Get Add-ons" "Learn More" link should at least cause the new Tab "on top" if not focus it</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.13pre) Gecko/20101030 Namoroka/3.6.13pre ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET4.0E) Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.13pre) Gecko/20101030 Namoroka/3.6.13pre ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET4.0E) The "Get Add-ons" "Learn More" link should at least cause the new Tab created by clicking "Learn More" to be "on top" (if not focus to it) so give feedback that clicking "Learn More" actually worked and to present you with the info that it provides. It is unlikely that the user would click "Learn More" if the did not wish to do so thus there is little purpose keeping the newly created Tab 'not on top' (end of the list if using Tab Mix Plus) were it is 'hidden' from the user. Surely after having clicked on "Learn More" the next thing you would want to do is goto the Tab. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Menu: [Tools][Add-ons] on "Add-ons Pane" [Get Add-ons], and search for anything. 2. Click on one of the 'Search Results' to expand it and click "Learn More". 3. Did the click work ?, click again, hmmm. Now if you manually focus to the new Tab (I have TMP installed with "multi-line-Tabs" enabled) you would have two Tabs opened. If clicking "Learn More" causes the Tab to be "on top" (yet under the "Add-ons Pane") you could at least see part of the information that was not obscured by the "Add-ons Pane" (thus clicking from one result to the next, and each "Learn More" to each "Learn More" for 'quick details') _WITHOUT_ actually focusing the Tab, yet having it "on Top", (yet under the "Add-ons Pane" is likely the most desirable mode of operation. Alternately, put the newly created Tab fully "on top" (above everything, even the "Add-ons Pane") and let the user chase back to the "Add-ons Pane" if they are fickle about their quest for knowledge. I feel this is a lesser desirable mode of operation yet might be "the more expected" mode of operation (more conformist to "standard HMI", yet less helpful in this circumstance). Actual Results: After clicking "Learn More" it is not obvious that your click was accepted nor is the effort of clicking rewarded in any visible manner. With Tab Mix Plus multi-row-Tabs you need to scroll down to the end of your 'tab list' to get to the newly created Tab. Expected Results: Described in STR. RFE. This is for "the exit" as opposed to bug 580537 which is for "the entrance".</description>

I propose that Firefox should treat HTTPS websites with self-signed certificates as if they were normal websites i.e. no pretty icons/colours to reassure the user of security, but no "DANGER! DANGER!" warnings either. This would allow websites to at least use the encryption element even if the identity of the server is not verified. Alternatively, maybe a red padlock, or some other warning that doesn't require several clicks and a lot of confidence to get through. Reproducible: Always</description>

I did this by selecting the last ~two-hundred entries and rightclicking / selecting "Remove from list". This resulted in the entire browser going into an unresponsive state, both the Download dialog and the main window were locked until the selected entries were removed from the list. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Downloads lots of stuff to fill up the download list. 2. Clear part of the list. (The Clear List button seems to work instantly?) Actual Results: Browser goes unresponsive for the duration of the 'remove' operation. Expected Results: At least the main window should stay responsive by running the remove task in separate thread? Better would be to have the download dialog itself remain to be responsive as well but showing some sort of 'removing selected download entries' indication.</description>

After a crash, click on the restore button (in the "This is embarrassing" page) : tabs are restored in background but foreground doesn't change during a few long seconds, until the 1st tab is effectively loaded and finally replace the "This is embarrassing" page (in my case the tab is Gmail). From a user point of view, not having immediate feedback, especially in such circumstances (trying to restore from a crash), is not good. I suggest to replace the "This is embarrassing" page with a blank page (or blank page with a "please wait" message) immediately after the user clicked on the restore button, without waiting that the restored tab is effectively loaded. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.Load a lot of tabs and make Firefox crash. 2.click on the restore button Actual Results: wait during some long seconds before being able to get feedback Expected Results: firefox should provide immediate feedback (i.e. replace the "This is embarrassing" page with a blank page or display a "please wait" message) until the tab is restored</description>

Open www.microsoft.com in the first tab. 3. Open a new window using CTRL + N. 4. Navigate to www.ibm.com in the second window. 5. Close all windows. 6.

There is a lot of useful discussion in that bug about the way the OS marks the default action on the screen, and I don't want to sidetrack it, so I am opening a new bug. This is a suggestion to prevent data loss in a slightly different situation. If the user has interacted with the list of tabs to be restored, typically unchecking some of them, and still hits the "Start new session" button, it can probably be assumed that they did not intend to, and would be happy to see a "Are you sure you want to start a new session?" dialog asking for confirmation. If the user did not interact with the list, no dialog is needed, as they probably (though as bug 477322 will show, not necessarily) intended to start a new session. Reproducible: Always</description>

We want to find which of these home pages contain any of several keyphrases we specify (e.g. "natural language processing" or "computational linguistics"). To do this, currently we have to open all these home pages as new tabs and manually try each keyphrase in Firefox's Find Text toolbar. Therefore, I suggest that Firefox's Find Text toolbar have an option "Find in all tabs" which searches all opened tabs for the given text to find. Reproducible: Always</description>

      <title>Delay status updates for links further</title>
      <description>To find a balance between not needlessly distracting users an letting them check the link target when they want to, we should consider delaying status updates for links further. The update currently happens when the mouse has rested for 70 ms over a link. I've been playing with 500, the same delay we use for tooltips, which felt okay to me.</description>

      <title>Use longer hover link popup for long URLs</title>
      <description>An example really long URL: http://www.google.com/search?q=thisisalongurltestaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa12345&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:unofficial&amp;client=firefox-a Hover over the above link in current Trunk and it'll truncate to fit into a popup bubble half the width of the browser in the lower left. Since we're now showing this on top of content rather than in a fixed space in the status or location bar, we've got more room to spare. We should at least show as much of it as we can so the user is more informed. There's no need to truncate it if we have the room. Really long URLs are a known potential spoofing path, so showing as much as possible is potentially helpful in this area. (e.g. long URL with real URL it'll redirect to at the end) That being said, really long URLs that can't fit onscreen are also doable. Doing a marquee similar to what I suggested in bug 596802 might help with that, but that'd be another bug. Using 100% of the browser width might be too much. Maybe up to 80% or so?</description>

If moving the URL bar closer to the browser area is an important improvement of FX4 then the personal bookmarks toolbar should not be underneath it, as it has no page specific elements. Also, during navigation, the tab bar is used a lot more than the bookmarks toolbar, and it has a stronger relationship to the current page. That's why propose the following default order of toolbars, from top to bottom: Menu Bar Personal Bookmarks &lt;========&gt; Tab bar URL (Navigation Bar) Also additional (User defined) toolbars should be inserted between Bookmarks and Tab bar - the tab bar should never move away from the URL bar!

      <title>Allow multi-dimensional tags views</title>

Bookmark tags are great stuff because one can assign a bookmark to more categories than if using directories/folders. Using directories/folders it is possible but one has to make copies of data. This is the strong side of tag over folders. However if to use tags as implemented currently the creation of flat flags structure only is possible. The tags structure can arise in one dimension only. Directories/folders do not show this weakness! If to enable the tag to get other tag or more tags assigned to it will be possible to build up two dimensional tags structures. Tags without any other tag/tags assigned to appear at the top-level of this structure. Tags with other tag/tags assigned to them appear deeper in this structure. How deep the particular tag appears depends on the tags been assigned to it. If to use this enhancement one no need folders any more to organize the bookmarks. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: See "details". Actual Results: More tags defined. If to show them all in the bookmarks menu, a flat structure of all tags appears. Expected Results: Two dimensional structure of defined tags appears. The tags are powerful as folders/directories are. They are even more powerful than folders, because one can assign an item to more categories (here tags) without doubling the object. See "details".</description>

      <title>vertical space user interface improvement: floating expandable navigation and bookmark toolbar</title>

Firefox interface could make use of this feature and further save vertical space for web content by adding a "floating" behavior to the navigation and bookmark toolbar that expands and shrinks when the mouse moves in and out of the tab bar. I've attached a very rough HTML sketch of the idea described above. The sketch also demonstrates a "pin" function/behavior that prevents the toolbar from shrinking and pushes the web content below the toolbar (basically, reverting back to the current interface). Positive impact: - saves vertical space - further places focus on web content Negative impact: - site identification (grey/blue/green) is less visible and at times hidden, increasing risk of phishing attacks (workaround: i/ site identification hint can be added to tab itself, ii/ floating toolbar appears while page loads and remains for a few seconds after load completed) - not applicable for touch screen navigation / tablets (workaround: add show/hide toolbar button to tab bar) Reproducible: Always</description>

      <title>Status panel is hard to see when the page has lots of text</title>
      <description>Created attachment 515075 [details] screenshot So, I know my eyes have issues, but I find the new status panel barely visible, indeed I often have to stop for a moment to be able to read it. The first problem is that it's hard to visually distinguish it from content, the fact the test is not black also doesn't help. The screenshot attached is a extreme example where both problems cohexist, but I currently notice this issue in a lot of different pages. I guess if we could find a way to make it better readable.</description>

It is cumbersome to remember to go to the Minefield / Firefox menu every time to restore the session, if necessary. Reproducible: Always</description>

As it is now, if you have just 2 groups with say 30 tabs and want to see the tabs inside each group (say to rearrange between them or to create a third group) you have to enlarge groups so much that you have already taken up all of the available space. Even if you keep groups at the bare minimum size you can't have more than that many groups. Another thing I would add is a "send to" feature to send one or more tabs (selectable say via check-boxes) from one group to another group or a new group. Reproducible: Always</description>

PROBLEM: On a webpage someone has posted a link in plain text, but no html (or other code). E.g. http://www.despotovic.com/pages/book02/ Procedure of User: Mark Link blue, Copy, Paste in another freshly opened tab. IMPROVEMENT: User marks text-only-Link blue - right clicks with mouse on the marked Link - (now the new function) navigate this Link (new item in the context menu) Also a kind of Link autodetection could be programmed (mouse cursor position - text in this line analysed for hyperlink properties). This would save the marking of the link) Sorry again I did this under bugzilla, but that was the easiest way at hand. Greetings: Burki Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.none, see above 2. 3.

Earlier, the three Maximize, Minimize &amp; Close Buttons were also not selected while moving cursor to the extreme top but I experience that now in this beta I can close the browser by moving my cursor to the top and then clicking.

      <title>Create a subsection in the appmenu for extension menu entries</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0b13pre) Gecko/20110228 Firefox/4.0b13pre Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0b13pre) Gecko/20110228 Firefox/4.0b13pre Create an area (another vbox with a catchy id i.e.: id=Extention_area, tools_area or something) in the Appmenu to house Appmenu-items of add-ons and encourage developers to use it. References to other bugs: I know, in Bug 599779 - "Create a submenu under "Add-ons" for extension menu entries" this has been declared to be a wontfix. Bug 578844 - "make app menu fully accessible to add-ons" has a similar purpose. Reasons: I know it's late in the development, but with landing of the final release, more add-on developers will patch their add-ons for FF4.0 and will copy items of the tools-menu to the Appmenu. My experiences with the tools-menu is, that it gets cluttered really fast and that the add-on items are allover the place. If not provided with a place to put them, they will appear in the Appmenu by the developers judgment. This could be a serious matter and difficult to be corrected afterwards, as at that point the add-ons have been updated and then may be standing as they are. Adding a vbox has several benefits: 1. It's simple and shouldn't break anything. 2. It makes it easier for developers to place items. 3. It prevents chaotic cluttering. The items will come one way or another. 4. It makes add-on items easier to find and manage overall. At point 4.: If an item has been placed under that node, it's a rather simple task to identify it. Creating a manager, that toggles the visibility of the items and keeps the cluttering in check, would be a piece of cake. The alternative way would be to check the appmenu-tree for non-standard items. This might be important, as it is, like mention in the reference bugs above, a bad thing to be purely at the mercy of the add-on developers. Possible design: Quite simple. The only item in it by default could be a menu separator. If it's empty it can be collapsed or not displayed. If you want an even simpler approach, place the Web developer item within it. This way it's always filled, ergo always visibly and on the top of it, this doesn't change the current look of the menu. It would be also possible to give another background color to the area (without the separator and web developer, of course), to make it simpler to spot, that those items are belonging to extensions. Ranting: So far I only saw one extension, that placed an item into the menu. "Session Manager" places it in dependence of appmenu_webDeveloper. The position is perfect. The best one could do, but the way of doing it, is still pitiful. Please have mercy. More chaotic approaches will surely come and bite us into our... You don't want to create another sticky nickname like "Awefulbar", do you? The Application "Look-whats-today-on-the-)menu, or something. Reproducible: Didn't try</description>

See the attached Screenshot (with hovered State) for Comparison after Landing of Bug 570279. Toggling Tabs on Top &lt;-&gt; Bottom make no Difference. As you can see, the Button shifted 2px to the right. I'd suggest putting it back those 2px. Moreover the Tab Strip Height could be +/-1px, so that the Button has equal vertical Spacing to the Strip's Borders (now uneven 5/4px). Another Idea would be to resize the whole Button Shape and make it bigger (15/16px?).</description>

While local installs of Firefox have the ability to warn the user of this (*pre*-upgrade), APT managed installs do not. This is a major annoyance because I rely on certain extensions to make the internet not suck, and some of them are not in active maintenance. I often avoid upgrading Firefox on new minor and major version bumps because of this. Major versions bumps are especially bad because they may result in changes to datastore formats, and downgrades are not guaranteed to protect my data. The result is that I have to back up my profile before upgrade, do the upgrade, check if anything important broke, and if so, downgrade and restore. The only tricky part here I can see here is that there *may* be multiple users with Firefox profiles on the system. An upgrade warning should *not* by default list out the extensions that each user may have new version incompatibility with on upgrade. However, I am confident that the developers can work out a solution that balances user privacy with sufficient reporting. Reproducible: Always</description>

And a lot of pages (30-50-100) in the background can make even 8gb/4core computer work too slow. What do I propose: add something like "Freeze Page" functionality for each individual page. It will be something like "take page screenshot, remove all page content from memory and place screenshot instead of page". no java, java-script, flash or anything else, even no links, pure screenshot with all information on page. How it can be used? Simplest way is "Freeze"/"Unfreeze" button. Load page, then click "Freeze", when after 1 or 2 days of idle this page become needed - just to "Unfreeze" or Reload page. More complicated way is something like "Auto-freeze". With some tunable parameters like "not active page for last N minutes" or "Page on non-active tab-group", with list of tunable exceptions for pages like mailers/social networks, etc. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: this is just a FR Actual Results: this is just a FR Expected Results: less resource-hungry application this is just a FR</description>

I need it on the browser window toolbar because: I do research, I work on a large (30") display with two or three browser windows open at once. Tabs don't cut it, it need multi windows for side by side comparison. It is awkward to use bookmarks when you have to jump back and forth and constantly check to see which browser window is selected. We lost a lot when we no longer had the ability to delete, file and edit bookmarks bookmarks on the fly in the menu with a right click. I have managed to make reasonable work-arounds using add-ons and patches to Foxfire 3.X. I won't be able to test 4.0 until I can do the same to it. Why not restore the elegant and powerful bookmark system of Mozilla/Seamonkey to Firefox? Thank You (PS: I tested pre 1.0 release Mozilla for many versions.)

      <title>Web Console should pretty-print stacks</title>
      <description>I'm not sure exactly what either the API or the GUI should look like, but developers like me could really benefit from a way to pretty-print JS stacks. It's important that the API not require an Error object, since I want to use serialized stacks from other contexts (in particular, stacks generated on the server-side). Maybe an API like this? console.logException(label, stack); would put the label in the console, with a little arrow to the left of it, and when you click on the arrow the stack is shown, pretty-printed. So, a call like this would make sense in the console: try { foo } catch(e) { console.logException(e.name + ": " + e.message + " at " + e.fileName + ":" + e.lineNumber, e.stack); }</description>

      <title>Not always the restore sessions works automatically</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; pt-BR; rv:1.9.2.15) Gecko/20110303 Firefox/3.6.15 ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729) Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; pt-BR; rv:1.9.2.15) Gecko/20110303 Firefox/3.6.15 ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729) Sometimes I loss all my opened tabs. I don't know exactly the reason but I saw when my wife opened a new window (new instance) of Mozilla Firefox while my window stayed opened. So she closed my window (previous window), she did works, and soon closed the her window too. One day later, when I opened Firefox, all the tabs of my wife came in. I lost all my tabs and this was a big pain of head. I suggest the creation a new button on top of window (or menu item) where the user can save all the tabs opened (links) and to give a name to this saved session (the system will save the links in a file, for example). This way, since the previous user causes the lost of all the tabs of previous session, I can click in other menu item where appears all the saved sessions by name and choose one. Immediatly the Firefox will open all the links from that session. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open an new instance of Firefox (window) 2. Open several links 3. Open a new instance 4. Open several links 5. Close the first window 6. Open more some links in second window 7. Close the second (last) window Actual Results: When I open a new window I loss all my tabs previously opened (in first window mentioned above) Expected Results: Allow save all the links in a file named by user to restore later.</description>

I am talking about the arrow which exists in the 3.x version right next to the back button. When you press that arrow, you get a list of previously visited pages and you can go back to the page you visited 10 pages ago. This feature is ESSENTIAL because many webpages force you to stay on their page by not letting you go back simply by pressing the back button. Reproducible: Always</description>

In Firefox 4.0 when you right click, Open in New Tab is the first option down. So it is irritating for users accustomed to opening in new tab when they instead open in new window. Solution: Remove Open in New Window completely, and give user the option to show it. Rather than cause unnecessary frustration for users upgrading Firefox 4.0 it should be removed by default, as explained here: http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-remove-the-open-in-new-window-option-in-firefox/ Reproducible: Always</description>

Close/restart Firefox Actual Results: Named Tab Groups are gone. Expected Results: Named Tab Groups should still be there. I argue that if I went to the trouble to give a group a name, it better be there for me later. I think that the tab groups go away because I clear history on exit. But I need to do that as a developer to be sure that my applications aren't cached. However I still want to use tab groups to curate the web. If there was a separate checkbox in Tools-&gt;Options-&gt;Privacy-&gt;Settings for Named Tab Groups, we'd be set.</description>

      <title>[RFE] Firebug should be included in Firefox, or perhaps Gecko</title>

I see FF4 has the web console, but it's just not the same. The reason it surprises me is that Chrome and Safari (by way of webkit) and Opera include firebug-like tools by default. Furthermore, firebug was the first of this type of tool and continues to edge the others to varying degrees. One final note: this is obviously up to the Firefox devs, but it's possible this bug would be more appropriately logged against the engine (Gecko) as opposed to the product (Firefox), as Chrome and Safari's chosen rendering engine (WebKit) is what provides them with their similar tool.

The behavior introduced within many hours of work via bug 587908 was removed in bug 541656. I liked the “old new” behavior better. Because it separates Firefox from other browsers in a positive way and the address bar is the most logical position for the potentially next address, I’d like to have this as an option. Let the users decide what they like better. The feature is now externalized in the add-on “Link Location Bar,” but that’s too far away for such an useful feature. Reproducible: Always</description>

      <title>The location bar alignment should be LTR, even though the Firefox build is RTL (e.g. Hebrew, Arabic..) — Regression from Firefox 3.6</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:2.0b10) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0b10 Build Identifier: Firefox/4.0rc (This applies only to RTL builds of Firefox). Dear Mozilla, Since ff4 beta 11, all of the urls under the location bar (those that you can see either with the history feature or the switch-to-tab feature) are set in an RTL position, which is rather disturbing. I assume that this is probably done to mimic Chrome &amp; IE9, but you haven't considered the option that they're both doing it all wrong. The RTL positioning just makes absolutely no sense, I would suggest you to construct a poll before such a decision, but now it's too late I guess. If you'll check on the community you'd see that this step has practically zero supporters. (I'm not saying that this should be completely reverted back to the way it was in b10, but at least give the users an option to choose whichever way they think is best for them) I would understand it if the web addresses were written in Persian, but as of now 99% of the URLs are written in Latin characters, so fixing them to an RTL position seems like a completely unnatural thing to do. Hopefully this importunity will be considered, so on behalf of a countless number of RTL Firefox users, thanks in advance. Reproducible: Always</description>

      <title>Enriching panorama with opera's tab stacking feature</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0 Opera 11 has a feature called "tab stacking": http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hqSGGk1YTI&amp;t=28s The idea is to display tab groups of panorama as stacks in the tab bar. Tabs could be dropped onto a stack and so into a group without opening the panorama screen. Switching between groups would also be easier. Example mockup: A group stack is expanded, when clicked on, while the previous active one is collapsed. Expand/collapse buttons are unnecessary. Tab previews of stacks are unnecessary. Dropped tabs are appended at the end of the tab list of the stack. Stacks have to look different then tabs. Stacks have to be shorter than tabs. (Conterintuitive, as the house multiple tabs, but in my opinion necessary. See Contra.) Pro: -Tabs wouldn't disappear from the tab bar, as they are still there, hidden in stacks, but the number of objects in the bar still would be decreased. -Opening the panorama screen for simple tab organizing tasks would be unnecessary. -Opening the panorama screen to switch between groups would be unnecessary. Contra: -Stacks are additional objects in the tab bar, that take more space. (Making stacks shorter than tabs might look ugly, but it might help, too.) Reproducible: Didn't try</description>

      <title>Add "Reveal in Finder" button to download manager (like Safari)</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0 I would appreciate "Reveal in Finder" buttons in the Downloads windows, to match Safari's functionality. I've been unable to find an extension that does this. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: Download a file, go to Tools&gt;Downloads. Actual Results: "Reveal in Finder" is only revealed by right-clicking on a file. Expected Results: A button on the far-right of the file's entry in the Downloads window that opens a Finder window with the file selected, as in Safari.</description>

      <title>[REQUEST] Bookmarks flags to alway open in sidebar/new tab/new window</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:2.0b13pre) Gecko/20110319 Firefox/4.0b13pre Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:2.0b13pre) Gecko/20110319 Firefox/4.0b13pre Actually Firefox bookmarks can be flagged to always open in the main browsing area or to be forced opening in the sidebar. In my opinion (and for my daily usage) it would be far better to extend this behavior with two new options to force a bookmark to always open in a new tab or in a new window. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open a bookmark properties 2. See that checkbox saying "Load this bookmark in sidebar" ?? Actual Results: A bookmark can be forced to always open in FF sidebar. Expected Results: The checkbox should say "Always load this bookmark in..." and it should enable or disable a three-state radio button with the following options: - sidebar - new tab - new window</description>

      <title>Feature Request: Optional Splash on Start-up</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.15) Gecko/20110303 Firefox/3.6.15 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.15) Gecko/20110303 Firefox/3.6.15 I'm thankful that Firefox doesn't try to some sneaky pre-loading trick, but it does take it a long while to map into memory the first round (if the OS isn't prefetching it anyway). Without visual sight of the HDD LED, and the know-how to look at it in the first place, a user might be tempted to attempt to launch the browser again. The end result, frustration. A simple splash image could reinforce the fact that a browser is actually loading. I personally prefer clickable splashes, that disappear when clicked anywhere above their window area.

      <title>Option for 1px border for aero snap or alternative implementation</title>

In the new release this space has been removed (after it was added in an earlier beta). The space around the Orange Firefox button and in the top right is not appropriate for the functionality as it defeats the purpose and doesn't match a normal windows programs functionality. I can understand that you want the tabs to be just as easy to access by them Fitt's law and all but Fitt's law is already in use for the great Windows functionality. Please either: 1. add an option to enable/disable the 1px border for aero snap 2. implement double tap on a tab to perform Restore down/Maximize and when dragging on a tab use aero snap. I am unsure how you would differentiate a desired browser tab tear from a desired drag for snapping or Restore down/Maximize though. Reproducible: Always Actual Results: No Aero Snap Expected Results: Aero Snap</description>

But I can't move the ABP icon. Clicking it causing ABP's menu to come up. I was able to group them another way. The problem might actually be with status bar icons versus toolbar icons. (I don't know.) Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.Install NoScript, ABP, and an addon like InFormEnter such that ABP is to the right of the others. 2.Move NoScript's toolbar button to the addon bar. 3.Attempt to move ABP's addon bar button. Actual Results: Clicking or dragging ABP's status bar icon opens a menu even in customization mode. Expected Results: If users can customize the addon bar, they should be able to rearrange all items. The work around I found is specific to ABP. 1. Turn on ABP's toolbar button and move that to the addon bar. 2. Turn off ABP's addon bar button (still labeled "statusbar").</description>

But I had to completely open Panorama to do so. I believe that a split toolbar button with a drop menu would solve the problem. The left side would open Panorama like normal. The menu would list all groups. Another option would be to make the menu button that already lists tabs to at the bottom list tabs in other groups after a separator. Those tabs would be in sub-menus named after the group. Would you need to enter Panorama to do something other than switching groups? Perhaps. But this would speed up switching groups. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.Create several Panorama groups 2.Attempt to switch groups without entering Panorama 3. Actual Results: Users must enter Panorama even if all they want to do is switch tab groups. Expected Results: Users should have a way to switch tab groups without opening Panorama.</description>

I like the new minimalistic look in Firefox 4, and I'd prefer not to add a big custom button to the main toolbar or up next to the tab bar. Having a button to open a new window allows me to do so in a single click, unlike the File menu. Using the keyboard shortcut (CTRL+N) requires me to move my hand from the mouse to the keyboard, which also slows me down. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Hold Shift key and left-click the "Open a new tab" button on the tab bar. Actual Results: A new tab is opened. Expected Results: A new window is opened.</description>

It only changes the size of button box, but the icon remains the same. It also shrinks my usually (in 3.6.*) big icons from other addons. It seems that mozilla devs decided that nobody needs big icons anymore. Well, i do, because some of them change their status to indicate new content (rss feeds) and now i hardly can see it. I want to be able to use big icons (probably 24x24 as it was), and i want my back button not to turn into oval and stay round while using big icons. Maybe it is possible to center back-forward buttons instead of stretching them. Weird observation: if i have Test Pilot 1.1 installed and "use small icons" unchecked, then it shows big icons (Feed Sidebar, IE Tab + addons) and stretches the back button. Without Test Pilot installed it shrinks all icons and only changes the box around a button, and also back button remains round. So far having Test Pilot installed is the only workaround for me to have big readable icons. Reproducible: Always</description>

Currently, closing the Find Bar requires one evaluate and select one of 3 methods: click on its close box, hit Esc if it has focus, or hit Ctrl+F followed by Esc if it doesn't (Cmd+F on Mac). But once the search term has been entered, there is no more use for the bar display, it only consumes page display space, which is undesirable. Furthermore, hitting Ctrl+G to Find Again and getting a failure opens the Find Bar and moves focus to it, in opposition to the conventional operation of Ctrl+G and requiring another undesirable manual close-Find-Bar procedure. Only Ctrl+F should open the Find Bar; Ctrl+G should only search. In summary, I propose: - Ctrl+F works as-is (moves focus to Find Bar, opens it if necessary) - Enter upon entering a search term moves focus to page body &amp; closes Find Bar - Ctrl+G moves focus to page body and closes Find Bar if open regardless of success or failure (status could be displayed in Status Bar) - Tabbing/mousing focus away from Find Bar closes it Reproducible: Always</description>

These popups are just as annoying as the regular window popups. It would be extremely useful for Firefox to address this new type of popup.

Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.Show the menu bar. 2.Can you move controls onto the titlebar? 3. Actual Results: Users can't control what is on the titlebar other than the title itself when the menubar is shown. Expected Results: Users may start seeing the titlebar as just another toolbar since 4.0 by default shows tabs on the titlebar. I know this might be platform dependent.

It is impossible to do concentrated work in firefox for longer periods because this nasty little beast is flashing and flickering at me all the time, catching my attention! (especially on web pages with dark background!) Please include an option to restore the old status bar, it was by far less distracing and less visually annoying! (or at least include an option to disable the tooltip or make it appear only after a one-second delay). Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: Move your mouse over a link or click it.</description>

      <title>Add checkbox inside Firefox's options dialog for browser.showQuitWarning</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.0; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.0; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0 Since many people seem to have been complaining about the fact that you need to set browser.showQuitWarning in about:config to get the "Save &amp; Quit" dialog back, we should add a checkbox into the options dialog under the "Tabs" panel (where there are already plenty of checkboxes) - maybe something like "Prompt to save tabs on close" or something. That way, if a user wants that option back, they don't have to change about:config or manually use the restore button available in the history menu after starting Firefox to get their tabs back. (A common scenario for me: I close Firefox at night with plenty of important tabs open and forget to go to History &gt; Restore Previous Session in the morning. Then, I later forget all about these tabs.) Reproducible: Always</description>

      <title>Firefox performance enhancements should be enabled by default</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:2.2a1pre) Gecko/20110324 Firefox/4.2a1pre Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:2.2a1pre) Gecko/20110324 Firefox/4.2a1pre Firefox has long had methods to significantly improve its performance, but these have intentionally been disabled by default, in some cases because many web servers did not support them. Set: network.http.pipelining to true network.http.pipelining.maxrequests to something larger, like 30 or 100 network.http.pipelining.ssl to true network.http.proxy.pipelining to true Also, rendering at 100 ms using nglayout.initialpaint.delay 100 has made my browser feel more responsive for years by allowing enough time for most or all of the data to download before the page is rendered, but rendering in what I perceive as an almost immediate response. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Change the following settings in about:config network.http.pipelining to true network.http.pipelining.maxrequests to something larger, like 30 or 100 network.http.pipelining.ssl to true network.http.proxy.pipelining to true new integer nglayout.initialpaint.delay 100 2. Performance and apparently browser responsiveness is greatly improved Actual Results: Firefox is much more responsive when these settings are used, but slower when they are not used. Expected Results: Firefox is much more responsive when these settings are used</description>

      <title>FF4 App Tab URLs should act more like Bookmarks, and not be current-page persistent across restarts</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0 If you create an App Tab, then follow a link **within** the web page loaded by that App Tab, then close/restart the browser, the App Tab loads with the most recent page opened **within** that App Tab prior to the browser being closed. This is counter-intuitive (especially for web sites that require logins, but don't handle session expirations/login redirects well). App Tabs should behave more like Bookmarks. In other words, the App Tab's URL should be "locked" when defined, and should not be set to the "current" page/URL being displayed within that App Tab when the browser is closed. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open a web site; e.g. http://www.theregister.co.uk/ (the "base" home page). 2. Pin "The Register" as an App Tab. 3. Follow (click on) a link to one of the articles presented on "The Register" home page. 4. Completely close Firefox. 5. Re-open Firefox. Actual Results: Unexpected/Incorrect Result: Firefox displays the article web page, not "The Register" home page. Expected Results: Expected/Correct Result: The App Tab should load "The Register" home page, not the page for the article. This bug may be related to (but does not appear to be the same as) #598587. Perhaps a Preference could be added (either globally, or on a per-App Tab basis, that allows a user to lock App Tab URLs?</description>

To make it more obvious that you can drag a tab in/out of pinned state. 2) "Reload All tabs", reloads a whole group AND the pinned tabs, but not the other groups, so the name is misleading. Should the pinned also be reloaded? This could be a setting. "On reload all tabs, reload also pinned tabs", And maybe rename it to "Reload Tabs in Group" The reason for this idea is that I have grouped a bunch of tabs, with the specific purpose of easy reload, but do not want the pinned reloaded. 3) Why not simply handle the pinned as a special tab group?

      <title>Firefox should optionally display warnings about certificate changes</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0 In the light of recent fraudulent SSL certificates being issued, measures should be taken to increase security of secure transactions for users. One easy and fairly unobtrusive way to do it would be as followed: 1- Firefox stores basic information about certificates of every secure site the user goes to, including the hash, expiration date, CA name and site name. Nothing should change as to what the user sees. 2- When the user goes back to that site, these information are checked. If everything is the same, nothing is shown. 3- If the certificate has changed, a small warning message (see URL example) is shown, with a warning message about what changed, such as "The signing authority has changed." or "The site certificate expired and has been renewed." or "The site name has been modified." The warning would stay until the user clicks somewhere on the page. I believe this would solve most issues where someone may be trying to take advantage of a fraudulent certificate, regardless if they have DNS control (such as a state sponsored attack) or not, without adding too much pain for typical users. The only case that would not be covered with this change would be a first visit, which would require some type of web of trust, and more user interaction on first visits, which is outside the scope of this feature request. Note that this is a feature that should be on by default to be effective, but have a checkbox to turn on or off in the options, or in about:config. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Go to a site that has a fraudulent certificate signed by a valid CA. Actual Results: Nothing. Expected Results: The user should be warned.</description>

Most of the time these capabilities are just abused, but occasionally sites will do something useful with them. Note that such functionality is outside the scope of bug 320522 / NoScript, and I'd imagine that this would be relatively hard to do with an addon (since instead of just deciding whether to load scripts this would have to change JS engine behavior per-site). Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Go to some site where context menu replacement is abused (for instance, a site where if you right-click you get a pop-up saying "HOW DARE YOU TRY TO STEAL MY CONTENT, YOU LITTLE FIEND!!!!"). Decide you'd better disable sites' ability to mess with the context menu, and reload the page. 2. Go to a site like Google Maps where you miss out on functionality if you don't allow JS to replace the context menu. Decide you'd better enable this, and reload the page. 3. Rinse.

You also have to mentally remind your self to switch it back to the default, because if you don't you're just going to confuse your self later. "Huh?! Why has Wikipedia opened instead of Google?! ... Oh, right." I'm not the only one, I've asked other Firefox users and they do the same thing. Worst still, I once did this on my family pc. I got phone call the next day while at work from my Mother asking me why the Internet isn't working? She explained that for reason Google's broken! Seriously. Well that does it.

This could also help to discover this new feature of Firefox. The only disadvantage would be that it is more difficult to close the manager, but this could be solved adding a close button right in the manager. Reproducible: Always</description>

One should be able to darken the hue of the darkest preset red, green, blue etc. as is provided for in IE 9 through Internet Options, Chrome 10 using the 'ChangeColors' extension or Adobe Acrobat Reader Preferences 'Documents Color Options'. This would make using Firefox more amenable for persons sensitive to glare of white background so they can vary the background color from black and still achieve adequate contrast with the chosen text color for their individuated visual perception and comfort. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.open 'Options' --&gt; 'Content' --&gt; 'Colors' 2.click on a color box 3.view palette of take it or leave it choices Actual Results: always the same Expected Results: always the same This is a rare example of Mozilla providing less flexibility and user choice range than competitors such as IE and Chrome. It should be a simple fix since it is so common elsewhere ( even Adobe Acrobat Reader). Print Screen illustrative examples: In IE 9 through 'Internet Options' I can choose a background color and then darken it using the 'Define Custom Color' feature. http://img809.imageshack.us/img809/3805/ie9internetoptionscolor.png In Chrome 10 with the 'ChangeColors' extension I can darken using a slider. http://img710.imageshack.us/img710/2046/chrome10anycolors.png Firefox 4.0 'Options'--&gt;'Content'--&gt;'Colors' continues the Mozilla policy of freezing the color chart to the default choices so I cannot darken the darkest available non-black choices. I have been unable to find an add-on that doesn't require changing the color intensity on individual web pages rather than systemically. http://img860.imageshack.us/img860/4522/firefox40optionscontent.png No Squint add on apparently has the same limitation as the built in Firefox color chart. http://img811.imageshack.us/img811/2258/nosquint.png In addition to the other major browsers Adobe Acrobat Reader also has a color slider. http://img3.imageshack.us/img3/4297/acrobatreaderc.png</description>

Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Find some large file(s) to download. 2. Select and begin downloading 3. Try to find a count or progress status outside of the task bar indicator. Actual Results: Progress is vaguely displayed in the taskbar entry (in Windows 7, not sure about Vista) for Firefox 4. There's really no way to indicate how many downloads are currently transferring or an ETA given for any downloads. Expected Results: The downloads button could behave in a similar fashion to how the current stop/reload buttons behave when placed in the tool bar. With a small animation (loading or otherwise) to indicate a transfer is in progress. A small numerical indicator could also be added as an overlay to the number of downloads in progress. Other thoughts would be to also display a tooltip when hovering the downloads button which quickly lists the number of active transfers with a complete ETA. Alternately (in Windows 7) a jump menu shortcut for the Firefox entry could be added when a file is being transferred to open the downloads window.</description>

One thing that has been annoying me since testing Firefox4 beta's and then using the release is that when one starts it up in windows, after double clicking on it's icon on the desktop, it launches but one does not know that it is launching until the main frame window is displayed 30 to 40 seconds later. Thus, I click on the app icon several times not knowing if I double clicked on it properly, or if it even started with the first double click, then I have several instances of the app up a minute later. What I suggest would be a splash window or something similar displayed right after start-up showing the user that the app has indeed started and is currently initializing. If one examines the M$ Outlook 2010 splash window, it even tells you what exactly it's initializing in a static text box IE: (Plug-In *PlugInName* 1 of 15 or such). I do not recall if Firefox under my Ubuntu 10.10 does the same thing but it probably does. Thanks again for the great browser, I changed to it from IE8 three to four months ago and it's the best thing that I did.

      <title>Add support for multiple session restore from History menu</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0 Serious data loss issues exist in Firefox 4.0, both for people who haven't discovered the undocumented on-demand session restore - Bug 636777 - and those who have - Bug 637148, Bug 636716. The severity of these and other related bugs could be greatly reduced by adding a basic form of multiple session restore, for instance by turning 'Restore Previous Session' on the History menu into a parent menu. Example submenu items would be as follows: Session 1 (1 Window, 1 Tab, 1 Group) Session 2 (2 Windows, 53 Tabs, 2 Groups) So if, in the example above, Session 1 was the instance of about:home from Bug 637148, the user could easily locate their main session, Session 2. (The button on about:home would always restore Session 1.) The menu would hold the last 5 or so sessions. (Each session is just a small database of windows, tabs, tab order, favicons, etc, so has a small filesize.) It would certainly be desirable to also have a way to delete individual sessions, but the primary issue here is of widespread data loss - potentially for tens of millions of users. The solution here would alter that to data misplacement. Note that selecting Session 2 in the above example would make it Session 1 - in other words, no sessions would be lost just by looking for the relevant session. Exiting at this point would retain it as Session 1. (By naming the session files sessionstore1.js, sessionstore2.js, etc, advanced users could delete an unwanted session with the browser closed; if sessionstore1.js was not found by Firefox on restart it would rename sessionstore2.js to 1 and so on.) Bug 645554 suggests a way to opt out of a session restore on startup. What would probably be more useful would be a way to escape from a session load already in progress, for instance by pressing the Escape key. Tabs that were yet to partially load would be automatically closed, and partially loaded ones would be stopped from loading further. Therefore, if the user had a couple of 10-tab sessions on the History menu they could quickly determine the important one, by halting it if wrong. (Again, note that halting doesn't delete it; it would be retained as Session 1 - the most recently accessed.) Multiple session support actually already exists in the program: It's possible to have nested instances of the about:sessionrestore tab saved, and these work correctly. But while that sort of graphic user interface - which shows individual tab names with favicons - would be desirable, a basic submenu as above would be sufficient to avoid data loss in most cases. Fancier solutions could be developed later. But it's critically important to have some sort of solution _built into the browser_ (not in the form of an add-on) asap. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. See relevant bugs. Actual Results: Session is lost Expected Results: Session is located</description>

That is becasue the forward/back buttons are at the left. This avoids unnecessary mouse movements. The decision to have to tab titles above the "bookmark bar" (I don't know the exact phrase) is poor, because when the mouse is inside the content window and you want to switch tabs, you'll have to cross the "bookmarks bar" to reach the tab titles. That is confusing and leads to mistakes (mixing existing tabs with bookmarks). The design of Firefox 3.x was much better there. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open some tabs 2. Navigate/use those Actual Results: You are moving the mouse (your eyes) more than necessary Expected Results: Regquired mouse (eye) movements should be minimal Don't do what others do; do the best instead.</description>

At the moment they are sorted completely arbitrarily, which is confusing. They're not sorted by name, url, date added, last visited or anything! Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Tag a bunch of bookmarks with the same tag 2. Put tag on bookmarks toolbar, or just go into places library and select that tag Actual Results: Items not ordered in any sensible way! Reordering them in the places library does not sort them permanently - the way they are sorted in the drop down menu on the bookmarks toolbar is unchanged. Also, drag and drop duplicates the tag rather than reordering them. Expected Results: Items should be sorted in a sensible way by default, e.g. alphabetically. It should be possible to rearrange them by dragging and dropping. Reordering them in the places library should permanently sort them so that they appear in that order on the bookmarks toolbar drop down. This is with FF4, I don't know if it happened with FF3, I didn't use tags much back then.</description>

Not in the technical sence, but it's like a DoS for the user. Reproducer: - go to the preferences dialog. In the privacy tab, enable "accept coocies" and set the "keep until" dropdown to "always ask" [wording might differ, I'm using the german version] - open http://www.derwesten.de [ If you want to exacerbate someone, send him the above reproducer without the following text ;-) ] Opening the page sends 75 cookies at once (!). Combined with the setting to ask for confirmation for every cookie, Firefox opens 75 dialogs asking if I want to accept the cookie. Having to click 75 times is very annoying, I decided to use xkill instead. Unfortunately "remote-kill webmaster@derwesten.de" didn't work ;-)) Better solutions for the cookie dialog would be: a) "collect" all cookie requests and combine them to one dialog: "www.derwesten.de wants to set 75 cookies. Accept?" b) delay the dialog for the second...75th cookie until the user has decided what to do with the first one. If the user sets a default for the domain after clicking away 5 cookies, the remaining 70 cookies are handled with this behaviour instead of displaying 70 more dialogs.

      <title>Expose tabs on-demand preference</title>
      <description>I'd like us to expose the on-demand tab loading (currently done via the browser.sessionstore.max_concurrent_tabs=0 preference) in the prefs under session restore. It would look like this when selected: When Firefox starts: [Show my windows and tabs from last time ▼] [✓] restore tabs on-demand If we can't resize the window to accommodate this extra line that only shows when restoring tabs is selected, it's OK to leave a blank line here for the other options. It should be unchecked by default, so the current behavior doesn't change unless you opt in to it. Some additional notes: 1. I'm sure the wording can be improved, suggestions welcome. 2. Based on discussions, we probably want to add a "restore tabs on demand" preference that short-circuits the session restore concurrency setting instead of overwriting the number with 0. 3. There might be a better place or way to expose this setting, suggestions welcome. Wanted to get a bug in, so Paul can take a look if we want to try landing this for the upcoming release — since the code is already in Firefox 4.</description>

Now compare this to the behaviour for popups blocking: * Enable popup blocking * Access a webpage that needs a popup to work * User will get notified by a small yellow bar that the website is trying to open a popup Basically without a similar UI, whitelisting cookies is not usable, as it is impossib^^very difficult to guess what domain the website is trying to set a cookie for.

Still, access to it is rather complicated. I would like to propose the introduction of "about:userchrome" as an easy way to edit this file.

      <title>about:home search engine (Google) logo should link to google.com</title>
      <description>The about:home search box shows the logo of the search engine used on the left. Unfortunately it's not a link, so if you want to use more advanced features of said search engine, you have to enter the URL manually. How about linking the Google (or whatever it is, per locale) logo to that search engine's homepage. FWIW, the Canonical guys do that on their Ubuntu Firefox homepage, too. CCing lforrest who I think is in charge of about:home, and faaborg for UX input. Thanks!</description>

I can do all this (clicking the links, scrolling the new page) using the mouse without having to move it much... except for closing the tab. I either have to close the tab using the keyboard shortcut, or move the mouse out of the content area and use the Close button on the tab itself, which means the mouse is then out of position for going to the next link. I just thought it might be useful to provide a Close tab option on the context menu as well. Reproducible: Always</description>

Vertical pixels are now rare, and there are horizontal ones to spare. and yet I am loosing vertical height to window border, menu, address bar, toolbar, tabs, and status line. Oh, and the search box if I use ^F. I know the very latest browsers have saved a bit of space by re-arranging menus &amp; tabs, but I would go further. I'd like to see the status line moveable to one vertical edge, and some or all of the things along the top similarly shiftable., to the same or to the other vertical edge. And the search box could hover transparently and dragably over the page, getting less transparent when the cursor is over it. This could get me 25% bigger video windows, or readable text.

Instead of this behavior, a new tab empty tab should be opened and the tab group should not change. This makes sense especially if you use tab groups to keep things separate (e.g. per task). In that case, you don't want to continue browsing using a tabs group for a different task without noticing. It would also make it consistent with what happens when closing the last tab in a window (I have "browser.tabs.closeWindowWithLastTab=false"). Also take care that the new tab should be created exactly like when you would press Ctrl+T - see bug 648286 for more info. Reproducible: Always</description>

I tend to use a group for procrastination stuff and another one for work. The problem is that in my procrastination group it's really useful to have facebook, gmail, google reader and twitter as app tabs; but it's really distracting to have them in the work group, as they are most the time blinking, and that leads me to procrastination again. So I think it would be a great feature to be able to choose whether app tabs should be shown in a group or not. Reproducible: Always Expected Results: The possibility to hide app tabs.</description>

      <title>Allow staging all test files without generating a tests.zip file</title>
      <description>For RPMs, I am generating a tests rpm that contains all the tests. Because the package-tests target depends on each test suite's stage target, it is the safest target to run in the RPM packaging to make sure that all tests get staged properly. Instead, I would like to call a 'stage-all-suites' target (name tbd) that depends on all test suites being staged and is depended on by package-tests. A non-ideal solution would be to have something like ifndef DONT_MAKE_TESTS_ZIP zip -r9D .... endif Right now, these tests rpms aren't able to run the unit tests, but that is something that I plan on fixing.</description>

Example, I search on Google for a band, read a few pages about them, then decide I want to look up a related band on Wikipedia. I change the drop down to Wikipedia search and put in the band name. Then, on the Wikipedia page, I read about a band member I want to Google. Here's the thing. I select the name, and right click, and it's still set to search Wikipedia, even though, nine times out of ten, I'll want to use the default Google search, so I have to change it. This applies if I'd pasted his name into the search box too. Can it be made that you choose which search types are "springy", and they bounce back to your default or what you had before after one use? Hope you like this idea and see the problem I'm on about. Thanks! Reproducible: Always</description>

To return to the page, you have to click the Back button and then the page loads again (the "Connecting...", "Waiting...", and other processes repeat). Most of the time, the users would want to stay on the page while wishing to have a glimpse of the full background image. It's desirable to open the background image in a new tab/window while keeping the original webpage open, or at least an option can be provided. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open a webpage with a background image, say, Firefox's Twitter profile at "http://twitter.com/firefox". 2. Right click on the page and choose "View Background Image". Actual Results: The profile page is replaced with the image. You need to load the page again by clicking the Back button. Expected Results: The image should open in a new tab, some people prefer that.</description>

      <title>Automatic ordering of bookmarks cannot be saved</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0 When managing bookmarks there's no way of ordering by name, date or anything _and_ saving the order. (translating from Swedish version here) All I can do is 'view' and choosing either 'unordered' or 'order by [...]'. When using the automatic 'order by', I can't modify or save the order so that the menu later on is correct. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Go to the bookmark manager 2. Choose a folder with bookmarks 3. Go to the menu and choose 'Order by name' 4. Stare at the screen, trying to figure out how to save the automatically ordered list. Actual Results: I still had my _manually_ ordered list in the bookmark menu. Expected Results: The list should have been automatically ordered and stored for easy, logical access in the bookmark menu. Either a 'permanently order by' menu option, or a 'save' button somewhere would suffice.</description>

      <title>Add "Disable Cache" toolbox button</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:6.0a1) Gecko/20110421 Firefox/6.0a1 Build Identifier: 6.0a1 (2011-04-21) This is an enhancement request. Safari has a "Disable Caches" menu option (under the top-level Develop menu). When loading a page, it causes that page and all its resources to be fetched over the network rather than served from the browser cache. It would be great if Firefox provided a similar option, under the Tools top-level menu, with an associated keyboard shortcut. Being able to quickly and easily toggle disable/enable of the cache is enormously useful when doing page/site troubleshooting, and having the option be more easily discoverable in Firefox by Web-developers users would make Firefox a more attractive site-development and troubleshooting tool for them.

      <title>New tab button should not move from under mouse.</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:5.0a2) Gecko/20110421 Firefox/5.0a2 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:5.0a2) Gecko/20110421 Firefox/5.0a2 When opening new tabs with the new tab button, the button should not move away from under the mouse until the mouse has moved away, signifying the new tab button is no longer wanted. One possible solution could be that the new tab button stays in place, while the new tabs open to the left. This would be much like the behavior when the tab bar is full. Obviously these possible solutions could adversely affect users. It may be most other users do not open multiple tabs like this and it's just me, and the behavior now is the most efficient for most users. Another possible solution could be a permanent re-homing of the button to the far right hand side of the tab bar. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Start with the tab bar mostly empty. 2. Open a new tab with the New Tab button. 3. Open another new tab. 4. Open another new tab. 5. Notice the annoyance of constantly re-aiming the cursor to the button. Actual Results: Annoyance of constantly re-aiming the cursor to the button. Expected Results: Multiple tabs should be opened without the moving of the mouse button.</description>

This is extremely useful nowadays with all the problems one can encounter when accessing the internet from an unsecured network. While Firefox had not supported this so far, I was able to use the feature thanks to an add-on called firemole. However, the add-on is no longer maintained. This request had been brought up in the past but I'm afraid it might have been forgotten. See bug 209312 and bug 378637. I'm creating a new request because I believe those were different times and now this feature would be extremely useful, increasing Firefox security options. Furthermore, since the mentioned add-on was working up to Firefox 3.6 it shouldn't be difficult to implement. I appreciate your help on this regard. Reproducible: Always</description>

      <title>Should fallback to search in case of DNS lookup error</title>

Firefox was one of the first browsers to introduce the revolutionary paradigm of "Location bar": now users are not required to know/remember the exact page address, they can enter search phrase and get to the desired site! Google and Firefox really changed the way people use the Web nowadays. However, currently one cannot reliably use search phrase containing "." (dot). For example, if I enter ".net", I get rather unhelpful message: Firefox cannot find server www..net. However, if I use Google search, I immediately get what I expect in the first link: a page describing Microsoft .NET (http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework). I propose that in such a case Firefox falls back to search engine method instead of reporting error. It should happen only once to prevent infinite loop in case of offline site. I believe search queries containing "." are rather common for some categories of people, i.e. for programmers as "." is a special symbol in many programming languages. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Enter ".net" in Location bar 2. Press "Enter" Actual Results: Unhelpful error message Firefox cannot find server www..net. Expected Results: Load page http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework -or- show search results on ".net"</description>

I really like the way that Opera does it, by default, without asking, always reloading your session after restart. I think it should be considered a bug that there is no 'always do this' option for restoring a session. It seems anti Firefox-fu. If you want to make it optional whether or not to restore session on restart and put a button on a new-tab-kinda-webpage-kinda-browser-tool-page (which is rather odd), then there should be a checkbox or some other easily accessible button that lets you do it. If you are going to put browser-controlling functionality in a web page, I vote to make it more verbose than less. (I would also prefer that restore session automatically is default behavior, for what it's worth) Reproducible: Always</description>

Google Chrome allows users the ability to select between a GTK+ theme and the MS-Windows "Classic" theme for Chrome installations. Opera displays the same icons and theme for both Linux and Windows installations. Why can't Linux Firefox users get the same icons as MS-Windows users get to use? Firefox needs to offer a setting that will allow users to pick either the GTK+ theme or the Firefox theme that is displayed in MS-Windows. Reproducible: Always Expected Results: A setting should exist like Google Chrome has where users can select for display in Linux the same theme that is default in Windows installations.

This means: - no display of the blue SSL site-assurance bar - no display of the green EV bar (obvious, but listing it anyway) - no display of any change in authentication level - A warning for every form POST to that server, with the following wording: "The information you have entered is to be sent over an encrypted connection, but it is possible for it to be intercepted and read by a third party. This is most potentially dangerous when connecting through public wifi hotspots or other untrusted networks. If you have previously seen a blue or green badge in the address bar and do not see it now, YOUR INFORMATION IS BEING INTERCEPTED, and YOU SHOULD NOT CONTINUE! Are you sure you want to continue sending this information?" I recommend making this a mandatory warning for all UI submissions via https to servers with untrusted certificate chains. The user should be able to import self-certificates for known sites and have the UI forcibly inform them when the credential has changed, with wording similar to the above, and possibly with a red badge.

Major issue is that when the list of feed items in the drop down is longer than the page, it scrolls. This is great, but the last two options "Open ____" &amp; "Open all in Tabs" gets hidden at the bottom of the list. It would be great if they always stayed visible &amp; the feed items scrolled between the bottom 2 items (which would always be visible, and the top. The second thing I think would be helpful, is if the original icons could somehow be preserved &amp; a Feed icon placed over top, or in the corner of the feed logo. I switched a lot of my bookmarks over to feed bookmarks, but often just like going to the site, being able to find the icon quickly (by the favicon) &amp; being to jump into the site quickly are a priority. Third Suggestion. The feeds only update so often. Its too slow for quickly changing content. Would it be possible to specify how often they are updated, or even better, if it has not been updated when one uses the drop down (by hovering over, or even clicking the feed (to produce the drop down) Perhaps it could produce and event to re-check the feed, to see new items. I know it might be a bit of a nightmare in terms of what it does to a feed already loaded, but I could certainly live with items moving around some if it was going to provide me with up to date information. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: Feature Request Expected Results: To Recap. 1. Drop Down Bar On Feed Icons Scroll between the last &lt;HR&gt; so that "Open" never dissimilar on long feed lists. 2. Favicon has rss icon superimposed rather than replaced with rss icon. 3. Hovering over the bookmark feed, or clicking on it creates an event to re-check the feed for new items.</description>

However, when I type "google" in the AwesomeBar later, there are two items at the top of the dropdown: one for www.google.com (which shows the Google favicon next to it) and the next one below it for google.com (which doesn't show the Google favicon next to it, and doesn't contain the www in the URL). Not sure if this is even possible or would cause any issues, but I think it would make the drop down list cleaner if those domain.com URLs that are simply immediately redirected to www.domain.com could be hidden from the AwesomeBar drop down. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Go to a website that redirects you to www.domain.com, such as mozilla.org, google.com, etc. 2. Close the tab, open a new one, and start typing the URL again (such as "goog"). 3. Note there are at least two drop down items for the URL you visited: one being www.google.com, another below it being google.com.</description>

      <title>Channel switcher shouldn't be hidden behind a "Change" link</title>
      <description>When trying to switch to another channel, a user has to read a lot of text to discover how to switch. I think a lot of people trying to switch open the About dialog and close it because they don't find the switch buttons. Instead of hiding those options, we should display the &lt;select&gt; options by default. It will allow people to quickly scan for that.</description>

      <title>iQ library should be separated into a reusable code module</title>
      <description>I recently read Ian's post on what was learned while developing Panorama (http://blog.iangilman.com/2011/04/firefox-panorama-what-did-we-learn.html), and I was reminded about the iQ library, which is something I discussed with Aza at some point. I was very excited about it because many Firefox extensions use jQuery, and it would be really awesome if we included jQuery support in Firefox to some extent so that extension authors don't need to worry about including the library themselves. So I looked into the code and was finally disappointed when I realized that the whole code for iq.js is just being merged into the tabview.js file, which contains a ton of other globals and code. It would be very useful to have iq as a separate JSM, so that authors can import it into their code and have lightweight jQuery capabilities without having to include any more library code.</description>

Moreover there are many hidden files such as, in Linux, the very important .thunderbird containing the mails of a user of Thunderbird, and .mozilla, containing his bookmarks. I don't mind very much where automatically created technical files are stored, but, as far as files for humans are concerned, I don't like at all the idea of having in one place all the the mails, in an other place all the bookmarks, in a 3rd place all the remaining information I need etc.. This reminds me the 19th century books main classification in libraries: high books, medium-sized books, small books. The topic classification was only a secondary criteria (inside the "high books", all high books of maths were together, but small books of maths were elsewhere). In modern libraries, such a technical classification has been replaced by a more functional one, so that all books of algebra are together, whatever be their size. The same way, I don't like having similar parallel hierarchies in my documents, in my e-mails, my bookmarks etc. I'd like to have in a one directory called providers/graphists/Naranbolor/ all the files concerning the graphist called Naranbolor, whether these are pictures, bills, tariff spreadsheets, quotations documents, e-mails or the bookmark to her website, rather than a folder in Thunderbird for her mails, a bookmark called "Naranbolor" in a folder providers/graphists in Firefox, and a third folder Documents/ providers/graphists/Naranbolor/ in my file hierarchy. The same way LibreOffice opens when I double-click on an ODF document, Inkscape opens when I double-click on a SVG document, gedit opens when I double-click a text document etc., Firefox would open when I click on a bookmark. I think giving priority to functional classification on technical one would be a major improvement in personal computer software design, including in cloud design. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.Get the need to classify functionally your information. 2.You have to create similar folders in your bookmarks manager, your file system, your email manager. Actual Results: After you've done this job, you still cannot see together in one place the mails, the bookmarks and the other files regarding a given topic. Expected Results: Getting in one folder (whether a technical folder or a virtual one does matter) all the information concerning any given topic, including bookmarks, no matter the form of the information.</description>

I, almost daily save All my tabs, as I update my nightly builds on 7 systems everyday and usually want to get back to where I was. I almost never, if ever "reload all tabs",, Often I reload the one I'm on, but never all.. They should be completely separate as they look so similar when going fast as I do. At the Very Least there should be a hr (separator) between them. That's it. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Right Click any Tab 2. 3. Actual Results: I hit "reload all tabs" by mistake Too Often. Expected Results: the "bookmark all tabs" save dialog should come up. I don't mind the BM all tabs not being in the Bookmarks menu, If you will make this change.. Waiting for 20 tabs to 'reload' sucks. The "reload all tabs" should not be directly on top of "bookmark all tabs". I bm all tabs daily as I use all 'nightly builds' on my 7 systems at home.</description>

      <title>Provide "restart with clean profile" beside "restart in safe mode"</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0.1 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0.1 In the help menu of fx4 there's the new restart in safe mode command. To troubleshoot problems/bugs, it may make sense to provide also a "restart with clean profile" command, that would restart firefox on a new, empty profile. At shutdown, either the old profile should be silently swapped back in or a popup should come up asking if the user wants to keep the new profile or if it wants to revert to the old one.

      <title>Scratchpad context selection should conform to DOM Inspector context selection</title>
      <description>DOM Inspector has "Inspect Chrome Document" and "Inspect Content Document" File menus which allow users to select exactly which context should be used. I'd like to see Workspace/Scratchpad conform. We'd have to make two changes afaict: 1. Remove the "Context" menu 2. Rename the menuitems to say "Scratch Chrome Document" or "Use Chrome Document" 3. Provide menupopups for each menuitem which make it possible to select exactly which chrome/content document that the user wants to use.</description>

      <title>Awesomebar should search open tabs first.</title>
      <description>Awesomebar can at times be slow, especially with lots of history. If I search for a phrase in the awesomebar, it can come up with suggestions, before mentioning that there is an open tab that matches. Open tabs should be searched first - rather than popping up somewhat randomly in the list during the period of a several second search.</description>

Assigning keyword edit to doubleclick would be handy, as this mouse action currently has no function and doubleclick seems quite intuitive for this. 2) It would be great to add possibility to export/import search engines to/from a file including their order and keyword. Currently, I can copy all SE XML files, but then I lose both their order and the keywords, or copy the whole prefs.js file, which then clutters my profile with unneeded settings… Reproducible: Always</description>

This is fine, but when the status bar, now called the "Add-on bar" is shown, there is a vast quantity of wasted space at the left side, which could be used to show hovered link URLs in, as it did in Firefox 3.6-. The whole objective of removing the status bar was to reduce the browser's UI footprint, was it not? When it's showing anyway, using this wasted space will reduce its UI footprint further. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open the Add-on Bar 2. Move the mouse over a link. Actual Results: A URL popup is shown just above the Add-on Bar. Expected Results: The URL should be displayed inside the Add-on Bar.</description>

I know that there are x ways to open bookmarks in a new tab: - middle mouse button (I have a laptop) - ctrl-click (I have always to push two buttons and use two hands to open a bookmark?) - context-menu (Thanks, right-click, find the open in new tab, left click, it's a good training for the touch pad, something easier?) - tabmixplus (nice I have to install an add-on with 100 unneeded features to just open bookmarks in a new tab?) I'm not alone, just google firefox open bookmarks in a new tab and you will see that is a common request. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. open the bookmarks menu 2. click any bookmarks 3.

      <title>When using a search engine keyword, UI should indicate a keyword is being used, like Chrome</title>
      <description>Steps to reproduce: 1. Set up a search engine keyword, e.g., "w" for Wikipedia. 2. Type "w foo" in the location bar (don't hit Enter). Firefox 4.0 behavior: Location bar reads "w foo". No visual indication is given that hitting Enter will actually search Wikipedia instead of behaving like for any other search term. Chrome 13 dev behavior: As soon as you type "w ", it disappears. The left part of the search box becomes a gray box that says "Search en.wikipedia.org:", and the rest is empty, with the cursor at the beginning. Hitting backspace returns to the normal search box, with just "w" in it, same as Firefox. This is a nice touch that makes Chrome's search keywords implementation slightly less mysterious than Firefox's.</description>

      <title>If I type an address without a protocol, assume I want https if I usually visit with https</title>
      <description>Steps to reproduce: 1. Launch Firefox with a profile that has visited https://www.bankofamerica.com/ in the past. 2. Type www.bankofamerica.com. 3. Press Enter. Result: Firefox guesses that I want http. Expected: Firefox should guess that I want https. You can think of this idea as HSTS-lite. It doesn't prevent me from visiting with http, so it's safe to infer. I want Firefox to guess the faster and more secure option when I don't specify a protocol. Trickier cases: * Typing 'bankofamerica.com', without the 'www'. * Sites that are frequently visited both with and without https.</description>

For example if I visited site and wanted to allow storing cookies I would not need to go to preferences menu, search (or add) site (to do it I must copy address from an address bar) and such feature may save time by skipping unnecessary actions. What I mean is tab context menu item that opens about:permissions and highlight site I just visited or add it with default permissions if it is not in the list. I know there's option in right click → "Page Information" but I think the way I suggested is more convenient because page information is in one place and page settings in another and new GUI looks better for it.

It would be nice to switch faster. If I could have quick access to the names of my tab groups, this would be helpful. Idea: Add the tab group (names) to the tab pulldown in the tab bar. In my opinion, this could be on the first (top) positions of this pulldown, followed by the panorama item and then the tabs (I mean most of the time, I habe a one klick way to go to the tab of my choice, whatfor the pulldown anyway). Alternative idea 1: Add a pull down possibility to the Panorama Icon in the tab bar. List the tab groups there for faster selection. Alternative idea 2: Let there appear a pseudotab per tag group in the tab bar which actually switch to the last seen tab of the specified tab group. Pseudotabs should look different (by colour, stile or border) for easy spotting. Even an "app tab group" (pinned on the left hand side) could make sense in this setting.

In the current state of FF4 (with the option ui.use_activity_cursor turned on ), when I hover over a link, click it and stay there, the hover cursor remains, which is irritating to some people including me (see discussion at https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=482985), i.e. it should change into the activity cursor all the time until the new page is loaded. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Hover link 2. Click 3. Stay there Actual Results: No busy/activity cursor Expected Results: Cursor turns to activity cursor</description>

Whem mouse moves over toolbar or tabs pointer becomes normal state and vice versa. I think his is right behaiviour and Firefox should do the same. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Set ui.use_activity_cursor to true in about:config 2. Start loading any page 3. Move cursor over toolbar or tabl or menu or addon bar Actual Results: Firefox shows "busy" indicator Expected Results: Cursor should change to default When page still loading and when cursor moves over page content again - cursor should become "busy" state again</description>

      <title>can't choose saved username and password to insert in popup query</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:2.0.1) Gecko/20110429 Firefox/4.0.1 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:2.0.1) Gecko/20110429 Firefox/4.0.1 I have two different pairs of username and password saved for a page where the beginning of the URL is the same. The ending of the URL just alters a little, so these two pairs are valid for both popups where I need to insert them. Username and password are different! Automatically the first pair is inserted into the popup query and if I try to select the other username (through typing the beginning of it) no menu is opened where I can choose it, so the other password + username is inserted. I also tried to type the whole username and then change the textfield, but that also doesn't work. The two sites are: http://www.iaas.uni-stuttgart.de/lehre/vorlesung/aktuell/vorlesungen/modell/uebungen/ http://www.iaas.uni-stuttgart.de/lehre/vorlesung/aktuell/vorlesungen/modell/ I don't know if they can be reached from outside the network. So sorry if they can't. I didn't find a real workaround except looking into the passwordmanager for the username and password and retype them into the popup query. But in my opinion that doesn't count. It's different from this Bug: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=444333 Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Save two passwords on the same site where the query is a popup. 2. Open the query and you won't be able to get the second password entered inserted. Expected Results: Give a menu to choose which pair of username and password should be used.</description>

      <title>UI - Why is it getting smaller?</title>

The recent changes from FF 3.6 to 4.0 have prompted numerous calls from friends and family on how to downgrade or restore previous UI elements. It has also caused me to disable significant functionality in Firefox 3+ and not upgrade to 4.0. Rather than provide a laundry list of pros and cons, which never works no matter how well a point is argued, I would instead ask a simple question: What user experience is being added by increasing screen area and removing UI elements that Fullscreen does not already provide? I ask as all sorts of changes are being made for the benefit of netbook users and in the interest of companies who want more space to advertise but ease of use issues for average users seem to be ignored in the current (FF4) and planned (URL bar removal) UI changes.

      <description>In about:permissions when "All sites" is highlighted in the list, the buttons say "Clear all cookies" and "Manage Cookies". The first button does the same function as the "Remove all cookies" button does in the Cookies dialog that appears when you click "Manage Cookies". We should avoid a "scared of the unknown" user experience of needing to ask what the difference is between "Clearing" and "Removing" all cookies when there is no difference. Consistent wording would also be better for localization teams.</description>

      <title>Document the use of file:// URL's with the firefox command and possibly remote instance</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9.1.19) Gecko/20110430 Iceweasel/3.5.19 (like Firefox/3.5.19) Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9.1.19) Gecko/20110430 Iceweasel/3.5.19 (like Firefox/3.5.19) This is a followup of bug 346198. "./firefox --help" (from a recent nightly) says: Usage: ./firefox-bin [ options ... ] [URL] with nothing else special about the URL. The help text should say how file:// URL's are handled when firefox connects to an instance running on a remote machine. The problem is that the file hierarchy on the remote machine is different. This can be either just missing documentation or a real bug in the behavior. For instance, should file:/// (local) URL's should be rewritten to a file://remote_host/ form (possibly unsupported, but at least the URL would be more correct and wouldn't make a wrong file to be opened).

      <title>Split -no-remote option into -no-local and -no-remote options</title>

The firefox command currently has the following option: -no-remote Open new instance, not a new window in running instance. (which is a bit ambiguous because it doesn't say where the running instance can be found, and how profiles have an effect on it). However the user may want something more flexible: connect to a running instance only when it is on the local machine. The reason is to be able to use the file:/// URL's or other features (e.g. IP-based permissions and/or proxy settings may be different on the remote machine). IMHO, the -no-remote option should do that. And there should be a new -no-local option that has the current -no-remote behavior. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. n/a</description>

If you ask me, this is very confusing and not clean. Here is what everything should be. Option: Downloads if you click on a link while holding down or push return in the address bar while holding down, regardless of the content (html, jpg, swf). Command (control on windows): Makes a new tab with the link when you click a link while holding down, same thing for the address bar. There we go, now it's clean and standardized.

      <description>Web Console has an error message: --- An unbalanced tree was written using document.write() causing data from the network to be reparsed. For more information https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Optimizing_Your_Pages_for_Speculative_Parsing @ &lt;URL&gt; --- The link to developer.mozilla.org can be neither followed, nor copied directly. You can only type it down, or copy the whole message and remove stuff on the left and on the right side. The page URL can be long, and the error message itself is not very short, so that is not very convenient. There should probably be a way to follow the link, or to copy the link without the rest of the message.</description>

It is only present on the homepage and therefore does not take up vertical space when browsing the web. the Bookmark Bar allows the user to add individual bookmarks or folders that dropdown to display contents when opened. I'd love to see a Startpage/Homepage like this for Firefox users. Basically the same thing that Firefox currently offers with the "Show a blank page" setting. Except, the blank page would display a "Chrome-Style" bookmark bar. This way users would be presented the bar upon starting the browser. And when browsing the web by clicking the HOME button could return to this window from which to select bookmarks. An additional option might be to present several Bookmark Bars on the page, not just one. They could run the length of the window. Different bars could be used to help categorize bookmarks based on Tag etc. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: I'd like to see the following options available: 1.Preferences &gt; General &gt; Startup &gt; When Firefox Starts = BOOKMARK-HOMEPAGE 2.Preferences &gt; General &gt; Startup &gt; Home Page = BOOKMARK-HOMEPAGE Actual Results: feature request Expected Results: feature request [IMG]http://i.imgur.com/ow64n.png[/IMG]</description>

Expected Results: It is possible to scroll search engines also without pressing the Accel key for the mouse only interaction. I think that this option could be a good default for switching faster between search engines, but I will understand if the current behaviour will remain the default. I think that an option in the about:config could be a good solution. I don't think that don't pressing a key will accidentally trigger the event and confuse the user, because he can do this only when hovering on the search bar: currenlty the user does not have any other intention when scrolling on the search bar and no other behaviour by the bar is expected other than scrolling between search engines.</description>

      <title>TB Revisions since v3.5, in v 4.0 Giant Leaps backward</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0.1 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0.1 1. I have already discussed deletion of Close Tabs function deleted from File Pulldown Menu, deleting an important capability. 2. Also deleted was Bookmark Pulldown Menu Listing called "Manage Bookmarks" which was a very useful function which opened a separate page where the bookmark entries could be organized into folders, etc in a passive environment. 3. This has been deleted, and now there is just the bookmark pulldown list comprising both bookmarks, and subfolders which can be added to the list and named. But it is very difficult to drag bookmarks into these sub folders, without some other bookmark on the way being unintentionally selected. When that happens of course the corresponding page opens, closing the bookmark pulldown, and leaving the bookmark that was being dragged. back in its original place. 4. Also, when selecting a folder entry in Bookmarks, it is not then possible to select a subfolder by eg r-click - you can only open a single level, and then open the sub-folder. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.Bookmark list to long. 2.Add (sub)folder in bookmark list to reduce length of list. 3. Try to drag bookmarks into subfolder. 4. In the process, unintentionally select bookmark being dragged over. 5. Corresponding (unwanted page opens) aborting process of Bookmark management. Actual Results: Can't organize bookmarks into efficient tree. Expected Results: Expect Firefox to work like v 3.5. Make v 3.5 available for those who don't appreciate "efficiencies" made by deleting important functions like "Close Tab" and "Manage Bookmarks", etc. Enhance Firefox by restoring deleted functions, eg by reverting to superior previous version.</description>

Or, it could be set up just to ask if you want PB. You could argue that having a list of private sites would defeat the purpose of private browsing, since somebody else could access the list. But it would at least prevent someone from accidentally stumbling on the history for that domain. They would have to be deliberately trying to snoop. Reproducible: Always</description>

      <description>As apostrophes can't exist with in domain names I'm suggesting that Firefox should automatically either ignore them or automatically remove them, this would help those people who add the apostrophe to the URL because it is a company that has an apostrophe in its name but not in their web address as that's not possible, if something can't exist in a domain name then FF should just ignore it, at least in this case. Obviously they can exist later in addresses, but this bug is specifically for the domain part of the address only. www.mcdonald's.com</description>

      <title>Implement a comprehensive way to show link targets in the location bar</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:5.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:5.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0 This is a request to get a feature akin bug 587908 right. == Explanation: Above mentioned bug was about levering the location bar by moving the information about the targets of hovered links from the (then) to-be-removed status bar to it. As far as I understand, bug 541656 was instead implemented in the final Firefox 4, because some critical features weren’t implemented into the link target display in the location bar in time. I know of no other shortcomings that the chrome-like pop-up doesn’t share (e.g. that both can display a shorter part of a long URL than the status bar could) Please elaborate further problems that have to be addressed before reintroducing the link target display in the location bar. == Implementation The implementation was removed from (I think) Firefox 4 Beta 12, and externalized into the add-on https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/link-location-bar/ Up next, my ideas on a possible implementation: 1. The truncating/shortness of the URL: This is a hard one, since the user has to see part of the current URL to understand that the arrow means “if you click, this URL changes to that URL” Maybe we can start with the right half, and then slowly and unobtrusively extend the width of the link target, until it covers the full location bar. we should also make URL and link location visually different (e.g. lighter colour to indicate that it isn’t the current status) 2. No location bar in full-screen mode: This is easier, and I can think of multiple solutions: • Show the navigation toolbar I don’t really like this one. The navigation toolbar is a clunky piece and contains many buttons, bells and whistles that can’t be clicked when the toolbar is shown on link hover. • Show the location bar alone, at the very top of the screen …or a bar that looks like it. This would be the same as the current implementation, but looking like the location bar, and only present in fullscreen mode. The shortness-problem can be avoided by making it full-width unless the mouse cursor would be in the area it covers, in which case it would span the half of the screen on which the cursor isn’t (see attachment) == Note As Dave Garrett pointed out in bug 541656, comment 113, I should file a new bug, since bug 587908 was invalidated by bug 541656, and these closed bugs are no place to discuss a new/extended reintroduction of a scrapped feature.

      <title>[idea] Certificate abuse with root CA is too easy</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; SunOS i86pc; rv:5.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; SunOS i86pc; rv:5.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0 With all recent builds of Firefox, tricking a user into accepting a self-signed certificate is quite a hassle. There is the familiar two-step process of the warning page (http://cmi0814604.student.cmi-hro.nl/mozilla/ff5certwarn1.jpg) and the confirmation page (http://cmi0814604.student.cmi-hro.nl/mozilla/ff5certwarn2.jpg). The user is given a clear explanation about the dialog, and the user therefor is aware of the consequences of adding such an exception. When pushing a root CA to a client, this situation changes. Users are confronted with a minimal dialog (as can be seen here: http://cmi0814604.student.cmi-hro.nl/mozilla/ff5rootca.jpg). Of course, the more technical people will know they are doing something potentially disastrous, but this won't be the case with the average computer user. They will, most likely, not understand what this is about. When a user is, for example, connected to some open access point, it regularly happens that there is some kind of "guidelines" page telling the user about the rules of the hotspot. When this concerns a rogue access-point, a potential attacker can use such a page with instructions on how to add a self signed certificate (with a fancy issuer name) to the Firefox installation. My guess is that most users would blindly accept this claim, and therefore have lost a lot of the protection of certificates. The rogue access point can generate certificates for every website that's visited, and they will all be accepted by the client. This hypothesis seems to be supported by asking around with some non-technical people around me. I figured this should at least be discussed here at Mozilla, so here's the idea.

      <title>back/forward buttons share menu and are stuck together; old versions had separate functionality</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.17) Gecko/20110420 Firefox/3.6.17 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729) Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.17) Gecko/20110420 Firefox/3.6.17 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729) in older versions of firefox, the back button and forward button were two completely separate buttons. each one had the unique ability to show only the back history and forward history, respectively. the key broken functionality that i personally encounter are: 1. for people who frequently browse backward and forward multiple pages (think 10 or even 20) at a time, the new (horrible) way of doing this requires right-clicking on back/forward, select the page farthest on the list, right-click again, select the next page farthest on the list, and repeat ad nauseum. previously, one right click on the back button would let me go backward (or forward) 10 pages with that one right-click. 2. forcing these two buttons next to each other breaks two UI preferences that used to exist. first, i hardly ever use the forward button at home and prefer to get rid of that button altogether. secondly, at work i do use both buttons, and i put the refresh button between the back and forward button to visually split them up a little. both of these were taken care of by an extension called "NoUn Buttons" (no unified buttons), and i was able to upgrade to firefox 3 while still being able to keep existing behavior. unfortunately the developer of that extension is no longer working on it, and i have looked and asked and looked some more for another way to prevent breaking my UI behavior if i upgrade to ff4 or higher and have found nothing. can we please get this functionality put back into our browser by default? this is firefox, not chrome, and it should act like it. chrome is not what i installed. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. browse to a few pages (let's say 10) 2. go back in history up to 9 pages 3. right click on the back/forward button Actual Results: a list of pages, both behind and ahead of the current page, is displayed. the cache on both directions is quite small. Expected Results: a list of behind pages if i click on the back button and a list of ahead pages if i click on the forward button. both lists are a decent length (around 10).</description>

      <title>Clickable / draggable tabs in Session restore</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0.1) Gecko/20110504 Firefox/4.0.1 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0.1) Gecko/20110504 Firefox/4.0.1 In Session Restore, sometimes you do not want to actually restore anything (maybe you know restoring will crash Firefox, although you do not know exactly which tab or combination of tabs is the culprit). In this situation, it would be extremely useful if individual window titles could be dragged out (perhaps into a separate Firefox instance, or into a mail composition window) and the URL could be obtained by right-clicking. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Visit about:sessionrestore 2. Attempt to copy or drag individual tab titles Actual Results: None Expected Results: Dragging a tab title into another browser window should open the corresponding page in that browser window. Dragging a tab title into some other context should paste the corresponding URL into the drag destination. Right-clicking a tab title should offer a context menu with "Copy URL" (and perhaps "Open in a new window" etc) I'm reluctant to suggest that the tab titles should be actual links, because that would make it too easy to accidentally navigate away from the sessionrestore context. But it should be possible to extract the URLs for individual tabs, for example for pasting into a bug report like this one. Power users can certainly reason about how this is implemented and discover the sessionstore.js file, and copy+paste out of that, but this is at best a cumbersome and clumsy workaround for the masochistic elite.</description>

      <title>Undo for Start new session</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0.1) Gecko/20110504 Firefox/4.0.1 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0.1) Gecko/20110504 Firefox/4.0.1 When you accidentally click Start new session (as further discussed in bug #477322, this is not altogether too uncommon), you should be able to Undo. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Crash, or quit, by accident or by choice. Restart Firefox. Get Session Restore 2. Accidentally click Start new session Actual Results: New session, apparently losing ability to restore the session you were about to restore. Undo is greyed out and ctrl-Z does nothing. History &gt; Restore previous session is also greyed out, for some odd reason (this is probably a separate bug). Expected Results: Undo and ctrl-Z should behave the same as the Back button. I only discovered the Back button and the about:sessionrestore URL by reading Bugzilla in preparation for filing this bug report. Although the data loss is only perceived, not real, it appears to the end user as if the session restore data was lost. As documented in e.g. bug #558425, once you plunge ahead and create a new session, and eventually quit Firefox, the data loss will be committed to disk as well unless you discover in time that the old session data can in fact still be salvaged. Although fixing bug #648081 would reduce the risk of data loss, the lack of Undo is a usability problem in its own right.</description>

      <title>Web Developer menu needs a name change as addon confuses things.</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:7.0a1) Gecko/20110622 Firefox/7.0a1 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:7.0a1) Gecko/20110622 Firefox/7.0a1 There is a Web Developer addon that places a menu with the same name as your new Web Developer Menu. This could be a bit confusing to some people, not much of a problem, but would be a good idea to change the name to something such as Developer. Both Apple and Google has theirs named Developer, so it's probably a good idea to copy this. Another thing that might be worth thinking about is Apple puts their developer tools in a whole new menu for developer and Google puts it in the view menu. I would say Apple took the wrong approach here and Google took the right one as your viewing the source and viewing the console, ect... This would be something I would say to think about. I know they are also tools, but I think the tools menu should be for addons only (I may be crazy). Reproducible: Always</description>

      <title>Window's close button should close current tab instead of current window</title>

This also has the advantage of obeying Fitt's law. To do this, I suggest adding a new value (4) to browser.tabs.closeButtons which does all of the following: 1. Don't display any close buttons at all (same as value 2) 2. Makes left clicking on the window's close button close the current tab instead of the current window 3. Makes right clicking on the window's close button close the current window (???) Reproducible: Always</description>

      <title>Enhancement - Make new Javascript annoyance stoppable</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:5.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:5.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0 Most of the possible nags are stoppable with the 'Advanced' button of Javascript preferences. These are the current possibilities: [] Move or resize existing windows [] Raise or lower windows [] Disable or replace context menu The remaining two from previous versions of Firefox are now obsolete because we don't have a status bar any more. So far so good. But we still have the title text of web pages and, as you can see when you call the following link, this title text is increasingly misused in the same way as the previously annoying scrolling text in the status bar. Here is an example of a scrolling title text http://www.hscripts.com/scripts/JavaScript/title-scrol.php I believe that this is not only an annoyance but may also include a security risk, because if the title of a web page is *changeable at any time* it's made easier to palm off a fake page on the user. In any case, it seems a bit more critical than changing the text in the status bar. So it would be a good idea to add the possibility to stop this from happening. Reproducible: Always</description>

      <title>Paste &amp; Go/Search is uninformative jargon</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:5.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:5.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0 Labelling this context menu command ‘Paste &amp; Go’ or ‘Paste &amp; Search’ has several problems: 1. Instead of actually telling the user what will be done, it construes the command as a sequences of two other commands. This requires that you first understand those two other commands, while it also requires you to remember what’s in the clipboard. 2. It is inconsistent with the rest of Firefox and most other interfaces, because it’s rare to see a command worded as a sequences of two other commands. It makes me wonder, ‘Are the other two commands so inefficient that we need a separate command to put them together as a workaround?’ 3. Paste &amp; Search is inconsistent with a similar command: if I select ‘Bugzilla@Mozilla’ at the top of this page and right-click, I see ‘Search Google for "Bugzilla@Mozill…"’. If, on the other hand, I copy that text and right click in the Search bar, I just see ‘Paste &amp; Search’. Both commands are identical, so the labels should be identical. 4. ‘Paste’ is misleading because it’s not just pasting, but replacing the entire text of the Location/Search bar and then pasting. This confusion has led to several bug reports, including bug 616678 and bug 628008. Reproducible: Always Expected Results: I expect the command to tell me exactly what it will do. In the Location bar, if there’s a URL in the clipboard, the context menu should show this: Go to &lt;URL&gt; Where &lt;URL&gt; is replaced with the URL in the clipboard, truncated to a set length. If the copied text is not a URL, or if the we’re in the Search bar, the command should be: Search &lt;selected search engine&gt; for &lt;copied text&gt; This should be identical to the command for selected text on a page (and should ideally reuse the same code).</description>

      <title>Deleting tabs in succession doesn't work when scroll buttons are present in the tab strip.</title>
      <description>Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:7.0a1) Gecko/20110623 Firefox/7.0a1 Deleting tabs in succession doesn't work when scroll buttons are present in the tab strip. Step to reproduce: 1. Start Firefox and open some blank tabs until the scroll buttons appear in the tab strip. 2. Select first tab from the strip and begin closing the tabs from the "x" button until the scroll buttons disappear. Actual results: When the scroll buttons disappear, the whole strip is resized leaving the "x" button of the tab not focused by the mouse cursor anymore, meaning that you have to move the mouse in order to continue closing the tabs. Expected results: You should be able to delete all the tabs continuously. Not resizing the tabs until you move the mouse off the tabbar is a great thing and in my opinion the scroll buttons must have the same behavior. The buttons must disappear only when you move the mouse off the tabstrip.</description>

Some user may want to prevent autoplay for video/audio content. There has been quite some evangelism to explain how much html5 video is better than flash videos since html5 videos are under the control of the browser and then under the control of the user. it would be a good idea i think to allow the user to set the pref from the preference window Note that preference window [1] already has an item in Content panel to choose to load images automatically or not.

      <title>Implement keyboard shortcut hold threshold timer for Quit (CMD/Ctrl + Q)</title>
      <description>As far as I'm aware, currently Chromium v14 [1] implements a very useful minimal feature that ultimately places a press duration threshold on the shortcuts for Quitting the browser: Command/Ctrl-Q. This ultimately acts as a preventative measure for accidentally closing the window when using keyboard shortcuts, such as the case for incidentally hitting Q when one meant to hit W (Close Window). The method at which this is detailed to the end-user is via a visible toaster alert that simply indicates: "Hold ⌘Q to Quit", or Hold Control+Q to Quit". I would love to see this minimal feature added to the Firefox product in the future. Currently testing this on Chromium 14.0.805.0 (90675)</description>

      <title>Cookie handling in IFrames</title>
      <description>User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:5.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0 Build ID: 20110627180347 Steps to reproduce: The actual page I visited was http://www.securvita.de/egk/ but that page is in German, and might change or vanish before this bug here is fixed. So I'll describe things in a more general example. 1. Disable third party cookies 2. Visit page containing iframe from another domain, say outer.com/outer containing an iframe with the document inner.com/first. The inner.com/first document tried to set a cookie. 3. Press form button inside iframe, with the form submission directed to inner.com/second Actual results: inner.com/second requires the cookie set by inner.com/first, but with third party cookies disabled, FF5 won't send that cookie. So the page doesn't work. Expected results: Disabling third party cookies should prevent cookies being sent to inner.com in response to a page load for outer.com, as this would allow third-party user tracking. But interacting with the form inside inner.com should be a different matter. I propose associating a kind of temporary cookie jar with every inner frame. Documents initially loaded into that iframe would store cookies in that temporary jar. When loading a different document inside that same iframe in response to some user action (as opposed to a javascript timeout or a reload meta tag), then the temporary jar is merged into the main cookie jar, and subsequent loads in that iframe will send cookies in just the way that top level documents do. The rationale is that by interacting with the iframe, the user implicitely expressed a certain trust in that content. So it very likely isn't a tracking advertisement. I'm not sure how much of the "reloade due to user interaction" machinery is present, but I guess one could start on the safe side with links and form submissions only, no scripting involved.</description>

      <title>Add pref to change number of directories shown at one time in edit this bookmark window</title>
      <description>User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:5.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0 Build ID: 20110622105737 Steps to reproduce: double click on the bookmark icon in the awesome bar Actual results: The last used folder (aka directories), only 5 are listed because the window is too small, and cannot be re-sized Expected results: Need a setting about:config, or in the pref, or simply a control on the window (drag) to increase the height of the window. It's inconvenient to have to select several times a different directory, while there is enough screen estate to display a list of the most 10 or 20 last used directories (and yes, I do use tags, but directories do also have a purpose to group my bookmark)</description>

      <title>provide an easy way to exit fullscreen mode</title>
      <description>User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.0) AppleWebKit/534.30 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/12.0.742.100 Safari/534.30 Steps to reproduce: Not sure. Was switching between browser and other applications. Actual results: Browser controls disappeared: tabs, menus, title bar, everything. The browser consisted then of nothing but a rendered web page, with no controls other than the links on that particular web page. Restarting the browser did NOT fix this, so apparently I will need to reinstall. Expected results: Obviously, this should not happen spontaneously, and if the browser has any sort of "full-screen" mode, the standard toggle-full-screen-mode binding alt-enter should undo it and there should be a right-click menu option that undoes it, nor should it persist across restarts. As it is, whether this is a pure bug or a feature, plus bugs that can toggle it on randomly and that make it impossible to toggle it back off again if you don't know exactly how, it's rendered the browser virtually unusable since there's no obvious way to put it back to normal short of deleting and reinstalling Firefox.</description>

      <title>Create Home screen shortcuts from bookmarks using a shell shortcut launcher</title>
      <description>Problem: Home screen shortcuts cannot be created from Aurora bookmarks. No option is provided in the context menu for bookmarks in the Bookmarks tab of Aurora. No option for Aurora Bookmarks is shown in the Home screen "Add to Home Screen" Shortcuts list (which does include items such as "Bookmark", "ConnectBot", and "Dropbox Folder"). Workaround: Manually copy bookmarks to the built-in Browser application bookmarks list and then add shortcuts to those. Parity: The stock Browser can create home screen shortcuts from the bookmarks list, and lists Bookmark as an available shortcut in the "Select shortcut" dialog.

      <title>User preference to prevent cross-domain cookie-based tracking</title>
      <description>_tl;dr_ Add a preference for users to opt-out of cross-domain cookies __The problem__ One problem of generated by cookies is cross-domain tracking. When first loading a resource from tracking.com (example name. I don't know if the domain is actually used and I don't care) (inserted image, visiting tracking.com itself, etc.), tracking.com can set a cookie. Later requests to tracking.com will send this cookie, regardless of whether you visit tracking.com or any other site. Some website store in the cookie an identifier used to identify from which user the requests come from. Combined with the Referer (sic) HTTP header, not only tracking.com can identify a person, but also a browsing behavior in the tracking.com domain (which I consider acceptable) AND any other website embedding a tracking.com (which is an issue). This is very well explained and visualized by http://collusion.toolness.org/ __The basic idea__ If I'm visiting a website from a particular origin, do NOT send cookies to other domains. This has several limitations of course. __Limitations__ * In some cases, the cookies could be useful anyways, so Firefox should not impose to not send the cookies, hence the idea of a user preference option. * Some requests should always send cookies. iframes, for instance, since their content is very likely to depend on cookies. Not sending cookies could break the browing experience. * I don't know what to think of cross-domain XHR. __Technical details__ * If not sending the Cookie header to a tracking domain, this one is likely to send the cookie again. I think that the best thing is to ignore this new cookie and keep the previous one. * Same-origin cookies should NOT be affected by this bug. __How could the preference be presented to the user?__ I see two ways to set the preference. * Block all cross-domain cookies except a user-provided white list * Block no cross-domain cookies except a user-provided black list (default and empty black list by default for the sake of not breaking the web) Both approaches could be provided to the user. One good thing later down the road would be to allow users sharing their lists. Maybe following the model used in AdBlock? Maybe through a Sync-like mechanism? With such a user preference, users will have a way to protect themselves from tracking. Something I hope more efficient than the Do-Not-Track header which is respected at the discretion of the server. _Warning_ Fixing this bug may affect worldwide economy</description>

They could enable the add-ons they use and would report on issues sooner and users on the stable version wouldn't have as many extensions break for them. Because it seems not every beta-users actually knows about the add-on compatibility reporter.</description>

Screen readers get them without any problems from the accessibility API. But there is no way to access them in Firefox via a shortcut or in the toolbar. Providing accesskey attributes on skiplinks pointing to the landmarks is the only way to access the landmarks to users with limited motor skills. Actual results: No way to access a landmark overview in Firefox. Expected results: Add a shortcut which opens a window displaying all the landmark regions and makes them accessible for limited motor skills users.</description>

      <title>Save modified document state in session restore (DOM, JS state)</title>
      <description>User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:8.0a1) Gecko/20110708 Firefox/8.0a1 Build ID: 20110708030800 Steps to reproduce: Firefox (Nightly) locked up, so I had to kill it. However, this applies equally well to when Firefox crashes. Actual results: When Firefox was restarts and restores the previous session, it reloads pages fresh, rather than restoring them to the state they were in before the crash. This particularly evident with regard to pages on tvtropes.org, where expanded subsections and scroll position are lost. For instance: (1) Load this page: http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall (2) Expand the "Live Action TV" section (or any other section) (3) Crash or quit Firefox (4) Restart and go back to the tab with this document Expected results: Particularly when Firefox crashes or locks up, I don't want to lose my place or lose any work. Firefox should strive to restore my session EXACTLY as it was before it **** out on me. I don't care if the content is stale. If it's out of date when I restart the session, then it was out of date at the point before it crashed, and I want to see what I was looking at before the crash. In other words, Firefox should come back up and make it appear as if it never went down in the first place. Therefore, Firefox should not reload the page. It should restore the session, precisely as each page was before the crash, including any dynamic content, persistent Javascript variables, the whole nine yards. Perhaps another way to say this is that Firefox should not simply record metadata about the session. It should record checkpoints or snapshots and then restore those. (This is analogous to what is done in some high-availability servers, where the system takes periodic checkpoints of processes and/or VMs that are running so that if a node goes down, the processes can seamlessly and transparently restart from the last checkpoint on some other node.) That being said, because of bugs, some checkpoints could be bogus, so perhaps the user should have three choices on restore: (a) New (empty) session, (b) Full restore from checkpoint, and (c) Reload previous session's documents from the web.</description>

It would be great if the Panorama workspace could be larger than the window size. This would make it possible to organize a larger number of groups (&gt;4, say) while still having meaningful display of the tabs contain within. At the moment, there is an implicit limit on the number of tab groups, which limits usefulness. One could scroll around the workspace using scrollbars, but also by dragging the empty spaces between the tab groups with the mouse.</description>

Expected results: The upgrade should have considered the changed semantic of "Clear all cookies on firefox exit" to avoid the destructive change. A new configuration option for handling proper web cookies and flash shared local objects differently should be created. The upgrade procedure should then have asked for clarification or should have defaulted to a setting of "Clear all web cookies on exit" checked and "Clear all flash shared objects on exit" unchecked to avoid user loss of data.</description>

Actual results: Tried to use a wildcard (e. g. *.googlesyndication.com) to remove a whole bunch of sub-servers (in this case the ever-present Google Ads) but this did not work; I had to specify the exact server name. And that means if I want to filter out said "whole bunch of servers," the only way out will be to specify each server explicitly. (Which may be a list of 20 servers.) Expected results: Wildcards ought to be accepted. Thanks for considering.</description>

      <title>Update print preview design</title>
      <description>Created attachment 546879 [details] Mockup With the recent trends and improvements seen in the Firefox interface, it is a shame that the Print Preview function still looks a little out-dated. While there has been a movement to move dialog boxes so that they appear within the window itself, the Print Preview dialog does this, yet still manages to look out of place in the new look. I propose that this interface be tweaked a bit in order to match with the current look of our default theme. Rather than "locking" the rest of the window, the toolbar for a tab in Print Preview mode would replace the navigation toolbar. This design also uses drop-down menus themed to look more in line with the current design of the browser. While many would still want the Print and Print Preview windows combined into a general integrated Print dialog (perhaps, like the one in Office 2010), this would be a step in the right direction, and could influence the further design of such a window.</description>

As a possible replacement for bookmarks bar and great way to achieve more space for netbook users, Panorama could also have bookmark functionality. How it would work: User opens site, then Panorama and by right-clicking on thumbnail he choice "Save this page off-line". Panorama will then save screenshot of bookmarked page and will be available for him all the time, even after restart. Pros: No other browser has it! More precious pixels for page content. Cons: Requires more clicks to access bookmarks.</description>

      <title>URL preview should not truncate the middle</title>
      <description>Gentlemen, when one puts the mouse upon a link, a preview of the URL is shown at the bottom of the screen. However for some DUMB REASON, it is truncated with its middle parts removed. That is just as bad as removing the front or the back. ESPECIALLY with tons of room remaining on the screen to show it. For SOME REASON you try to make it only fit half the width of the screen, DESPITE there being a whole right half of the screen to show the full URL. So you think NOBODY cares what the middle part of the URL contains. Just CLICK it and find out, right?? Just install an extension to fix your bug and who cares, perhaps? NO PLEASE. Yes I reported http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=625829 and waited and waited and install stupid overkill non-working extensions and removed them.</description>

For instance, saving Planet Mozilla right now took 342MB, of which 337MB consisted of videos (.webm, .mp4, .ogv). I'd suggest that the Save dialog should have two separate checkboxes (or possibly one three-choice radio button), for "Include images and page styles" and "Include videos". (Bonus if the latter only shows up when the page has videos.)</description>

      <title>Hover and mouse-scroll search engine's favicon to change it</title>
      <description>I suggest adding the feature of changing currently used search engine by hovering it's favicon in the search bar and scrolling mouse wheel up/down. There also might be a pref added that would make the scroll wrap around the ends of the list (e.g. when you reach the bottom of the list and you scroll down once more, then the first entry of this list gets chosen). This behavior wouldn't do any harm, since now the scrolling over favicon does nothing. And the profit of this feature would be a 2 saved clicks every time you change the search engine.</description>

(I tested only on Mac OS, so maybe there is a tooltip on other platforms)</description>

      <title>Stalled (unloaded) tabs should be styled to be visually distinguishable</title>
      <description>Since bug 586068 landed - there is a new state for every tab: it can be stalled (unloaded). But on the tab bar they look absolutely similar to the loaded tabs. In some cases a user might want to know whether the page is loaded or not. An example case may be a heavy (with lots of graphics) page that a user wanted to read later, when he has more free time to read the huge text on that page. After the restart of the browser, all the tabs gets stalled, as user has browser.sessionstore.max_concurrent_tabs = 0 as he feels more comfortable this way. Some other tabs may have been also postponed by the user in order to read them later, but now all he sees is tabs' titles, and he doesn't remember anymore whether this tab is that awfully heavy page, that he doesn't want to read now, or it is one of those small scientific articles he wanted to read later, when he was busy, but is willing to read now.</description>

      <description>User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:6.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/6.0 Build ID: 20110729080751 Expected results: I suggest to provide more themes (or colour versions) pre-installed in Firefox. It can help retain more users, when they can change themes directly in Firefox without installing any extra one from AMO. Providing more official themes will make them sure, that this theme will be there in the next version, unlike themes from AMO. Today many users don't like new default theme since FF4 or Glass effect on Aero Windows. If Mozilla provide theme version currently for non-Aero Windows, they will be satisfied. It's true that add-ons are simply accessible, but Firefox should offer some customizations basically without anything more installed. Shortly: My idea is to have more themes in Firefox installation (something like: modern, classic, futuristic, simple, small/minimalistic, rounded, angular, ... or ... blue, black, orange, ...).</description>

This would save having to scroll to the bottom of the next level of the menu hierarchy. This seems more natural to me than the current setup because "open in tabs" refers to the folder, wheras the "open in tabs" menu item is spatially near only the bookmark or bookmarks at the bottom of a folder. This is exascerbated when the last entry in the folder is another folder: Open in tabs will open the super-folder rather than the folder right next to the OIT menu-entry. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Double-click a folder in the bookmarks menu Actual Results: Nothing. Expected Results: Open all the bookmarks in the folder in tabs.</description>

      <title>Add Bookmark dialog: "Create in" combo box should have special "Show All Folders" entry</title>

Clicking on this entry will close the drop-down list and expand the dialog box so that the tree view displaying all available bookmark folders is visible. It would be inconvenient for the end user to have to search through the "Create in" combo box and find that the desired folder is not in the list of recently-used bookmark folders, and then have to click on the arrow button to display the full list of available bookmark folders. Implementing this enhancement will save time, not to mention needless mouse moving and clicking. Also, this enhancement will eliminate the confusion over the combo box not showing all available bookmark folders. At least one user in the Mozilla Firebird user support forum has expressed his confusion over this "glitch" (see &lt;http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=43631&gt;), and I myself was about to report this as an actual bug.

      <description>When the [ v ] button is clicked, the tree view shows up below. If the dialog is exited somehow (by adding the bookmark or hitting Cancel), upon reopening the dialog the tree view is now gone. Can we make the state of this (hidden|visible) be persistent (or somehow change it so it can be made persistent if the user desires it)? I don't want to suggest a preference, but for users with a large folderized bookmarks list, the desired folder is not always in the recent list.</description>

A more user friendly way would be to open a new window like Windows does when a second Firebird is launched. So basically detect that an instance is already launched and open a new window. If this is possible it would be much nicer. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.Open one instance of Firebird 2. Launch a second instance 3. Actual Results: Profile manager appears Expected Results: Should open a new window with the same profile that is already used by the other instance. The reason for this feature is when clicking on a link in an email another window would appear and go to that address.</description>

      <title>Custom Keywords in Location Bar (like google, dict)</title>

That was poorly worded, sorry, so I'll give an example. All search engines use querys. So could there be a feature where you could program in a keyword into a query? For instance: If I typed in "google" in the URL bar then a space and told Mozilla beforehand that if "google" was the first thing in the address bar, it would append what came after it to http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q= (and parse it as necessary) and go there. This has been done in Firebird already, but only with Google and Dictionary.com (and some others, such as Amazon). But sometimes there are other sites where I would like Firebird to be able to do this for as well, so it would be nice if there was some interface where the user could define these keywords. I know I posted this in the Mozilla section, but I think it could be used in Firebird as well. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

      <title>Implement Link Filter / Content Filter Rules (parental controls)</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.5) Gecko/20031007 Firebird/0.7 A feature I haven't seen so far in any browser: a link filter Similar to a spamfilter, that puts bogus mails straight into the trashcan, I'd like to have a filter system that does the same with links to bogus webpages. By bogus links I mean links that a normal user would never want to click on. Examples for bogus links: - advertisement banners - sponsors - links to porn pages - links to weird cgi scripts - ... I think it would be a great feature if a browser could just hide such links, by following a list of rulesets (simple RegExps would be sufficient for me). Surely everybody has noticed that more and more pages get filled with junk banners and stuff. I want to allow my browser to hide such page content from me (or replace it with some kind of symbol so that I know something is hidden there). It would make browsing a lot faster, because: - banner images don't have to be loaded - 'real' links wouldn't be hidden under loads of bogus ones - You Only See What You Want To See A more general filter, that does not only allow to filter links, but Images, or HTML Contents in general would be great, too. It could also help to restrict browsing features for children. Don't allow links that contain 'xxx', '****', etc. and most porn pages won't work anymore... or hide/disallow 'bad language' in general. It would be great to see some development in that direction :-) In my opinion, it would be a great new feature for a browser that already contains a whole lot of great new features :-) Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

      <title>Create standard web development extension for Firebird (DOM Inspector, Javascript Console, and Venkman)</title>
      <description>There should be a "standard extension" (see bug 222796) for Firebird called "Web Development Tools" that contains DOM Inspector, Javascript Console, and Venkman (if ready). These can then not be included with Firebird by default. This will make the browser lighter weight for people that don't need these features. When building "Browser", the .xpi for the extensions will be generated, but will be provided in a seperate directory on FTP and linked to from the page listing all the extensions that Mozilla.org maintains (bug 232845).</description>

      <title>Make View Source a Mozilla.org maintained Extension (Bundle)</title>
      <description>Bug 222796 is about "Standard extensions" By default, we can have View Source open a text/plain helper application (bug 172817), then we can outsource View Source to an extension available for people that don't have a good text/plain helper application to choose from. This will make Firebird more lightweight for the user who doesn't need View Source and is perfectly happy with the source code being loaded in notepad or what have you. When building "Browser", the .xpi for the extensions will be generated, but will be provided in a seperate directory on FTP and linked to from the page listing all the extensions that Mozilla.org maintains (bug 232845).</description>

      <title>Adding bookmark with same name should offer to overwrite/replace</title>
      <description>Reported by ZorbaTHut at http://www.kuro5hin.org/comments/2004/1/31/125914/125/114 ZorbaTHut likes to replace his webcomic bookmarks after catching up with the comic, so that each bookmark always points to the last strip he had read. In IE he can do that by bookmarking the new URL and selecting "replace" when IE tells him there is already a bookmark with that name. Steps to reproduce: 1. Add a bookmark. 2. Add a bookmark with the same name in the same folder. The URL can be the same or different. (Ctrl+D, drag proxy icon to personal toolbar.) Result: two bookmarks with the same name in the same folder. Expected: dialog with at least "Replace" and "Cancel" buttons. (Maybe also a "Rename" button or a "Keep both" button.) See also bug 10272, "Replace last bookmark".</description>

      <title>would be nice to turn off LAST_VISIT (and other items) in bookmarks</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.5) Gecko/20031007 Firebird/0.7 It would be useful to be able to turn off the LAST_VISIT item in bookmarks, which records the last date on which you viewed one of your bookmarked web pages, because a) it's private information about web page viewing habits that does not fall under any of the currently available "Privacy" options. The user doesn't know that this information is being stored, and in fact there is no way to see it without opening the file. b) it makes CVS tracking of bookmarks impossible due to numerous conflicts. c) it makes the bookmarks file bigger without adding any obvious functionality Perhaps all of the other miscellanous bookmark properties could be optionally turned off as well. Since Firebird won't care if they don't exist in the file, the only time anything special needs to be done is when writing the file out - this shouldn't be a tough one.

      <title>automatic capture mechanism for search toolbar?</title>
      <description>An idea occured to me that I thought Firebird developers may be interested in implementing. The search bar in Firebird is great and all (or so they tell me, I don't use it myself), and it's easy enough to click on a plugin to have your favorite search engine added. If, that is, there's a plugin available. And you can locate it. And it does the specific search you want. (Amazon DVDs, not the whole site!... etc) It seems to me it would be relatively simple to let a user "capture" any form field they want, for use in the search bar. Any search, no matter how small it's userbase, would be a click or two away from Mozilla's search UI. No writing a plugin or custom keyword for your companies intranet simply for your own personal use. Two UI implementations immediately come to mind. 1) Context menu of the search field. 2) Search bar's menu (more discoverable), which would then prompt you to click the field you wish to capture. I have various other ideas for how it could be implemented, but you guys probably have enough to go off of to determine if this is something of value. Cheers.</description>

      <description>User-Agent: Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.5) Gecko/20031007 Firebird/0.7 I would like to have a "unblock cokies from this site" menu-item (resp "block" if cookies where unblocked previously). Similar for Popups. Also "open cookie manager" ("open popup-manager" respectively) would be nice. Mozilla had those in the tools menu (i think), and i really came to like it. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: look at the menu Actual Results: If i visite a site (using firebird) that doesn't work because cookies (resp. popups) are bocked, i have to go to tools-&gt;options-&gt;privacy-&gt;cookies-&gt;exceptions, look for the site and change the status. VERY inconvenient. Expected Results: I would like to have a "unblock cokies from this site" (resp. "unblock popups") item in the tools menu, and/or in the page-context-menu. It would also be an option to integrate site-specific popup/cookie/image-settings etc into the Page-Info dialog. In Moz this used to be one click (ok, two with opening the menu). I WANT THAT BACK! becaus other than that, i like Firebird better ('cause it's smaller, faster and nicer. thank you very much...)</description>

      <title>Left and right mouse button to open link in new window</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7a) Gecko/20040115 Firebird/0.8.0+ Basic summary of what I am proposing: Whenever the user holds down and releases both the right and left mouse buttons at the same time, it would open the link in a new window. What led up to this: Over the months (and years) I have grown used to opening many links in a new window. In general I would browse the internet with lots of windows open and switch between them. That was when I used IE as my main browser. Now that I've been using Mozilla Firefox, I tend to use a combination of tabs and windows. I still have lots of websites open; they're just not all in a different window. However, one reason I don't open in a new window as often is because of the nice shortcut for opening in a new tab -- clicking the middle mouse button. I think it would be nice to also have a quick shortcut to open in a new window. Thus, I am proposing one possible way to do this. Some thoughts: 1) There aren't any other buttons available on a normal mouse (the right button is taken, the left button is taken, and the middle button is taken). 2) Also, a keyboard and mouse combo is not really a good idea, since that wouldn't be as simple as say the middle button click to open in a tab. 3) Thus, a combination of mouse buttons is the only other solution. The left and right button seem to be the natural choice. I also checked and found out that any combination involving the middle button seems more uncomfortable that the left and right button. Potential downsides I considered: 1) What if you press the left button before the right button or vice versa? This is actually not a problem. When you click on a link with the left button, the link is not followed until you release the button. In a similar manner, when you right click on a link, the context menu does not apear until you release the button. Thus, you can first press and hold down one button, then press and hold down the other, and then release the buttons with no problems. In fact, you could release one button and then the other at a different time, without problems. (It would just need to detect if the other button is pressed or not.) In otherwords, they don't have to be clicked or released at exactly the same moment. Note: If you press both buttons and then release one of them before the other, then Firefox should check to see if the other button is pressed in order not to trigger a right or left click. Definite downsides (that are not present with the middle click): 1) If you select some text on the page and then left click (and possibly in the future, if you right click), then the text will be deselected. 2) Unlike the middle mouse button, the left and right button might be used more often in triggering javascript. Thus, there could be potential issues there. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce:</description>

      <description>User-Agent: Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.5) Gecko/20031007 Firebird/0.7 History feature seems to be a little lacking; specifically, my complaints are: Searching history greater than 6 days old can become a bit unwieldy with the current design. Is there any reason for lumping older history together under a 'greater than 6 days old' heading? A better way to sort the history tab would be every day having its history stored together, e.g. every day is stored under a distinct heading rather than all history being stored under 'Greater than 6 days ago'. Additionaly, selecting a history period of 36500 days (~100 years) seems to break the history function, and causes the browser to retain history for "today" only.

      <title>no option to allow popups from https sites</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.5) Gecko/20040130 Firebird/0.7 There's a good case to be made for allowing popups from within https sites: most such sites will have a good reason for a pop-up (the overhead of any https transaction is such that you don't serve https requests when you don't have to). Most other popup killers allow this functionality. There's also a growing online purchasing authentication scheme called 3-D Secure implemented by Visa (Verified by Visa, see &lt;URL: http://usa.visa.com/personal/secure_with_visa/verified/how_it_works.html#&gt;), MasterCard (SecureCode), Amex and JCB which relies on this behaviour in most cases, and this will stop people being able to buy stuff online if it's not available. It's a sensible protocol in lots of ways, and we should allow people to use it. Sure, people can turn off popups for each site they buy from, but most consumers aren't not likely to know to do this, and following other popup killers would seem to make sense. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Unluckily, unless you already have a card which is registered under the scheme , you can't test the 3-D Secure protocol, but it should be easy enough to test against a vanilla https site with a pop-up window attached. 2. 3. Actual Results: The popup will be blocked if you've turned off popups in Options. Expected Results: There should be an option to allow https sites to put up popups.</description>

I suspect the the reason is that Processors before i686 are no longer supported. If that is the case I want to complain about that because nice fast browsers need to run on older machines. I am unable to build firefox myself because of the complexity of the build environemt. It works on a P3. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.Install firefox 2.run ./firefox 3.</description>

      <title>ability to reorder already opened tabs</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8 For me, and the way I browse the web, it would really be a benefit if I could easily changed the order of currently open tabs. This could be done as shortcut as well as via dragndrop (I personaly would prefer the latter). Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce:</description>

      <title>Firefox should override window manager setting that Ctrl+W closes windows</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040207 Firefox/0.8 When the window manager is configured to use Ctrl+W to close windows, it is not possible to close a tab through the Ctrl+W keyboard shortcut, as this closes the entire window. I know it's possible to do this, as Gnome Epiphany does the right thing -- close a tab when Ctrl+W is pressed. Similar support would also be needed on Mac OS X, at least to be similar to Apple Safari: the window isn't closed until the last tab is closed. Unfortunately this would require having a way to differentiate between the user pressing Ctrl+W, and the user clicking the window manager's close window button. The former should close the tab, the latter should close the window. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Configure your window manager so that Ctrl+W is used to close windows. a. For Gnome 2.2: click Applications -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Keyboard Shortcuts b. Change "Window Management/Close a window" to use &lt;Control&gt;w c. Close the Keyboard Shortcuts window. 2. Start Mozilla Firefox. 3. Open a new tab with Ctrl+T. There should be two tabs active. 4. Press Ctrl+W. Actual Results: The entire window closes, instead of the current tab. Expected Results: The current tab should have closed.</description>

      <title>Firefox: No "Set Default Browser" option in Mac OS X</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8 This is similar to bug 218271 (which is for Camino) about creating a Default Web Browser preference. In Mac OS 10.2 (and possibly earlier versions), setting a default browser was through Apple Menu &gt; System Preferences &gt; Internet. In OS 10.3, Apple has somewhat hidden that feature inside the Safari preferences. (I only found that preference by stumbling on it.) It would be nice to have a button in Firefox Preferences to set Firefox as the default browser, like in IE. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce:</description>

      <description>User-Agent: Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040210 Firefox/0.8 Having failed to add search engines via the toolbar search tool menu, I tried to do it via tools-options. But there is no method for it at all in the preferences menu. This brings home to me that the preferences menu does not cover all the configurable items. Take, for example, the adding of the "go" button. Should every configurable item be accessible through the preferences menu? Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

I believe that KDE uses this same standard so Why have you chosen to reverse theM? Makes no sense. Perhaps the Mac users and Red Hat users would be comfortable with this arrangement, but Window's users and KDE users would not be. do the math! How many users are you willing to alienate? I know that I will not be using Firefox or any browser based on that code until these buttons are fixed.</description>

      <title>Accept charset HTTP header used is not too good and unconfigurable</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040210 Firefox/0.8 The accept-charset header sent along approximately every web page request to server is by default somewhere along the lines "iso-8859-1,*,utf-8". For most sites it's just fine, but every once in a while there appears some clever scripts or perhaps even server software trying to act smart and usually they end up messing up euro symbols and few others in dynamic content they're producing. Also Firebird offers no obvious way to change these headers, and using intl.accept-charset seems not to work with eg. "iso-8859-15,iso-8859-15,*,utf-8". Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Set charset prefs from intl.accept-charset to something more sane than the defaults 2. Open charset negotiated page or page that displays http headers sent Actual Results: Wrong characters (eg. negation symbol instead euro) appear or header different from the actual preferences appear. Expected Results: Right charset should've been requested and served.</description>

      <title>css width statement ignored for "a" tags</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8 The CSS with statement seems to be ignored for &lt;a...&gt;...&lt;/a&gt; tags. When creating active menus, it is helpful, and saves coding, to be able to force an &lt;a&gt; element to take the full width allowed by the parent element. For example: &lt;div style="width: 250px;"&gt; &lt;a style="width: 100%;" href="http://www.foo.com"&gt;foo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt; In Mozilla, the above code will produce a 250 pixel wide &lt;div&gt;, containing a link only as wide as the letters "foo". In Internet Explorer, the above code will produce a 250 pixel wide &lt;div&gt;, containing a 250 pixel wide link. This is not DOM standard, but it is very useful, and would reduce coding efforts significantly. Instead of controlling background colors of an active, dynamic menu with javascript, it can be done with CSS (via "a" and "a:hover" property assignments), and save considerable overhead. For now, I use javascript to accomplish this in gecko, and CSS to accomplish it in IE. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: See details.</description>

      <title>Ability to disable form autocomplete for username fields</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8 Firefox has the option to auto fill in passwords and also to fill in forms. I have disabled the saved passwords feature for security but have enabled saved form information. (cos it's useful!) What I don't like about form fill is that it doesn't distinguish between normal fields and username fields (especially in HTTPS websites). I don't like leaving my username in the open because it's like giving half the key to a potential hacker in my view. IE has a check box which allows you to disable filling in username and passwords. I would like to request for a similar feature to enable form fill but prevent Firefox from filling up username fields. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Enter logon website 2. Enter username and password 3. Actual Results: On reentering the website, and typing my username. The formfill feature displays my full username. Expected Results: Should there be an option to disable username formfill, no username would be prompted.</description>

      <title>Ctrl+tab should switch through recent tabs</title>
      <description>Found in Mozilla Firefox 0.8 release. After opening multiple tabs in a window, I want to switch back and forth between a few. Ctrl+tab seems to cycle through the tabs in order from left to right in the window. It would better match my expectations -- perhaps erroneously based on treating tabs as a window replacement -- and usage needs to cycle through them in order of last focus. This would be more consistent with the Alt+tab behavior with windows. I frequently switch back and forth between two web pages to compare them. To reproduce: Open multiple tabs in a window. Pick a tab (tab1), then pick another tab (tab2), preferably such that tab2 is not right next to tab1. Press Ctrl+tab. Actual: It switched to whatever tab is to the right of tab2. Expected: It switches to tab1. Ideally this would cycle through all the tabs in order of most recent focus. Depending on the speed of switching tabs, I'd almost rather see this highlight the tabs at the top of the window in historical order of focus as I continue to press Ctrl+tab and only actually switch to the page when I've released the keys (just like alt+tab for windows). This may also be less distracting when picking the tab to switch to since the pages aren't flashing by. I don't think treating the browser window as a tabbed dialog makes sense. I can see the logic of having ctrl+tab move forward to the next tab on the right in tabbed dialogs (it's a windows UI standard and dialogs should be for infrequent use). I don't believe this makes sense in the typical usage of multiple web pages opened in a single window. Most recently viewed is a well understood user concept and is the heart of the back button.</description>

      <title>Tab Grouping</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.5) Gecko/20031007 Firebird/0.7 A more than useful feature would be group tabbing. At work I tend to have open more than 20 tabs, opening up and closing tabs all the time. While searching for a topic in google, I often open-up half a dozen search results. While browsing a forum, I open up all potentially interesting threads in the background. (etc.) And while tabbed browsing is something I couldn't live without, it tends to become "inadequate" to use in such scenarios (with quite a lot of tabs), even more so when most of the tabs would be naturally grouped in sets, yet are "unordered" in the tab menu. To correct the problem I tend to open up 3-5 Mozilla Windows, 5-10 tabs in each window. A google search that seems to return many "good" results tends to get copied/pasted-opened in a new window, tomcat/jetspeed related tabs go to another, forums/blogs/news/pages I visit daily go to a third etc. And while Windows XP greatly lessens the problem for me with its tabbed taskbar, a tab grouping in a single Mozilla Window (I imagine preferrably through the sidebar; where clicking in a "tab group" would show in the main window the correspoding set of tabs, the others disappearing in the background) would be even better. I guess the description could be better but I hope you get the idea. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce:</description>

      <title>Find in this page, the message box that pops up stating 'the text you entered was not found' blocks the Find box.</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8 When opening the find dialog (Edit &gt; Find in this page), if the text entered is not found, the message box / popup appears in the way of the Find dialog. This is annoying having to press OK every time if you have a large text document that you want to search for various words / strings. I think a better solution would be for the 'Find in this Page' dialog to expand down, with a fieldset called 'messages', which would display 'The text you entered was not found'. Then you can choose to 'hide' the expanded section, or you could just type something else in and try again. Once you start to type again the message would disappear. This is hard to explain, I will try and create an image of what I mean and attach it. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Visit www.google.com 2. Go to 'Edit &gt; Find in this Page' 3. In the 'Find What:' textbox enter a string of text that isn't on the google front-page, such as 'hajhfahdjfajdhf jhjshdjfhue' and hit enter. Actual Results: A message box popped up informing me that 'The Text you entered was not found' Expected Results: The 'Find in this page' dialog should expand downwards showing a 'messages' fieldset, which can display various messages. The main 'Find in this Page' dialog should have a &lt;show / hide&gt; button for the 'Messages' expand-out area.</description>

      <title>should be able to 'copy link location' on bookmarks</title>
      <description>I think "Copy Link Location" should be added to the bookmark item context menu. At least with my usage, this is the most common thing I right-click a bookmark for. Presently, you either have to load the bookmark, then copy the text in the URL bar, or open the (slow to load) properties dialog, select the text inside, copy it to the clipboard, and then close the dialog. One-click access in the context menu would be very helpful when I'm sharing URLs via IRC/IM. Setting to UNCO. If someone agrees they can NEW it.</description>

This is confusing, especially for people who are directed to the profile manager from the support forums or some support sites. It would be better if the profile manager was able to recognize this, and automatically close all opened browser windows (obviously, this would require a confirm button to prevent inadvertent dataloss). A quick (but dirty) work-around would be to display a page in the newly opened browser window that tells the user to shut down all Fx windows first and _then_ open the profile manager.

      <description>User-Agent: Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040210 Firefox/0.8 As it is now, autocomplete always start from the beginning of the previously typed words. That means that if you don't remember the start of an address, only parts of it or the end ("I know it was something like '.../xul/rules.html'"), you will not be able to utilize the autocomplete feature. If you *only* have lets say 'www.mozilla.org' and 'www.bugzilla.org' stored and you type 'zilla' in the location field nothing will show. It would be nice if all typed words containing 'zilla' would be shown, as is done when using Find As You Type. The drop-down could display all results starting with the typed string and after them the results containing the string. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce:</description>

      <title>modifier key to show Opening dialog for known filetypes</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8 Sometimes the user wants to override their default behavior when clicking filetypes. There is already an override (Alt on Windows) to download files, but I think there should be an override to show the Opening dialog too. This would allow the user to select an external application to open the file with rather than saving the download, opening the file, and deleting the file when they're done. There are many examples, but just one might be clicking a link to an mp3, which is often handled by a plugin. If the user instead wishes to have the mp3 play in their media player (perhaps so they can browse away from the page w/o unloading the plugin and interrupting the audio), they would have to either unassociate the plugin or download the file and open it manually.

      <description>User-Agent: Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7a) Gecko/20040208 Firebird/0.8.0+ This feature of galeon is more practical than single close button currently used (this might be related to the fact, that galeon could place tab handles on the left/right, thus not being so space constrained). Closing tab with individual close button is much faster than travelling with mouse across the screen. Using context menu is also quite slov and requires more concentration. Also keyboard shortcuts are not the answer, since it requires correct focus and thus require 2 step process and more attention and are more prone to mistakes.

      <title>Would like to be able to open links from other applications in the same browser windows but different tab</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Build Identifier: Now that firefox is out, I tend to like it a bit more than safari--with its extensions and all. The only thing keeping me from using it is the one problem I keep having but don't know how to fix with the firebird/firefox line. In safari, we are able to open links from other applications(i.e. mail) in the same browser window but a different tab; I like this feature a lot. However, from what I've seen in firebird/firefox, mozilla, and camino( ithink) is that when click a link in another application, instead of opening in the same page but a different tab, it opens up a whole new window. Is there any setting I haven't found that can change this? It's not that big a problem, but does get annoying when I follow my usual routine of checking all mail first, and then reading associated links afterward. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.click on a link in mail, for example. 2.action opens up a new window, instead of a new tab in the same window 3. Would like for the action to open up a new tab in the main window Actual Results: New window opens. Can be cumbersome when opening multiple links in other applications(i.e. mail). Expected Results: Open the link in a new tab either in the foreground or background.</description>

      <title>Feature request: Some way to open a new window/tab with the same "back" stack</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8 I would love some way to open a new window or tab with the same page open as was open in the tab that was active before, and with the same stack of pages in the Back list as was in the old tab's back list. Why? This behaviour is very handy. Suppose I'm browsing along (say, through a mailing list archive), and I decide that I want to open the page two steps back in my Back list in a new tab, keeping the current one open so I can quickly flip back and forth. With the functionality I'm suggesting, doing this is as easy as opening a new tab and then going back two pages. This could be implemented as a preference toggle that would make the normal File menu and context menu's "New Window" and "New Tab" options behave this way. Or, another menu item could be added to do this (something like "Duplicate Tab/Window"). Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

      <description>User-Agent: Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7a) Gecko/20040213 Firebird/0.8.0+ Currently, when a URL cannot be retrieved, a pop-up appears. However, this pop-up method if detrimental in a number of ways. 1) It provides no way to copy the URL and paste it somewhere else. 2) It does not allow the user to edit the URL is for some reason it was misspelled. 3) In a number of instances, the user may simply click the OK button knowing what the message was about. However, at that point they no longer know the URL that could not be accessed, and thus, that URL is forever lost. (Adding "dataloss" keyword for this reason.) 4) This would provide a more comfortable transition to Firefox (from IE). Thus, I am proposing that we set browser.xul.error_pages.enabled to true as the default setting for all Firefox builds. Note: I was told that the reason we are waiting to enable this feature is because of some bugs in the error_pages. Currently, I only have seen one bug which involves hitting the back button in the browser. I don't see why they can't be marked as blocking this bug, however.

I'd like to see the Baysian filtering from Thunderbird integrated into Firefox, so that it could learn from your bookmark filing and provide the most likely options for the folders to file the current page under. Ideally, filing a bookmark in a sub-folder would also produce an effect on the learning of the parent folder as well. For example, if I go to file my first bookmark on Python programming, it may be similar to bookmarks in Programming/C++ and Programming/Java, but not particularly biased towards either subfolder, so the parent folder would be a good suggestion. Now, I believe that similar suggestions have been made for email filing in Thunderbird, so I imagine that this kind of thing will probably be worked on there first, but I believe that it may be good to keep this suggestion in mind, so that design decisions made there would allow for the message filing to be ported over to bookmarks as well.

      <title>Shift should not be required to drag around folders on personal toolbar</title>
      <description>If I try to drag a folder on the personal toolbar it opens, and I am unable to move it. I understand the value of having the menu open on mousedown (for click-drag-release bookmark opening) but I think there's room for some logic that if the mouse begins to move over a geographic area that would imply the folder was to be moved (i.e. outside the range of usual click-drag-release bookmark opening) then the menu would be rolled up and the folder relocated on the toolbar.</description>

      <title>Startup Time Speedup Request</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8 I'm a no developer for FireFox/FireBird. I'm just saying this from an End-User perspective. IE v.s. FireBird ---------------- I like IE very much because it has a pretty fast speed and most of the sites look perfect with no rendering problems. I like FireBird because it has a REALLY nice User Interface with the Search Bar embedded and all those cool features. PLUS, it's faster compared to Mozilla. However, its startup time is really slow compared to IE. Is there a way to get the startup time close to IE on PC Windows platform? &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; NOTE &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I am more concerned about COLD startup time. That'd make FireFox A WHOLE lot better :-) and more competitive ;-) Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce:</description>

      <description>User-Agent: Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8 I am currently unable to run Firefox as my default browser because my girlfriend likes to use Internet Explorer. We have two separate Administrator accounts on Windows XP, and for some reason when I set Firefox as my default browser, it gets set as the default under her account as well. It is my opinion that default browser settings should be on a per-account basis, and setting my default browser to Firefox should not change her default setting of Internet Explorer. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Set Firefox as the default browser under one Windows XP account 2. Login under another Windows XP account on the same machine 3. Go to Start, Run and type in www.mozilla.org and hit OK Actual Results: URL opens in Firefox instead of IE (or whatever the default browser was for that account).

      <description>User-Agent: Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040207 Firefox/0.8 One of my favorite things about Safari is it's "Activity" window. It will show you exactly what parts of a page are loading, and you can manually cancel each part. For example, if the browser is slowing down by waiting to download a specific gif image, I can go in and cancel that specifically. Since I'm on dialup and content size matters, I can also go in and view how big a quicktime movie/flash animation is, and how much of it has loaded so far. This is very, very useful, and much better then just staring at a non-informative progress bar. The window, like safari's, should be brought up manually by going to a menu entry, for example, Tools &gt; Activity. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce:</description>

      <description>User-Agent: Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8 Currently you can only specify one parameter for custom keyword searches or queries, using %s. This potentially limits the input you can pass to specific websites where it may be advantageous to use custom keywords. Example below, quoted from &lt;a href="http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=57271"&gt;more identifiers like %s - MozillaZine Forums&lt;/a&gt;. ------- Quote -------- for example: the 3 strings between the '*' in the following link are editable http://www.tvtoday.de/tv/programm/programm.php?ztag=1&amp;sparte=*alle*&amp;uhrzeit=Ax*01*&amp;sender=*HS* (if you want to visit that page you have to remove the '*') So my question: are there more identifiers like '%s' so that i can edit all 3 variables? (I want to type something like 'tv [time] [sender] [genre]' ------- End Quote -------- It would also be useful for currency conversion websites. I would suggest that the bookmark should be able to store %s, %s1, %s2, %s3 and so on, and that a specific character is used to differentiate between them in the location bar, such as ~ or something which is generally not searched for.

I explain about Mozilla and show them all it does, and they run home excited. Then, they're very, very turned off by the number of steps required to actually bring Mozilla to my level of functionality - downloading and installing the browser, downloading, installing, and switching themes, downloading as many as 10 plugins, and configuring many of them in a very tedious process. There ought to be away I can take my configuration - my plugin settings, theme, everything - and tie it into one download, simply. This seems to me to require 2 efforts: 1) Create an Export Plugins/Themes Settings dialog, which when called lets you select which plugin and theme selections and settings you want exported, then writes out some XML to a single file. The XML would be packaged into a "myPlugins.zip" file (or some new extension), zipping up the XML file and all related plugin config files. 2) Create some way of Importing these Settings. Ideally the XML file could be packaged with a Mozilla/Firefox installer somehow. To keep things simple, a first step would be to simply have a Plugins/Themes Settings Import dialog, that the user could access after installing the base product. The XML format would have to list the plugin name and URL of each plugin/theme. It should be obvious this will have additional configuration backup/transfer benefits to a single user with multiple computers or frequent installs. This functionality could drastically benefit Firefox evangelism if Firefox is meant to be so light in its base install. Reproducible: Didn't try Steps to Reproduce:</description>

(not trivial because of different data types error checking) BackGround I always turn off a lot of dom options... (switch disable from false to true) to keep stupid web pages from resizing my web browser, or hiding the address bar... anyway, I also do this ritual on all of my friends computers, because I refuse to use Internet Explorer, and I show them the cool features of FireFox... and they mostly don't care that I did a lot of work to get it all customized for them, and installed all the plugins for them... but that is besides the point... They do use the browser occasionally, and this feature would make it easier for me to install FireFox on more computers. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3. This is probably an extremely low priority task, because it seems like it would be hard to do, with few people who want to do it... another solution to my problem (proabably the right way) would be to make the roaming profile support more rhobust and copyable so that I could just download my config WITHOUT my personal data in it to their machines. I am so looking forwards to developer.mozilla.org I haven't figured out how to do much yet...</description>

      <title>Easy download of EMBEDded media via null plugin</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7b) Gecko/20040304 Firefox/0.8.0+ (BlueFyre) Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7b) Gecko/20040304 Firefox/0.8.0+ (BlueFyre) I think it would be awesome if disabling a plugin also caused files of that type to be downloaded instead of being displayed with the plugin when the EMBED tag is used. For example, you could go to quicktime.com and download the movie trailers easily instead of mucking through the HTML with View Source to find the URLs (with automatic downloading to the desktop this would be even more awesome). Once they're downloaded you could watch them in fullscreen mode, or save them for later, or whatever. Embedded video players always suck. If nobody else likes this idea, then at least the UI for disabling plugins should be changed to explain more clearly that so-called "disabled" plugins are often still used. A further improvement to Firefox's plugin handling would be to enhance the "click here to get the plugin" placeholder with a way to download the file that would otherwise be displayed by the plugin. That way you wouldn't even need a browser plugin if you already had an application that could read the file. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce:</description>

      <title>Allow bookmark keyword searches from the search bar / integrate toolbar and bookmark keyword searches</title>

I'm thinking maybe this is against the design philosophy of firefox. Shouldn't there be only one way of adding "quick" searches, or at least a common backend for the two mechnisms? In terms of functionality, I would at least want closer integration between "search engines" and "keywords" quick search, so that I could do: 1. Somehow access the "keyword" bookmarks via the search field instead of the location entry. 2. Access search engines via the location field as if they were "keyword" searches. In particular, I'd really like 1) to be implemented. I find the keyword mechanism somewhat cumbersome to use today because I have to remove the URL text all the time.

      <title>Add Synchonize for Offline Viewing</title>

Bookmarks should have synchronization options to: * allow one-click synchronization (ie, download all bookmarks flagged to be synchronized) * allow scheduled synchronization (ie, download a new copy of all flagged bookmarks every weekday at 6am) * allow synchronization for X links deep from the page (so it would cache all pages within X many links from the page) This feature would be tremendously usable to me and several other people I know. We are college students, and our professors frequently update webpages with examples or extra notes. It is useful to be able to access these in class, but most classrooms do not have internet access. A solution is to use IE6's synchronization features so it downloads a new copy every day at 6am, which we can view offline in the classroom. This feature would add tremendous user-friendliness to Firefox, and would remove the last reason I have to occasionally use Internet Explorer. Please seriously consider its inclusion. It's a fairly natural extension to the Work Offline mode added to 0.8. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce:</description>

      <title>Enable non-href link recognition</title>
      <description>I hope this is the right component; if not please correct. It would be nice if the browser could recognize a URL which isn't a HREF in the HTML source. Often you come across URLs that aren't "active" so you have to select them, copy them, and past them in the location bar. My proposal is that Mozilla would automatically recognize those plain-text URLs when either: - the mouse pointer hovers over one; it could dynamically underline the link in that case - text which is parsable as an URL is selected and right-clicked. The context menu could show an option 'Open in new window/tab' like it does with normal links.</description>

There are already bugs filed to cover these issues: Bug 90213 - Specific mousepointer when hovering mouse over a mailto: link Bug 14027 - Indicate whether a link will open in a new window Bug 169678 - Cursor shape should reflect the type of link hovered on (e.g. pop-up/download/mailto...) (different cursors for links to new windows) However, regular hyperlinks can be opened using the accel and shift keys, and even if the bugs mentioned above are fixed, there will be no visual indication that the accel or shift keys will change the behaviour of clicking on the hyperlink. Proposal: The functionality above should be added to, allowing the cursor to react to the accelerator keys for regular hyperlinks. Ideally, when an accel or shift key is held, the appropriate cursor (new window, new tab &amp; if feasible - new active tab) should be shown when hovering over a hyperlink. If a user is already hovering over a hyperlink and a combination of these keys is pressed, the cursor should change to reflect this. I'm filing this due to the comments by Paradox52525 in the following MozillaZine thread: http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=60795 "It would make the new tab/window hotkeys a bit less crpytic to new users, and IMO anything that provides more user feedback is good (as long as it's not intrusive)."

Next I open a new tab and paste the word and hit control+enter, which will fill http://www. and .com. We have to position the cursor in address bar and press enter. Later I found out that you can customize toolbar with GO button. After that it was easier. Just paste the text and click on GO button with ctrl pressed. GO button should be on by default as it is in case with IE. But than many will say that for google search GO button should be there. I have customized my toolbar with previous, next, refresh, Add tab, print, address bar and go button only. Many users will not come to know about GO button, so it should be on by default.

After the bookmark the created if it is attempted to be used the user will receive an Alert message box stating: ht is not a registered protocol (if using the specific replication instructions below). By including a syntax check for the location input field at the time of entry the user friendliness of the browser could be enhanced. This enhancement would be in the form of reduced user frustration by avoiding after the fact notification requiring the user to return to the Bookmark manager to correct the syntax error. I compared the above-described behavior to that of Internet Explorer version 5.50.4807.2300CO. The design is slightly different, but a similar function (bookmark Properties) within IE with a location input field (URL: in IE) does provide the user a Problem with Shortcut warning message if an address with incorrect syntax is entered into the URL field. Step to replicate Null Entry error message in Internet Explorer: Favorites --&gt; Right Click on any website --&gt; Select Properties --&gt; Switch to the Web Documents tab in the Properties Dialog Box --&gt; Delete the entry in the URL field --&gt; Enter hp://www.anywebsite.com/ --&gt; Click OK Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Bookmarks --&gt; Manage Bookmarks --&gt; New Bookmark 2. On the info tab, in the location field enter: ht://www.anywebsite.com. 3. Click OK on the Properties of “New Bookmark” dialog box.

      <title>Installer should allow override files from it's parent directory</title>
      <description>Historically a Client Customization Kit (CCK) could be used, by ISP's, Universities, and businesses to customize a web browser to their personal needs. Common things to customize are: 1. Bookmarks 2. Preferences 3. Throbber/Throbber URL 4. Homepage 5. Mail Settings How it could work initially: There should be 2 modes. By default, the installer looks in it's parent directory for an override file (custom.js). In this file, it would specify, what files (and where they are located), override what. By simply adding the path to a new user.js file, the installer would automatically override the default user.js file with the one specified. Same for things like bookmarks, and the product name. If the custom.js has the ability to forward (be a mere alias to a temporary directory), it could perhaps point to a server, or a place on the user's hard drive where the real files exist, allowing for more options. Going all out: To take it one step further, allow the Installer to check it's parent directory for the presence of any .xpi or .jar file, and add them to the custom install option (or as a default if referenced in the custom.js file). Thus allowing an organization to offer their favorite theme (or a custom theme), and extension(s). This could effectively replace the need for a CCK by large installations sucha s ISP's and Universities. It provides for a mechanism to easily modify Firefox without needing advanced programming skills. There could even perhaps be a small app to create a custom.js file. Another advantage is that if installers were created for other platforms in the future, itw ould be easy for an ISP to support, since they could drop the same custom.js file, and appropriate files, and the Installer does the magic.</description>

If you resize the browser window to less than the height of the content so that the scrollbar, FireFox automatically adds in the scrollbar which causes the centered document to jump to the left to accomodate the width of the scrollbar. I believe that this should not happen; FireFox should provide a means to reserve space for the scrollbar so that you can disable this behaviour. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.Go to noted link 2.Resize window to less than the height of the content Actual Results: Centered content jumps to the left Expected Results: Centered content should remain where it is This occurs on FireBird 0.7 and FireFox 0.8 build 200040206</description>

JunkBuster and the others work well, but for the average user setting up a local HTTP proxy is too painful. an average user would only have one browser, so integrating the ad filtering into it is okay. and running a proxy 24/7, even if not browsing is wasting resources. the built-in ad fliter would nicely fit with the popup blocking as well!

      <title>Unable to switch to last tabs opened if more than 32 tabs open on a 1024x768 screen.</title>

I propose adding a dropdown list after the 31st tab that would appear perhaps as a chevron » indicating that there were more. While several different Bugzilla entries referring to possible new formats for tabbed browsing- none that I saw mentioned the 32 tab limit. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.Open 32 tabs 2.Open another tab 3.you can't see the 33rd, 34th or following. Expected Results: A Chevron » should have appeared at tab 31 indicating that more tabs could be revealed by clicking on it. Clicking on the chevron would bring a drop down list of any remaining tabs.</description>

      <title>Bookmarks/RSS items should always show tooltip when hovering with mouse</title>
      <description>If you hover the mouse over a bookmark on the Bookmarks Toolbar, you get a tooltip showing the full title and its URI. However, if you hover the mouse over a bookmark inside a folder, or from the Bookmarks menu, you don't see the tooltip. It should always be possible to see the tooltip, as in IE. It's faster than right-clicking and selecting Properties just to verify the URI.</description>

When entering full-screen mode (e.g. using F11), Firefox hides any and all access to the Windows start-menu bar. Optimally, the start menu bar would go into auto-hide (this can be seen in IE 6), and potentially it would be nice to have a 'make start bar always visible' option. Given the truncated window decorations anyway, full screen is still much more friendly on real estate. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Enter full screen mode. 2. Move the cursor to the bottom of the screen. Actual Results: No amount of delay activates the start menu. Expected Results: Raise the menu bar from hidden status.</description>

      <title>request for transparent handling of accepted languages</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7b) Gecko/20040318 Firefox/0.8.0+ Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7b) Gecko/20040318 Firefox/0.8.0+ In Windows Linux and OSX, it is possible to set 'regional settings', which tell your system date and time formats, as well as keyboard layouts. In Windows for example, users use the 'Regional Settings' option in the Control Panel. When a user browses to a website which does automatic translation, or alternatively displays content intended on a country-by-country basis, the browser's HTTP_LANGUAGE_ACCEPT header is sent with the request for the page. This variable is then used by some webservers to decide which language to send the resulting web page. Internet Explorer's HTTP_LANGUAGE_ACCEPT variable (which for me is set to en-gb) is governed by the OS setting. It is transparently set: there is no separate user preference in Internet Explorer (and, nor should there be). This, to me, is how Firefox should operate too: it's entirely transparent and intuitive. In short: A request for Firefox's HTTP_LANGUAGE_ACCEPT variable to be set automatically by examining the user's locale settings, present in Windows, Linux and OSX. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: In Windows 2000: 1. In Control Panel, choose "United Kingdom" in the 'Regional Settings' page. 2. Visit http://www.delorie.com:81/some/url.html using MSIE. 3. You should see that the HTTP_LANGUAGE_ACCEPT variable is "en-gb" 4. Visit the same page using Firefox. 5. You should see that the HTTP_LANGUAGE_ACCEPT variable is "en-us" Actual Results: Detailed above Expected Results: Detailed above I am aware there is a plugin to allow users to change the language accept. This is counter-intuitive when the user has already set this for his/her OS.</description>

It's more convenient to have a single history window that doesn't take up screen real estate than having to open the history in whichever window I'm currently browsing. I like the CTRL-B and CTRL-H features of Mozilla and would like that carried over. I know bug 178199 discusses CTRL-B (WONTFIX but perhaps CTRL-SHIFT-B) in particular but I'm talking about depending on the side bar at all. I really hate sidebars and would want to be able to disable them in place of these windows before I would migrate to Firefox. Since the roadmap is now to focus on the standalone apps with "a conservative, sustaining engineering fashion" type of support for Mozilla/SeaMonkey, I think a "SeaMonkey Parity" of some form should be established.

Okay, you want to use another search word and reverse the direction... oops that dialog is on the way - Click it. IMPROVEMENT THe extra dialog to announce the error condition is not strictly necessary. Firefox could use the tab's status bar (at the bottom) to announce that there are no (more) matches and keep the Open dialog visible. This would remove the extra step to force to close the error dialog. Especially if it is needed to type several words before correct place is found, it is unconvenient to be have to close the "error dialog" all the time. For novices this is fine. But offer for experienced users an option to use status br indication instead. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: I fill out a web form many times. One field contains a calendar that is repeated several times. Then it changes to a different date, again repeated several times. Actual Results: Because all dates start with the same character sequence, the selection list becomes longer and longer. After a number of entries, it is easier to type the complete string every time than to search it in the selection list. Expected Results: It would be helpful for me if I could right-click on the input field and delete the input list saved for this specific field. For other cases, an option to delete the autocompletion information for one complete form may be desired.</description>

This would be esp. helpful with a product like Firefox where distributors are not yet providing thier own binary packages (where they often compile against GTK2 for new releases.)

      <title>Image manager should have an "Add site" button</title>
      <description>The image manager should have an "Add site..." button to make it possible to block images you can't block by right-clicking. (You can't block background images, like on abc.go.com, and you can't block the not-rolled-over image of a rollover pair, like on cnet.com. See bug 238293. You can determine which host to block by looking at the page source or the Media tab of Page Info.) Having an "Add site..." button would also improve consistency between pop-up blocking and image blocking, although pop-ups are blocked by default and images are not.</description>

      <title>Middle-clicking the home page button should open it in a new tab</title>
      <description>I often need to open my home page in a new tab and so instinctively middle click the home page button on the navigation toolbar. This unfortunately doesn't work. Given that middle-clicking practically anything else that functions as a link does open it in a tab (anchors, bookmarks etc), this is an inconsistency in the UI. To reproduce: - Middle-click the home page button in the nav toolbar Expected: - My home page should open in a new tab (including opening about:blank in a new tab if that is what my home page is set to) Actual: - Nothing happens</description>

Please make it possible for the user to say YES or NO at the Import Bookmars dialog before starting to import bookmarks.

If I visit the item, that is the only way to see URL. Also, I can drag-and-drop the item, or do a right-click and copy. Then in a different application I could see the URL. It would be better to have a way to display the URL string directly in the browser. Expected Results: Would like some way to see URL and time visited.</description>

      <title>IE6-like cookie management</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040216 Firefox/0.8 (Nova-0.8-W32: MNG,DOMi) Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040216 Firefox/0.8 (Nova-0.8-W32: MNG,DOMi) To exercise some control over cookies in Firefox, users like me enable the "Enable Cookies" and "but ask before accepting" perfs. This pops up a dialog every time a site asks for a cookie. A user can deny the request but some site asks for multiple cookies and is very annoying. In such case a user can check the box on the dialog and add the site to the accept/deny list. However, denying cookie may break some sites. There is also no visual feedback when a site is denied a cookie due to it being in the deny list, which the user may have entered it into months ago and forgotten about. If the user added the site to the deny list by mistake he/she'll have to go 2 levels down from Tool-&gt;options, look for the site in the list and remove it. This is made more troublesome by the fact that you can't do a search on the accept/deny lists. IE6 in this respect is much more easy to use; an icon is displayed on the status bar whenever a cookie is accepted or denied due to the default policy, and the user do not need to confirm anything. The user gets visual feedback that a cookie is used/deny, and if he wants to make an exception for the site, he can click on the icon which brings up a dialog to add/remove the site from the exception list. Similar technique is used in FireFox for site management for pop-up blocking. It would be more consistent and easier for the user to do cookie blocking management the same way. To reiterate, I think it is desirable to - Have visual feedback when a cookie is used/denied. - Make it so that the user is prompted only when he/she wants to make an exception, not every time. - Make editing the exception list a single click on the icon, not 2 levels down the perfs.

When a user wants has two or more pages open, but wants to use only the active page for the homepage, there isn't any. The use current pages button will set the homepage for all pages open, but there should be a button just for the active tab. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: A button to the left of the Use current pages would be okay, but if it's too much, then one can bring up a message box when one clicks the "Use current pages" to ask if only the active page should be used. Besides, what is the likelyhood that users would want to have more than one page open every time Firefox is started?</description>

This seems sort of stupid. I run my computer in a 1680x1050 resolution (widescreen baby) and there's a ton of wasted space below the information in the sidebar. Even in lower resolutions this is noticeable. Wouldn't it make more sense to be able to have multiple panes of information in the sidebar? For example, I use the Download Manager Tweak extension, and put my download manager in the sidebar. I usually keep my bookmarks there (widescreen gives me some extra space on the side) and they go away when the download manager pops up. This seems unnecessary. I'd love to have my bookmarks AND my download manager over there, along with anything else I decide to add later. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open something in the sidebar. 2. Open something else in the sidebar. 3. First thing goes away! Actual Results: Thuroughly explained in "Steps to Reproduce." Not too complicated. Expected Results: 1. Open something in the sidebar. 2.

Many web designers, for whatever reason, do not correctly implement character encoding on the server. If I'm not mistaken, IE can automatically detect the correct encoding so they don't see the need for doing this. Secondly, companies have the need either to restrict users from the pull down menus, or simply need to provide more real estate for their apps. Therefore, we, users, cannot change the encoding to reflect the desired language. IE does implement this feature through right-clicking as well, so there is no problem in the IE land. Not exactly the case in the Mozilla based browsers. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

The auto-completion in Firefox's location bar is far from usable most of the time. For example, if I have visited www.endless-fantasy.de, and browsed around the page a lot, the next time I open Firefox, it will show all kinds of "sub-URLs" from that page as soon as I enter "endl", but the MOST IMPORTANT link - the index page (just www.endless-fantasy.de) is lost somewhere in the middle of the stack of URLs, and one has to scroll down through dozens of entries to find it. It's much quicker to just type the whole URL by hand then :) It should definitely auto-complete the most top-level URL by default. Reproducible: Sometimes Steps to Reproduce: See above! Actual Results: :) Expected Results: :) :)</description>

      <title>Feature request: option to always open in same tab</title>

This can be remedied by using the 'middle mouse button to open in a new tab' option, but when you want to replace the current tab with the link (as normal links do), you will get a new window, which is not what I want. Therefore I would like an option to force opening this link in the same tab, instead of opening a new window for it. It's ok if javascript popups still popup, if allowed by the other options. In other words, this feature shouldn't affect javascript popups. The justification for including this feature would be that opening in a new window isn't necessary if you use tabs. If this isn't enough justification, I would like an option to open in a new tab if the link says to open in a new window. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Go to a website where a link opens a new window instead of in the current window 2. Click the abovementioned link (left mouse button) 3. Get annoyed by the fact that it is opened in a new window, instead of in the same tab Actual Results: A new window was created and the link was opened therein. Expected Results: The link should have opened in the active tab, or if that's not feasible, open in a new tab (of course only if the corresponding option is turned on). I think this is the only feature I'm missing in a lot of browsers :-)</description>

      <title>Make "Find in this Page" start from the beginning of the document (as a default).</title>

I propose changing "Find in this Page" so that is starts searching at the beginning of the document, and, if necessary, make searching where the user clicks an option in the dialog. 1) If a user is looking to find something on the page, which he often is, then by not starting at the beginning, the user does not know if the search has covered the entire page. Instead, he must first scroll to the top, click on the top of the page, and then do the search to be sure everything is covered. Or, he must search one time using down, and then click the up radio option and search a second time to be 100% sure the entire page has been covered. This process makes something very simple, much more tedious than it needs to be. 2) The "Find in this Page" does not indicate that the search begins where the user clicks the mouse. Most people migrating from IE (which is the majority of people) will expect it to search the entire page, and may be oblivious for some time to the fact that their searches are not doing what they want. Solution 1: Switch back to the method where it begins searching at the top of the page. Find as you type could then be used to begin searching at a certain point. The only downside to this, is that people might not like find as you type and/or there may be instances where find as you type doesn't fit what the user needs. Solution 2: Switch back to the method where it begins searching at the top of the page, and make this the default. However, include an option to "begin searching where the user clicked." The only downside to this is the UI clutter it could cause if, and when, Bug 234048 is implemented. Other solutions? If we need to collect some user feedback on this issue, I think we could take some time to do that as well. However, I do feel that this is a significant issue (especially for people migrating to Firefox) that needs to be addressed in some way. Note, I will attach some screenshots....

This is very useful, but it would be even better if you providing the choice of saving all open sites, or all open sites in a given window to a bookmark (or bookmark-equivalent). For example, I like to check out a number of different webcomics every day. It would be wonderful to be able to open these 6-7 webcomics in separate tabs then save a 'bookmark' called 'daily webcomics' (or whatever). When clicked, the 'bookmark' would automatically open a new Firefox window, and reload each of the 6-7 sites into a separate tab. You could then also surpass Galeon-style 'save on exit' functionality by just automatically saving a 'bookmark' of all open sites upon exit under a standard name.

There have long existed a patch for Linux, which have been incorporated in the official Debian packages since Firebird 0.6 without problems, and have as such got a lot of testing. The patch has lately been both reviewed and superreviewed by bryner and roc respectively, and was committed to the trunk tonight. It will be a pity to have both Firefox 0.9 and 1.0 without this feature, even though I know it is late.

      <title>Would like to import settings from other installs of firefox.</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8a) Gecko/20040416 Firefox/0.8.0+ Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8a) Gecko/20040416 Firefox/0.8.0+ (2004-04-16) I have approximatly 3 builds of Firefox on my machine at any one time. I generally have the latest nightly, an older 'extensionized' nightly, and the stable build. I wish to import the settings from my 'extensionized' nightly into the newly downloaded nightly. Very unimportanat, but it would be nice. It'd make it easier to do testing/QA. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: A scenario for the normal user: 1. Have a currently installed version of Firefox. 2. Download new version (some new stable release or something like that) 3. Want to uninstall and get settings from old firefox. 4. Try to import but find no setting to import from Firefox. For me: 1. I like testing the nightlies. I generally download the new nightly zip and move it to an alternate install like 'G:\Program Files\Firefox\'. 2. I change my shortcuts in start menu and elsewhere to point to the new firefox. 3. I run firefox Actual Results: It only imports from one or the other of the installs listed in 'expected results'. Apparently random which one it imports. I believe it imports from the last one I opened. Expected Results: I expect it to import the settings (specifically bookmarks) from the last nightly that I downloaded (installed in something like 'G:\Program Files\Mozilla_Firefox') and the stable build (installed in the default 'G:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox'). I would love to see an addition to the import dialog to import from a previous install of firefox. I believe this'd be useful not just for testers like me, but for the casual user as described above. Was this clear? Do you need more explanation? Thanks, Jacob Floyd aka TechGuruFloyd</description>

      <title>PHP files not accepted without MimeType, disabling WebDev tool preview in browser.</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8a) Gecko/20040416 Firefox/0.8.0+ Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8a) Gecko/20040416 Firefox/0.8.0+ Summary: I understand that in handling files Firefox checks the MIME type sent by the server (which is to be expected, of course), and that if the MIME type is not recognized, and it isn’t in some manner of pre-configured list of types to render regardless (e.g. JPG, GIF, HTML), the program gives you two choices: 1) save to disc, 2) open with default application. Problem: I use Macromedia Dreamweaver to develop Web pages in various Internet languages including PHP. When I try to preview in Firefox, something that is quite important for developers trying to make sure their sites are fully supported in Mozilla and company without extra stress, I am presented with the dialogue box and given no option to view the file. Solution: Given the nature of this issue I would like to propose that PHP (along with other obvious Internet languages like ASP perhaps if they are not included) be added to the list of file types to render whenever Firefox encounters them even without a proper MIME type. This would allow people who code their sites in various tools that have preview options to use Firefox (and perhaps Mozilla too) in previewing these files. Problems: I don’t see any myself. Some might wonder if this would ever lead to problems, but I can’t imagine why. Can you really think of many cases in which a PHP file being sent to Firefox/Mozilla would be for anything other than the program actually rendering them? I suspect this might also have something to do with many download scripts on the Internet failing as well. I realize that local PHP script will contain elements Firefox won’t be able to render, but given the circumstances under which this will take place I definitely think a change should be made. And if the later is involved (download scripts not working) it would be a change that would improve usability for people who aren’t geeks—the sort that don’t like to use browsers that put them in cryptic unexpected situations. Also, if denied, it would be very wonderful if some configuration or preference option (even in about:config) could be added for geeks like Web designers who would like to see this functionality, making FireFox and company work as expected and also making it easier to develop for these browsers. Additional suggestion: The dialogue box presented in this situation should be given a third option; “Open with FireFox,” just in case the person using the browser wants to do just that. This might help to ease problems for file types that the user might not actually want to preview in Mozilla. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Create PHP file in Dreamweaver 2. Attempt to preview in FireFox. Actual Results: Presented with a dialogue asking if I wish to 1) save to disc, or 2) open with 'default application' (which ironically is the very one I sent the preview from). Expected Results: FireFox should have rendered the file. If not that, the dialogue box should certainly have offered an option to open with FireFox (and while this would be a good feature to add, in my opinion, it doesn’t truly solve the concern above given the annoyance of dealing with the extra step).</description>

      <title>Open external applications by looking at the suffix</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8 I think this is Mac-specific. I would like a preference where you can set Firefox to open an external application with the AppleEvent URLEvent (or whatever it is called) if either the file type (MIME type) or the suffix matches something. Examples on when this would be useful is for mov, ics, rss, dmg, pdf, vcf etc. *ics* Even though ics just is text/plain (?) there is not much point in viewing it in the browser. It would be much better if I could set iCal (or Mozilla;-) to open it than either just viewing the raw source in a browser window or clutter my download folder with calender-files. You can manually try this if you find an ics-file somewhere and change the protocol from http:// to webcal://. If you haven't changed anything in your system the address/download is handed over to iCal *vcf* Very much like ics, plain text but no point in viewing it in a browser or downloading it to the download folder and then manually add it to the address book (which leaves the original file untouched leading to a cluttered download folder). If you change http to addressbook Address Book.app opens the vcf. *rss* Similar to ics and vcf. *pdf, mov, dmg* There are programs that handles all of these filetypes directly; Acrobat, Quicktime Player and Disk Mounting Utility (name?) all accepts the URLEvent. At the moment I manipulate the html source with privoxy but it does not work all the time (specifically it only works when the link to the vcf, ics or dmg is absolute), therefore I think this should be integrated in the browser. Maybe the problem is that people use http for files that would do much better with a different protocol (like webcal) but as long as we live in an imperfect world... I understand that some people want to download all files and then manually take care of them, that is the reason I think it should be a preference. Something like: For files of the type/with the suffix text/pdf send the URL to external application: Acrobat .vcf send the URL to external application Address Book.app At the moment you can only decide which actions should apply depending on the file type (MIME type) and you have no option to hand over the URL, just download or view with a plug-in.

      <title>seporate config and other files :: profile preference folder has mixed personal, and configuration data</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Konqueror/3.2; Linux; X11; i686; en_US) (KHTML, like Gecko) Build Identifier: any firefox, and I guess mozilla might have similar profile management I just want to have a directory that contains world readable config information about my browser, and one that is private ~/firefox/profiles/Default/ao;fsdkasg/shareableconfig and ~/firefox/profiles/Default/ao;fsdkasg/confidentail ~/firefox/profiles/Default/ao;fsdkasg/conditionallyshared/bookmarks.htm or something like that... I want to just be able to copy a users "layout" directory and have it be the default one for the system. I don't want to have to try every file combination to find the minimal set that contains the browser/toolbar layout, the extentions I want, a default set of bookmarks... all without having an accidental copying of my password database. I spent about a week trying to figure out how to apply my firefox settings to everyone on my computer. It wasn't that hard, except for not knowing what preference files to copy, and what ones contain, say my cookies or some sort of cache.. I wanted to have my exact layout copied for all of my users. I went through a lot of ~/.firefox directories and Application Data/Firefox directories, because I had to copy systematically my config files in different combinations to the defaults/profile/US folder, then start a browser, and have it not work, then try again by deleting the firefoxconfig directory, copying another config file over to the default folder, (oh there was an su in there too, or a switch to a different xterm) and then trying again. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3. Actual Results: Lots of trial and error, or lazy copy everything, and share passwords and other private information with people. Expected Results: easy to clone configs and preferences safely (without copying sensitive data to everyone)</description>

The next time I'll open Firefox the toolbars are open and after few (3?) seconds they hide scrolling with a transition under the window heading, exactly as does the MacOsX Dock. 5. When I move the mouse cursor near or on the window heading the toolbars appear with an inverse transition. Then I can move the mouse on the toolbar and interact with it. 6. When I move the cursor outside the toolbars the toolbars disappear again as at step 4. (You can test if creating an invisible area of 10 pixels from the bottom may be more functional) 7. If I have not selected an input form and I start writing more than one letter with the keyboard (1 key is useful for keyboard navigation) the toolbars appear and the word writing in the navigation toolbar.</description>

      <title>Fix IE profile migration to work with free MS VC toolkit</title>
      <description>Over on Mozillazine a few people have gotten Firefox to build using *only* free tools while still achieving binary compatibility through use of the free MS VC++ toolkit. Building requires a manual patch, however to disable IE profile migration (it horks the build). It would be nice if this could be somehow fixed so that building using a free setup is possible without requiring source tree hacks. The patch mentioned in the forums is a hack specifically for the situation/toolset and can't be used in the tree. Here's the error text of the error encountered by one builder: Creating library firefox.lib and object firefox.exp brwsrcmp.lib(nsIEProfileMigrator.obj) : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbo l "void __stdcall _com_issue_error(long)" (?_com_issue_error@@YGXJ@Z) referenced in function "public: __thiscall _bstr_t::Data_t::Data_t(unsigned short const *) " (??0Data_t@_bstr_t@@QAE@PBG@Z) brwsrcmp.lib(nsIEProfileMigrator.obj) : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbo l "char * __stdcall _com_util::ConvertBSTRToString(unsigned short *)" (?ConvertB STRToString@_com_util@@YGPADPAG@Z) referenced in function "public: char const * __thiscall _bstr_t::Data_t::GetString(void)const " (?GetString@Data_t@_bstr_t@@Q BEPBDXZ) brwsrcmp.lib(nsIEProfileMigrator.obj) : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbo l "void __stdcall _com_issue_errorex(long,struct IUnknown *,struct _GUID const &amp; )" (?_com_issue_errorex@@YGXJPAUIUnknown@@ABU_GUID@@@Z) referenced in function " public: long __thiscall PSTORECLib::IPStore::ReadItem(unsigned long,struct _GUID *,struct _GUID *,unsigned short *,unsigned long *,unsigned char * *,struct PSTO RECLib::_PST_PROMPTINFO *,unsigned long)" (?ReadItem@IPStore@PSTORECLib@@QAEJKPA U_GUID@@0PAGPAKPAPAEPAU_PST_PROMPTINFO@2@K@Z) firefox.exe : fatal error LNK1120: 3 unresolved externals make[4]: *** [firefox.exe] Error 96 make[4]: Leaving directory `/cygdrive/c/mozilla/browser/app' make[3]: *** [libs] Error 2 make[3]: Leaving directory `/cygdrive/c/mozilla/browser' make[2]: *** [tier_99] Error 2 make[2]: Leaving directory `/cygdrive/c/mozilla' make[1]: *** [default] Error 2 make[1]: Leaving directory `/cygdrive/c/mozilla' make: *** [build] Error 2</description>

      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.7b) Gecko/20040415 Firefox/0.8.0+ Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.7b) Gecko/20040415 Firefox/0.8.0+ I have looked around and there is no way to change the default character encoding used for viewing pages, from the UI. Some sites, such as Google, seem to take the user prefered encoding (sent out with request, I believe) and then send back the pages encoded in that format. Since my browser default to ISO-8859-1, it means thay any search results containing non-roman characters aren't displayed correctly. It would be nice to be able to change the default encoding - this is possible with Mozilla. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

I believe it would be clearer if it read 'Copy Link Address' as it is the address which is being copied not the location.

      <title>UI for multiple preferences missing and can only be changed in pref .js files</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8 I had been listening to a CD earlier with headphones on (volume turned up) and still had them on when I accidentally started typing while foxfire had focus and invoked type ahead find and was very startled by the loud noise (Link not found audio notification). I didn't know that this feature existed and was very thrilled find out. However, I didn't want the audio notification and I discovered with some work that the only way to turn this off appears to be in the all.js preference file as the UI only has options for turning find as you type on and off and rather or not you wish it to be restricted to just links. While researching this bug, it appears that there are many options that I would expect users to want to change (perhaps under an "advanced" type of option) without having to spend an hour researching it and then editing the .js file(s). I will try to list all the related bugs that I could find on this. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: N/A Expected Results: The preferences UI should be extended. I propose the possibility of a "More Options" button on the Advanced Tab that toggles to "Less Options" and then displaying the "double advanced" options in a slightly different color. The "More Options" under advanced should display all options that can now be edited in the .js files (not sure about how that will fit into the theme .js settings) and not having "More Options" on will cause the Advanced tab to display the more common advanced options that users would expect to keep it from becoming too god dam hard to find what you want like IE is now.

      <title>Change deletion of autocomplete entries from shift+del  to just del button</title>
      <description>Now that bug 204706 has been fixed you dont run into the problem described in bug 171605 comment 24 where just pressing delete would delete what you typed in + the autocomplete entry. Just pressing the delete button to delete an autocomplete entry is something that even my 67 (from today, yiha) old father figured out in IE. It would make it easier for IE users that switch to just have the delete button as IE has it. Steps to reproduce 1. Let a IE user try to delete an autocomplete entry 2. See how he confused he gets when he presses delete and nothing happends 3. Explain that shift + delete was decided for the reason that bug 204706 was not fixed yet Actual results: IE user looks completely confused when I start explaining what bugzilla bug number 204706 is. Expected results: Too see IE user switching to Firefox happy and not confused when he presses delete for an autocomplete entry.</description>

      <title>Transparent slider would be a great addition to the toolbar</title>

Often I find myself tabbing between windows as I unfortunately don't have a 20" LCD. I think it would be a great feature to have an "always on top" flag that can be set in conjunction with a transparent slider in the toolbar. this would allow me to layer windows and still work in a development environment while having my reference overlayed, yet not the focused window. Reproducible: Sometimes Steps to Reproduce: 1. Transparent slider toolbar should be a checkable option in the View --&gt; Toolbars menu 2. The "always on top" could also be on the transparent slider toolbar, as well as in the General section of the Options menu. 3. I must admit this idea was inspired by the layering feature demoed by Sun in a recent R&amp;D presentation of a 3D desktop. Thanks for the great product!</description>

      <title>Introduce a way to record actions and play them back</title>
      <description>I would like the browser to record surfing actions and them allow to play them back. That would ease certain things and definitively one more killer feature for the browser. Type of actions possible: - auto-login on sites where I have an account. The action would record which account was selected. - auto-downloading of a file, maybe selecting the mirror, accepting the license (something really cool would be to check if the license has changed, but that's a different issue) - ...? I foresee that this could be comletely outside the browser, made as extension which could record any kind of action. Could be used for example to modify a preference in about:config automatically, etc... A standalone version of the tool would finally also be used to test the mozilla tools, as a GUI test tool. Other remarks: - Maybe some server side info is required for some actions, and maybe a W3C spec is required? - Could this be a security problem?</description>

      <description>There are occasions when it is nice to have Microsoft Internet Explorer's behavior -- you open a new tab, and it places the current page (and optionally the history) into the new tab. Adding an option for this offers the best of both worlds: users can have that behavior, but only when they want it.</description>

      <title>Idea for unifying the location/address bar and search bar while improving functionality</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8 The basic idea of this interface change/enhancement is to allow searches easily and logically for users of any level of technical skill from the location/address bar, doing away entirely with the need for a separate search bar. The idea is not to make it more awkward for advanced users, in fact I believe it is actually simpler and faster still. The basic design I am suggesting is as follows. This replaces both the current location bar and search bar. &lt;icon&gt;[address or search term]&lt;go&gt;&lt;search&gt;&lt;icon&gt; KEY: The first &lt;icon&gt; represents the favicon, just as it does now The text in [ ] represents the location (now also search) bar where you type &lt;go&gt; This is a small go button. Lots of users will not use this, but _many_ less advanced users (which Firefox will start to encounter more of) will simply not know what to do otherwise. My parents are prime examples. &lt;search&gt;This button would search using the current search engine. Rather than just saying "Search" it should in my opinion also name the currently selected search engine (e.g. "Google Groups" or "Google UK") underneath the word "Search" (or perhaps something like "Search for this on"). This second line of text would change when the search engine is changed. It is _critical_ that this button have a tooltip (or something) pointing out the keyboard shortcut for web search (see below) from the location/search bar. &lt;icon&gt;This is the icon representing the search engine (e.g. the G icon for google, the Y icon for yahoo etc) which you would click on to select the search engine (as it is now, but without the search bar on the right). When shifting between multiple search engines with the same icon (e.g. google uk, groups, etc) you have the added benefit that the search button also gives the name of the current engine. Essentially, you get a a cleanup of the GUI and the cutdown in complication by having to use a keyboard shortcut to jump to a search and back again. You press enter for an address (and less advanced users have the comfort of a tiny 'go' button), and you use the keyboard shortcut (now in the nightly builds) for web search to do the search. This is the same as clicking on the search button. Now there is a shortcut for web search put into the nightly builds, this is obviously going to be the shortcut of choice for most advanced users. It's quicker that having to jump to the search box first. As for the less advanced, I am certain that most of them will feel more comfortable clicking a 'Search' button than having to click to the search box (plus the particularly less IT-literate may not know what to do without a search button to click). As a last note, I don't feel that this will take up more toolbar real-estate, in fact it may well increase the area available to the location bar, while allowing longer searches to fit entirely on-screen. Please consider this request for enhancement. I feel it would be a great addition to Firefox 1.0 Ian 'Reve' Macfarlane Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce:</description>

Many of the web pages I bookmark and store on the Links/Bookmarks Toolbar either do not have favicons or use poor icons. Consequently, I frequently change the icon to point to the plentiful and useful icons stored in C:\WINDOWS\system32\shell32.dll or use another icon I have stored on my hard drive. Not only do I use this feature to quickly the Link/Bookmark I want, but it's also a feature I'd like to offer to the users I support at work. (Basically, I hope to create a common Bookmark Toolbar--with custom icons--that I can deploy on all of our computers.) Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Right-click on a bookmark and select Properties Actual Results: There is no option to change the bookmark's icon, especially to one stored in a DLL. Select the file: C:\WINDOWS\system32\shell32.dll Expected Results: This shows the desired functionality: In IE 6, right-click on a bookmark or link and select Properties. Click the Change Icon button.</description>

This is the only feature with Firefox that REALLY bugs me as I now tend to just type goo and let the autocomplete send me to Google instead of using the new search tool bar field. I believe the field is too small and aside from cutting down on my address bar real estate my searches usually consist of quite a few words that I use variations of over and over, and I like to see as I m typing (which is possible using the autocomplete in the address bar, but not in the little search field now). I know a lot of people like having the extra field to type in and I ve done informal surveys here at work where most Lemmings use IE and popup blockers and other such garbage even though something as great as Firefox solves all their needs. I found a mix of (those using Mozilla and Firefox) preferences in search functionality that clearly indicates I m not alone in my view. In this instance I think rather than blazing a trail with new and better functionality you have given in and done what all the other add-on search toolbars do in providing this new exclusive field to type in. So I plead, please let the user select. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: n/a Actual Results: n/a Expected Results: n/a</description>

Actually, it's not even possible to open History in a new window in Firefox, as far as I can tell. I wish that were possible and I wish that there were a preference to open History and Bookmarks in new windows instead of sidebars. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce:</description>

      <title>I wish that copied URL field text was unstyled in the Mac system clipboard</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8a) Gecko/20040506 Firefox/0.8.0+ Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8a) Gecko/20040506 Firefox/0.8.0+ When you select text in the URL bar field and copy it, it is put into the Mac system clipboard as styled text, e.g. with font family and size stored. I wish that it was copied as plain text. I often copy an URL and then paste it into a text document in another application (like TextEdit, M$ Word, FirstClass Client, etc.), and it's always annoying the way that the text gets pasted with styled font and size, pretty much always different than whatever was in use in the text document that I was working on. The workaround is annoying, I have to go and paste it into a plain text editor like BBEdit, then copy that, and then paste that into the other app's document. I see no reason why anyone would ever want the URL bar's text style preserved in the clipboard, so I think that this would be a nice change to make. This might seem very trivial, but really, it's something that gets in my way several times a day, I genuinely find it quite a nuisance. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Copy text from the URL bar field. 2. Paste it into a TextEdit document. Actual Results: The text is pasted styled. Expected Results: I wish it was pasted without style info.</description>

      <title>Size of search toolbar should be customizable (preferably WYSIWYG)</title>

Anyhow, I run mozilla at a res of 1600x1200. Consequently the URL toolbar is very large, which is useful, yes. However the search (google) toolbar is still tiny. I find it very frustrating not being able to adjust the size of this. It would be really nice if I could. The way Apple do it in Safari is there is an adjustment thing between the URL bar and the search bar, you can just click and drag this left or right to adjust the size on the fly. This would be preferable to some sort of config as sometimes you want it large when doing a complex google query. Thanks very much! Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: not applicable. Actual Results: Can't resize search text entry. Expected Results: Resizable text entry.</description>

      <title>RFE: remember pages last visited</title>
      <description>This is a feature I miss most from Mozilla - Firefox should be able to remember which pages were open last time and reload them on startup. Currently, I have to workaround this limitation by setting the homepage to the "Current page" which fortunately also keeps all tabs' URLs, but that's a bit awkward... Please consider this feature for 0.9 if you can - else, Firefox is my standard browser on Win, Linux and BeOS now - thanks a lot for this browser-beast! :) (configurable search-plugins rule my world!;)</description>

Firefox should also have a Fonts pane in Options - fonts are just as important on the web as in emails, if not moreso. The Fonts pane could just contain the content of the current pop-out dialogue. If/when language UI is added, it could go here too (Tb has character encoding in its Fonts pane - it's not much of a stretch). The artwork for the pane's icon can simply be embezzled from Thunderbird. This will increase consistency between Fx and Tb. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8 Build Identifier: Firefox/0.8 the only reason that I still use IE sometimes is the google toolbar. It is very nice to have the search words that match in the page be highlighted and be findable through a find-next button for each search word. This makes locking at search results much more efficient. Especially for large pages. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. open IE with google tolbar installed 2. search for "google search result highlight" 3. click on first hit 4. see marked up page and 4 clickable buttons on toolbar 5. try same in Firebird, but fail :( Actual Results: no marked up page and no clickable buttons on toolbar Expected Results: see marked up page and 4 clickable buttons somewhere (maybe on title bar, there is usually unused space)</description>

I personally think it's a good thing for the mozilla community to include this parameter in the default quick search. Maybe make it firefox-search instead of mozilla-search. I know it's just a small thing, but this might give a clearer picture of the amount of people actually using mozilla / firefox Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open a new tab 2. Type in the adressbar: "google foo" 3. Now click in the small search box to the right, enter "foo" and hit enter Actual Results: when using the location bar, the sourceid parameter is not passed to google Expected Results: Pass it</description>

Firefox (and since Phoenix) does not allow one to permanently ignore plugins of a certain type. I don't want flash on this system. When I visit a page with flash functionality (e.g. http://www.lemond.fr), firefox pops open a dialog that states: ****************************************************************************** This page contains information of a type (application/x-shockwave-flash) that can only be viewed with the appropriate Plug-in. Click OK to download Plugin [CANCEL] [OK] ********************************************************************************* so I spend a lot of my time clicking on these [CANCEL] boxes. I would like the preferences to remember that I never want to deal with flash so I can avoid these popups. This has been bugging me for a long time but I figured you had more important issues. Firefox is now so fantastic that I'm willing to burden you with this enhancement request. thanks again for your great work, adrian Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Remove any flash plugin 2. Restart firefox 3. Visit http://www.lemonde.fr =&gt; a dialog will pop-up There is no way to prevent this dialog from opening by telling firefox to ignore all flash annimations (the way images can be blocked from certain sites) Actual Results: A dialog openned with no way to disable it without downloading the software Expected Results: Either a checkbox on the dialog (ignore all content of this type) or a preference to set that same setting</description>

There every tab has a own close button, which appears when moving the mouse cursor over the tab icon. I often work with a lot of tabs and want to close some of them after switching. Therefore everytime the mouse cursor must be moved to the right end of the screen. I think such a feature for the tabs used in Firefox would be very useful, because of the ability to combine switching and closing without moving the mouse over the whole screen.

For instance, the upcoming Extention Manager could also have the ability to update Firefox when a new version is released. The update would download and install any files that are needed, and then restart Firefox. However, it will remember the opened tabs and form information, etc. so that when the browser is restarted, it looks as it was before it restarted. Would this be possible/would it cause problems? It could also make updating almost instant for important bugs, etc.</description>

      <title>"In Place Tablet Input Panel" icon doesn't appear for text input</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8 Service pack 2 for Windows XP (currently in beta) provides an update to the pen-input functionality of Windows XP Tablet PC edition. In supported applications, an "in place tablet input panel" icon appears/hovers next to any text input control when the tablet pen hovers over it. Clicking on the icon brings up a floating input panel that allows the user to input text directly into the text box. This is likely because Firefox doesn't include support for the Microsoft Active Accessibility API, which is used to track the input caret in text boxes. For more information, see http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dntablet/html/carettrack.asp Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Install Windows XP SP2 beta on a tablet pc (http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/winxppro/sp2preview.mspx) 2. Hover the pen over a text input area (e.g., the address bar) Actual Results: No text input panel icon appeared. Expected Results: The input panel icon should have appeared next to the insertion point caret. (See, for example, the Internet Explorer address bar after installing the service pack.)</description>

      <title>Standalone Print</title>
      <description>User-Agent: No javascript Build Identifier: It would be very useful to have a stripped down version of firefox to be used as a standalone print application. firefox-print --scale 0.7 --stylesheet foo.css --output file.ps URL This stripped down version would not need a running X11 display or the X11 libraries and would probably consist of little other than the gecko engine and a new main() function. It might read the firefox default stylesheets. This would be very useful in scripts and makefiles to automatically generate postscript files (and PDF via ps2pdf) from HTML documents with CSS. The --scale parameter would be similar to opera's scale function and would affect all font sizes, image sizes, and other sizes in the stylesheets such as margins and indentation. It would run under Linux, FreeBSD, cygwin, etc. and should be pretty easy to port. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce:</description>

I use the History sidebar in Firefox fairly frequently, and while it shows the title of web pages in the sidebar I think it would be really useful if the URL of a particular entry was shown as a tool tip text when the mouse is paused over the entry. This could easily apply to the Bookmarks sidebar as well. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open Bookmarks or History sidebar. 2. Pause mouse over entry in sidebar. 3. Notice that there's no URL displayed as a tool tip text. Actual Results: No URL is shown. Expected Results: The URL entry is shown in the sidebar.</description>

See also this user discussion: http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=78576 The Bug: Currently toolbar buttons can text entries can be dragged around the UI when the Customize... dialog is open. The "Main Menu" (by which I refer to File|Edit|View...) can also be repositioned as a block. It would be beneficial though to be able to move individual menus into their own blocks. This would allow fuller customisation of the UI by users - for instance moving the "Bookmarks" menu to the "Bookmarks Toolbar" (ala Safari I believe, though I'm not a Mac user so don't quote me on that). It might also allow for easier add/removal of menu items than by hacking around in userContent.css (though I accept that is of more limited appeal). Possible issues: Inherently powerful, but also offers users the opportunity to really cock up the UI if they dragged something where they didn't want it. Might require a "Reset Menu" button to protect them. Usability testing would reveal this. I would suggest that adding borders around each Menu heading (File|Edit|Etc...) when in Customise mode would make it obvious that they could be moved. I'd welcome the ability to customise the menus.

I don't know the ins and outs of Flash, so this may be a useless suggestion, BUT this process sounds (to me) to be workable: When the user middle-clicks on a Flash link, make the Flash application treat it like a left-click, but display the returned output in a new tab.

This is a bit of a pain compared to Seamonkey's easy-access memus, as brought up in the following topic: http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=80900 While I don't think adding menu bloat is the way to do this, would it be possible to duplicate the functionality of the Permit Cookies extension by default, and have a keyboard shortcut to whitelist the current page's domain? The extension can be found here: http://extensionroom.mozdev.org/more-info/permitcookies and currently uses Alt+C, although any good combination would do. Another great addition would be a "Add current site" button in the Cookie Exceptions Manager, but it would be somewhat less important if this can be achieved with a key combination. Apologies if this is a dupe, I couldn't find anything requesting this. Yes - we have the extension, but this is a problem that should be solved by default IMO. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Disable cookies by default, or use any combination that requires whitelisting of a domain. 2. Load a page which requires cookies. 3.

      <title>Display domain in status bar for secure sites</title>
      <description>Although we've got some protection in place for username/password-based URL spoofing (bug 232567), that doesn't cover all the possibilities. We need to have ever-present UI that, on secure sites, makes it clear what site any window, even a "chromeless" one, actually comes from. My assertion (as discussed with Darin and Ben by email) is that we need to make the status bar compulsory (like IE) and add the hostname to it when we have a secure connection. This means that people who "look for the lock" will get used to seeing the hostname of their bank right next door. I'm about to attach an implementation of this for Firefox, and would appreciate feedback on whether this is a) necessary, and b) the right way to do it. Gerv</description>

So I search within my bookmarks and there it is, listed in the found bookmarks. But I still dont know in what bookmark folder I have it. So I click on it, and select properties. There is no info on where my bookmark is located, in what folder of my many folders. I have some other bookmarks that I know are in the same folder, but cant find them. I cant find the folder not even searching for them, since there is no "Bookmark location" within it's properties dialog. I want to be able to select a bookmark from the search results and see it's folder location, that is... to be able to know where it's located at.

      <title>use sqlite instead of mork for history back end</title>
      <description>In addition to indexing, one doesn't have to reimplement SQL in open coding (f.e., groupby), and there are a variety of tools available for poking at sqlite. It's also multi-process/thread safe, when used correctly, and doesn't have to be maintained by us. I think it's a win, and Ben prodded me to hack up something appropriate. Interim patch coming up - autocomplete works, though doesn't have quite the right semantics WRT explicitly-typed prefixes yet - history pane works, in all the views I could see - RDF interface mostly works, except - GetSources - notifications I'm going to do the latter with triggers, and the former is just a matter of spending the time. You'll need to have sqlite-devel installed, and be building on Unix or else make appropriate arrangements in build/Makefile.in. The code got a bit simpler, too: 3 files changed, 893 insertions(+), 2586 deletions(-)</description>

      <title>Improving New User Experience</title>

Regardless of the visual merits of Qute vs. the new default theme, the key issue on this seems to be a fear that the new theme will 'turn off' NEW users who may not be aware of how to change a theme. This may be a valid point, and it is equally valid that these same users may also not like Qute as a default (yes, it is possible). The solution - to my mind - is this (for the record, I am a marketing and PR counsultant with nearly 20 years of expertise in trying to resolve issues just like we're having right now): Upon the first running of a *new* install of Firefox (or Tbird), via the default installer (which is what a new user will use anyway, particularly on Windows and Mac) on ANY operating system , the program should FOR THE FIRST INSTANCE ONLY OF THE PROGRAM'S RUNNING, send the user to a default page which says *IN THE VERY FIRST SENTENCES* someting akin to the following: "On behalf of both the Developers and the Mozilla community, welcome to what users and reviewers alike consider the finest Internet software available - as you will shortly discover, Mozilla programs allow you, the user, an unprecedented level of customization to the appearance and functionality of your Internet experience. By way of example, if you would prefer to change the appearance of this software - its 'look and feel' - click this link to see a wide range of alternate user interfaces and extensions designed by others in the community. Again, our thanks for your support of what is rapidly becoming a new standard of excellence for browsing and email - the Mozilla solution." The link should be to a jump page with options to go to the Texturizer or Firefox/Tbird/Mozilla theme / extension page(s). I believe this approach serves two functions - it THANKS the user for trying this new software (always a good thing to appear 'kindler and gentler' than the default solution you are seeking to replace) AND instantly shows them how to change the theme IF and I say IF they don't like it - right when they first run the software. Again - let us try to focus on positive, constructive solutions to this issue! I welcome any comments on this proposed solution - from both the community-at-large and most especially Ben or other developers. Many thanks for your time, consideration and lack of flaming if you don't agree with this proposal - Jonathan Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

I don't see any sense in having a New Folder context menu item in the Bookmarks Sidebar and Manage Bookmarks and not having New Bookmark. I create many more bookmarks than bookmark folders, as I'm sure does the average user. Creating a bookmark is also very context-sensitive as the position of the right-click dictates where to create the bookmark, either in relation to the currently-selected bookmark or in the selected folder.</description>

No external popup window is created. However, these ads are just as annoying, if not MORE so: because the ad is rendered inside the browser window, there are no UI controls to move or close the ad, so it is free to obscure the content! PLEASE allow this behaviour of Javascript to be turned off and/or regulated by the existing popup mechanism. When Javascript (or a style sheet) attempts to place a DIV element that overlaps existing content, it should be treated as a popup ad, and blocked! Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Go to http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/ 2. Notice the "Please take some time to register" popup at center. This is IMMUNE to Mozilla/Firefox's popup controls! Actual Results: See above. Expected Results: It should have treated the DIV as a popup, and allow it to be regulated/blocked by the user. Here's the vile script that does it: http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/clientscript/vbulletin_vbpopup.js The actual popup ad is a DIV element with a corresponding stylesheet. It defaults to hidden, but the script raises the ad and then hides it again after a timer expires.</description>

So, any page you're on, you just go to tools and choose Translate and it translates the page instantly via Babelfish. I think this a a great little feature that reviewers would like to write about when reviewing Firefox. It's a a feature that will help set the browser apart in the MS browser world and people can easily understand and relate to its tremendous added-value. Plus, the open source Konqueror has already integrated it, so the source code and model for implementation already exists. I think anyone at Mozilla who was interested in implementing this Translation feature would find it a big hit and a very, very useful feature to have. What do people think?

      <title>FastFind: A toolbar merging the find dialog and type-ahead-find</title>
      <description>This proposal came from a discussion a bunch of us (asa, ben, brendan, bryner, chofmann, dbaron, mscott) had at the Foundation, but I've filled in a some additional details that we didn't discuss, but also left a bunch of questions. The goal is to combine the efficiency of TAF with the discoverability of the Find dialog and make the whole thing easier to use. The basic proposal is that type-ahead-find would occur in a new toolbar that would drop down (logically in the style of a Mac OS X sheet, but visually just the bottommost browser toolbar). When the toolbar is shown, it is always the thing in the browser window that has focus -- anything that would cause it to lose focus to anything else in the browser window other than a menu should cause it to go away. This toolbar would show roughly what TAF currently shows in the status bar, along with some buttons (probably with hotkey labels, although that seems a bit awkward). Regular TAF (the no-"/" version) could continue to exist for links only as an accessibility feature. This toolbar would appear, with the textfield blank, and take focus, when any of the following things occur: * The user presses "/" (perhaps to be discontinued after a bit) * The user presses Modifier-F (Modifier == Appropriate platform modifier) * The user selects Edit | Find in this page... It would appear, with the textfield filled in with the previous search and simultaneously find the next occurence of the previous search, when any of the following things occur: * The user presses Modifier-G. * The user selects Edit | Find again (ISSUE: Is this really what we want "Find again" to do? Do we still want the menuitem?) While the toolbar is shown and contains text (when it is shown, it is always the thing in the browser window with focus), any of the following will also cause a "Find Again": * The user presses Modifier-G. * The user selects Edit | Find again * The user presses Enter for more than the first time (unless we use Enter to dismiss the toolbar). As the user types in the toolbar, the text would appear in the toolbar's text field and roughly the current typeahead find behavior would occur in the browser, highlighting the first occurrence of the matched text as a secondary selection. However, characters typed that do not match should appear in the toolbar (unlike now), along with a beep indicating there is no match (as now). This allows the user to delete typos without becoming confused. Future enhancement (hard): highlight the matching part of the text typed in the FastFind toolbar's text input (but don't highlight the non-matching characters that we would, in this proposal, allow the user to type). Question: Should TAF's concept of selection be merged with the real selection? That might be a little less confusing for users, but it actually doesn't seem all that useful and might get in the way. Future enhancement (hard): Highlight all occurrences of the string (in a different highlight color) once the user stops typing for a certain interval or presses Enter (unless we use Enter to dismiss the toolbar) When the user presses "Esc" or clicks on the page, the toolbar goes away, destroying the selection. Question: Or would there be an advantage to have two different ways of making it go away? I doubt the advantage would outweight the confusion, at least for the ways I can think of. (Current TAF uses "Enter" to mean "go away but make the TAF selection the real selection". However, I'd prefer it to mean "I'm done typing" and then "Find again", as above.) Question: If the user starts typing after pressing Enter, should the typing replace or append to the current text being searched? Where should the find start? Ideally, until the user uses the "Find Next" feature, the search should highlight (and, if needed, move the viewport to) the the first occurrence of the text whose location is below the top of the viewport. (Note that this might require restoring the original viewport position, e.g., if user enters "abcdef" and there's text "abc" in the sidebar, below the viewport, but text "abcdef" in the main part of the page (later in the content tree). Scrolling to see the "abc" shouldn't put the "abcdef" out of range because it's above the new top of the viewport.)</description>

      <title>Height of Toolbars and Tabs - should be more compact</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040614 Firefox/0.9 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040614 Firefox/0.9 The looks of Moz. Firefox could be more stylised. I feel the present toolbars and tabs are a bit broader and wider. In the Navigation Toolbar there is much space left above and below the icons and address box. This could be reduced for a compact look. Also the toolbars may be allowed to float and dock. By this the user could pull them and dock them to the space left after the Help menu item in the Menu bar. [save a little bit space :) ]. Please consider this. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

      <title>Can't select a custom location and name for Start Menu folder</title>
      <description>When I am installing Firefox I would like to be able to select where to install the Start Menu folder for Firefox icons and choose its name. Reproducable: always Steps to reproduce: 1. run the Firefox installer Current results: Firefox installer newer asks you about the location and name of the Start menu folder. It always just creates them in "C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Start Menu\Programs" and names it "Mozilla Firefox". Expected results: Firefox installer should ask you where to put the folder and what name should it have. So that it would be possible to create the folder in "C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Start Menu\Programs\Internet" and name it "Firefox" for example.</description>

      <title>newly added languages should appear on top of the list</title>
      <description>In Tools-&gt;Options-&gt;General-&gt;Languages, if you select a language to add, and click the "Add" button, the language appears at the bottom of the list of active languages. It should appear on top of the list instead. Bug 181541 comment 110 said: &gt; I expect that new users want to "Add" a language because they want their &gt; favorite web site to show up in their language if it's available. &gt; So I would like that adding a language adds on top of the list, first position, &gt; instead of last position. The basic configuration steps would be to add my &gt; native language, then bump OK, that's all, don't need to "Move up".</description>

Even in this "Details" textbox. In left-to-right based pages you cannot use the right Ctrl+Shift to type from right-to-left, and in right-to-left based pages you cannot use the left Ctrl+Shift to type from left-to-right; this gets very annoying when you try to post a link in a forum, trying to type it from right-to-left with the [URL] and the [/URL]. Whenever I want to post replies or threads (mostly in right-to-left based pages) I have to use the Microsoft Internet Explorer or the Notepad. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Enter any site that includes a textbox, such as a form, or a forum post textbox. 2. Click the textbox, so you could type in it. 3. If the site you are viewing is using left-to-right code (English/French/Spanish... sites) (the text marker shows on the left side of the textbox), try pressing the right Ctrl+Shift. 4. If the site you are viewing is using right-to-left code (Hebrew/Arabic sites) (the text marker shows on the right side of the textbox), try pressing the left Ctrl+Shift. Actual Results: The textbox wasn't aligned to the other side. Expected Results: The textbox marker should have moved to the other side of the textbox, allowing typing from right-to-left on left-to-right pages, or left-to-right on right-to-left pages.</description>

Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.go to Tools -&gt; Themes 2.try to install any theme located elsewhere except update.mozilla.org 3. Actual Results: Themes are only avaiable from the webpage update.mozilla.org Expected Results: Should have an option to install themes from other location. Example 1: There should be 2 options in Theme window: 1, get more themes from internet 2, install theme from local drive (the second option would open the usual file selection dialogue that allows user to browse his filesystem and point some theme file) Example 2: There should be the text "get new themes from" and below should be an selection bar with predefined content of "update.mozilla.org" or "local drive" and button "go", and if user decides to use "update.mozilla.org" it'll act as before, but if the user selects "local drive", it will open the usual file locate dialogue where the user will browse his filesystem and point some theme file. It's annoying to be not able to install otherwise than from official website. If there's already a way to install themes from local drive, it's quite hidden for ordinary user.

When you hover over them, they gain a thin 3D border, and clicking them results in a pushbutton effect. In Firefox however when you click a menu item, the 3D border does flip from raised to inset, but the menu item's label doesn't move, destroying the illusion of a button. This does not happen e.g. on the personal toolbar or on the regular toolbars; Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Click top-level menu item (file, edit, view, ...) Actual Results: The text on the menu item does not move 1 pixel to the lower-right when clicked. Expected Results: The text on the menu item should move 1 pixel to the lower-right when clicked. For firefox to look right on Win2K, this inconsistency should be fixed.</description>

      <title>Bookmarks Sidebar : Add folder position to the search results</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040614 Firefox/0.9 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040614 Firefox/0.9 When you open the Bookmark-sidebar (CTRL-B) and enter a search term you get the results as single bookmarks. It would be a nice option to display the folder-path they reside in in a tree-like manner. Main idea is that the simple name of a bookmark is not always a reliable identifier; when you have a lot of bookmarks it gets harder to think of meaningful names to assign. Since the adding of a bookmark via CTRL-D takes the page's title as the name you could better identify the bookmark by the location you saved in even if you didn't change the original name to something meaningful. Example: Instead of a search-result like this: Statistic Site-Statistic Stats Allover Stats it would be better to optionally have one like this: - Internet - General Statistic - WebSites - Work Site-Statistic - Private Stats - LAN Traffic - Allover Stats I saw that behaviour on a free search utility which is unfortunately only for Internet Explorer (DZsoft Favorites Search, www.dzsoft.com) and found it to be extremely useful.

      <title>propose enhancing XPI Installer dialog box with visual cues for readability and security</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040616 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040616 I have 3 ideas for the Firefox XPI Installer dialog to make it: 1. More readable 2. More informative 3. Stress the security (All 3 ideas are visually shown in the picture attachment.) 1. Rather than showing the entire URL of the XPI package, only show the domain. Most of the time we only determine the trustworthiness of a piece of code by it's domain and not it's entire path. e.g., 'ftp.mozilla.org' is good and 'xxxtoolbar.com' is bad. So rather than cluttering the screen with the entire URL, we should just show the domain. This makes the text easier to decipher and as an added bonus, it does not deter novices from reading it. The entire URL can still be made available as a tooltip for techies. 2. Supplement the word 'unsigned' with a visual icon. I've seen the word 'unsigned' in the space next to the package name in bold red letters and I figure that novice people won't know what it means. I'd rather the text not be there to avoid confusion. But since it has security merit, I'd suggest adding a visual icon that is more informative than the word alone. (It could even replace the word entirely.) The icon would still convey security information to techies but to the novices, they might treat it as eye-candy or notice the X through the pen to indicate that something is missing and therefore convey the meaning of it being less secure. 3. Make clicking 'Install' involve more steps, and therefore stress the layers of security. I propose adding a checkbox that has to be checked to enable the 'Install' button. When the user finds that they have to perform extra steps to perform an action, it will convey the meaning of extra layers of protection. This should stress the security implications of what they are doing so they would think twice. P.S. I also made the default button to be 'Cancel' rather than 'Install' but this is covered in bug #240637 which I had filed before. P.P.S. I also added a 'grippy' to make the dialog box resizable. This is just my personal preference. Feel free to ignore these suggestions as I know that Firefox doesn't have enough programmers and there already are too many things to do. I feel guilty because I myself am not a programmer and cannot contribute. But I am a User Interface designer. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce:</description>

Than, I've been asked to port that code to a sidebar. For the portability and simplifity, I wish to make it as a regular sidebar, rather than extension. I replaced the "window.open" by "location.href=", which works quite well in the browser window, but it can't work in the sidebar, as the browser load the javascript url from seperated browser environment. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: Look at the attached testcase. The first two codes works well, but the third work only in the browser, not on the sidebar. Expected Results: javascript: URLs should load on the browser, but with target=-moz-sidebar. (There is no -moz-sidebar property currently, but maybe this is required to reslove this bug.) Also note that Internet Explorer have target=_search, which can be used there for the built-in toolbar, so we can make a cross-browser solution with implementing target=_search for Mozilla.</description>

I do need javascript enabled on some sites, this includes my web banking site, but would prefer it off for all other sites. Rather than manually toggling this (be it via the main Web Features option or a per tab option through an extension) it would be a lot more convenient to have an option to NOT run javascript globally BUT have a whitelist of URL masks that are automatically allowed to use javascript anyway. The need for a mask is so that I can enable it for a couple of pages on livejournal where it conveniently gives nice menus, but disable it still for viewing comments and journals where people might try to pull stupid tricks with it. I'm sure there are other examples of such sites where users would want to selectively enable javascript. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce:</description>

      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040614 Firefox/0.9 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040614 Firefox/0.9 I've been using Safari a lot recently, and I've noticed that in its bookmark manager it's possible to have bookmarks outside the tree opened by the bookmark menu. I've found that this leads to a much greater feeling of organisation within bookmarks. You can see this functionality in the referenced URL -- the only items that appear in the bookmarks toolbar item are those in the "bookmarks menu" folder. All the other visible folders don't clutter up the menu when you need to select things from it. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce:</description>

      <title>Color the URL bar when using password and user name are part of the URL</title>
      <description>Like bug 244025 we might want to investigate coloring the URL bar when the user name and password are part of the URL. user:password@somesite.com Coloring the URL bar for this situation could replace the message box that pops-up each time you login to a site in this manner. We could use a one time message like the pop-up blocker to inform users about this feature. As for the color I would lean towards red hue.</description>

      <title>Adding a file type and association action to Firefox preferences</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040614 Firefox/0.9 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040614 Firefox/0.9 In the preferences &gt; download -- there are options to change the action of any filetype that is displayed in the box. But if the user wants to add some new filetype and action, what could be the option? If somebody removes a filetype from the list how can he add the filetype? Moreover Firefox doesn't remember what the user chose last-time he downloaded /clicked a link leading to some file. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: Expected Results: An &lt;add&gt; button along with the change and remove buttons. Using this the user could add a new filetype by the extension and add the related action.</description>

      <title>Go menu uses global history instead of session history</title>

It wasn't "broke", so why did you "fix it"?? :-( I am accustomed to, for example, going to the salon.com premium log-in page, which will take me to the home page after the log-in is processed. There, I select an article to read. Suppose that it is displayed over 5 sequential web pages. Do _you_ want to hit the "Back" button 5 times to return to the homepage?? _I_ don't. Instead, I just use the GO list to choose the home page, of course. BUT with Firefox, the history list is like the one in I.E., namely, it contains an entry for a page only once regardless of how many times the page was accessed. (So, it is not really a "history" or "log" of the actual order in which pages were selected and displayed.) The consequence is that after I have selected and read only a few articles, the salon.com homepage is no longer on the GO list. In summary, I really like the way that it is implemented in Netscape Navigator 7.1 -- indeed, the usefulness of the GO feature is the principal reason that I have preferred Netscape Navigator 7.1 instead of Internet Explorer!! Why do you want the Firefox GO feature to function like the lousy "history" feature of Internet Explorer 6.x ?? Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.see details 2. 3.</description>

Yesterday skype was made available also for Linux and imho having skype inside firefox as a sidebar would increase the number of people that will use both skype and mozilla firefox. I don't know if the sidebar could be made as an extension but it would be better to have it installed by default as a feature of the browser; anyway if you decide to go to the extension way please don't close this bug report until the extension is available ;) I think is a good idea with good potential and that shouldn't require a big effort for being implemented. If I'm wrong just tell me why :) ..and anyway let me know what do you think about it. (btw.. if you like it vote for this bug!) bye, Giovanni. p.s.

(VIA File-&gt;New Window or Context-&gt;Open Link in New Window) Firefox should do the same thing when other programs attempt to open a link using it.

While this may be ideal in *some* circumstances, in many cases it is a drag. An option should exist to view any text with line wrapping, in order to avoid horizontal scrolling. This would enable Firefox to read plain text based e-books such as those produced by Project Guttenberg. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Visit a site that has .txt files on it such as http://www.gutenberg.net/ 2. View a .txt file Actual Results: Open the file in another reader because text wrapping isn't happening This might also allow overriding &lt;pre&gt; tag line wrapping, providing a nice workaround for the highly annoying Bugzilla line wrapping bug which hasn't been fixed for six years! Would also improve usability of View Source. Should be an option, because there will be cases where line wrapping should be off.</description>

IMO so should Firefox, because icons in the desktop namespace are more prominent (they have no shortcut overlay) and easier to locate since they are not subject to the "Arrange Icons" command or the Windows XP Desktop Cleanup wizard. Though this bug is filed only for Windows XP, it is valid for all supported Windows flavours. Additional Windows XP Considerations: the XP HIG asks apps to not use desktop shortcuts and use the enhanced Start Menu instead. However, note that XP's IE *still* inserts itself into the Desktop Namespace, but remains hidden until "Show Desktop Icons" is chosen. I feel Firefox should do the same - users who *like* seeing desktop icons should get a Namespace icon instead of a shortcut. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

I think the default setting for the "print range" parameter should reflect this assumption. IMHO it would reduce the overall number of clicks needed to perform the operation, thus easing the use of Firefox. What is more, I regularly want to print small parts of large documents, but after selecting the area I want to print I usually *forget* to select the correct range in the dialog, and I end up with the whole document printed. Having the dialog default to "print selection" when relevant would prevent from this kind of mistakes. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Select a document area 2. Click File &gt; Print Actual Results: The Print Range is "All pages". Expected Results: The Print Range default to "Selection" when a selection has been made.</description>

In Excel or OOo Calc it's possible to drag&amp;drop from sheet to sheet in this way: Holding the drag&amp;drop-mouse-pointer for a moment over another tab, opens that sheet.)

      <title>Clicking a link targeting a named window should bring it back above, in front of its opener</title>
      <description>Assume the user has these 2 links in the parent/opener window: &lt;a href="document1.html" target="WindowName"&gt;1st document&lt;/a&gt; (...) &lt;a href="document2.html" target="WindowName"&gt;2nd document&lt;/a&gt; Actual results: if the secondary window named WindowName already exists, the other document or the same document (depends on which link was clicked) is loaded or reloaded but the window is not brought back above/in front of its parent/opener. Expected results: if the secondary window named WindowName already exists, the other document or the same document (depends on which link was clicked) is loaded or reloaded and the secondary window is brought back above/in front of its parent/opener. If Tools/Options.../Web features/Advanced... button/Allow scripts to:/Raise or lower windows checkbox is UNchecked, then the expected results in such case would not bring back above the targeted secondary window. -------- There is currently no non-javascript alternative to compensate such inherent windowing flaw with links. Re-using and recycling an already opened secondary window makes sense from the user's sytem resources perspective: this is where named windows can be a better alternative to target="_blank" ones. Some related references: CSS3 Hyperlink module: target-position http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-css3-hyperlinks-20040224/#target-position "The biggest fault with pop-ups is that it takes the focus away from the main browser window, and this can be disconcerting. It presents general usability issues aside from accessibility. How often have you seen someone launch a pop-up and then inadvertently click back on the launcher window and thinking that nothing's happened, click the link again with nothing happening? Of course the window has opened but is now under the launcher window, and only moving down to the task-bar and selecting the window from there will solve this.(...)"

      <title>Add a right click context menu to the back and forward menus</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win 9x 4.90; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040624 Firefox/0.9.0+ Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win 9x 4.90; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040624 Firefox/0.9.0+ When one right clicks the back or foward buttons, a menu pops up. But, when one right clicks one of *those* sites listed in this menu, instead of getting a context menu, the same behavior as a left click (it goes to that page) is executed. What I propose is a context menu to pop up on top of this primary menu when right clicking on these back and foward button history entries, as well as when right clicking the history entries in the Go menu. I think most effectively, the context menu options would be: Open (default), Open in New Window, and Open in New Tab (which happen to be the applicable options taken directly from the Bookmarks right click context menu). These options would coincide with and compliment the functionality given by the middle click enhancement of Bug 202819 "Middle mouse click on the back button opens previous page in new tab (enhancement)" and Bug 214816 "Middle click on links in go menu does not open a new tab", but would also dually serve as an alternative or replacement option for users who happen to have their middle click functionality disabled, unavailable, or assigned to alternative uses. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Right click on entries in the back, foward, and Go menus Actual Results: In the Back and Foward menus, the right click does the same as a left click and opens the page in the current window. In the Go menu, a right click does nothing. Expected Results: Expected results: A context menu opens up with options when entries are right clicked.</description>

Also, keep the quotes. To test, go to the run menu and type in an http:// URL. It should pop up a new mozilla window to the webpage.

      <title>Avoid shifting the page when toolbars appear or disappear</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win 9x 4.90; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040624 Firefox/0.9.0+ Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win 9x 4.90; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040624 Firefox/0.9.0+ Option set required to experience behavior described: "hide the tab bar when only one website is open" is selected "Select new tabs opened from links" option is deselected Actual Results: When one has only one webpage open, and a link is opened in a new tab, the entire webpage is shifted down slightly to accomidate for the tab bar appearance. I don't think this is the most optimal behavior, because the user loses the place on which his cursor was hovering, which is very distracting, especially while reading forums. (places where you open a lot of pages into background tabs, and then later read them one by one) I can partially understand the reasoning behind the current behavior, and maybe there is still a place for it, for instance, in the special case where the page is scrolled all the way to top. This way, top menus on pages won't be covered up by the tab bar. But for the sake of being simple and unconfusing, I propose providing an about:config option of doing away with this page shifting altogether. browser.tabs.barappears.shiftpagedown [b]true[/b] (default) Expected Behavior of this Enhancement: If this option is set to false, whenever the tab bar appears, it won't shift the page down. Thinking ahead: If this enhancement is implemented, I figured it would be best to make sure that people who use Tabbrowser Extensions and place the tabs at the bottom could still retain their expected behavior. The solution is to just have those people leave the option set at its default value. As is always best, those who know what the option does can change it, but those who don't won't be affected. Reasoning for the option's nomenclature: Note that I called the option "shiftpagedown" and not "pageshift" to specify the important point that it isn't an all inclusive disabling of the page shift, it only applies to the behavior of the page being shifted *down*. I suppose to make the option set symmetrical, in the situation where the user places the tabs at the bottom and happens to *want* the page to shift up when the tab bar appears, another default option called "browser.tabs.barappears.shiftpageup false" *could* be implemented as well. I personally see no reason for this though, and frankly feel it is pointless. Enhancement Test Case: Here is a test case that you can try with Tabbrowser Extensions if you would like. This current shifting behavior is not present in Firefox when the tab bar is at the *bottom* the browser; so you can use TBE to get an idea of what this option would be like. 1. Use TBE to place the tab bar at the *bottom* of the browser 2. Require that links that are opened in tabs open in the background 3. Make the tab bar hide when only one tab is open. As you will see, no page shifting occurs with this set of options and the effect is perfect; you just lose the slight amount of viewing area at the bottom that is covered up by the tab bar opening.

      <title>Text rewrapping in text areas</title>

I'm forced to use an HTML email interface, and often people send emails with fairly long lines. Especially when one adds to that the quotation marks "&gt;", the lines become too long, get wrapped and look way ugly. The text editor "joe" does the wrapping in a way I wish Firefox were capable of doing. If you have joe installed (has been on Redhat install CDs for a long time), you can try the feature by starting joe, pressing ^T W to disable line wrapping, typing more than abou 80 characters (some of which are spaces), and typing ^K J to wrap the text, while the cursor is over the paragraph to be wrapped. Joe recognizes "paragraphs" in the text quite smartly, and if no text is selected while ^K J is pressed wraps only the paragraph the cursor is over. The paragraph detection algorithm appears to be such that paragraphs are separated by empty lines, except "non-text" characters in beginning of the line are ignored. This way fe. in the above example with wrapping quoted text, paragraphs get detected correctly regardless of quoting. I suggest Firefox uses similar interface: if any text is hilighted, wrap it (I'm not sure if it should be considered one paragraph, or the paragraphs within it detected automatically as joe does), otherwise wrap current paragraph. It would also be good if there was some way to set the right margin manually. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce:</description>

      <title>While modal dialog/window up for a tab, cannot change tabs</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8 One of the webpages I was reading popped up a modal dialog box and I was unable to change to another tab. I wouldn't call this a bug as such, but it would be very nice if you could do so. In this case the modal dialog was prompting me for a password, and the password was displayed on the other tab (so I needed to change tabs to see the password). The modal dialog was actually presented by Adobe Acrobat Reader (version 6) as I was viewing a PDF file (from within the browser). I am not sure if a modal dialog presented by a web page has the same effect. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open multiple tabs. 2. Have one tab display a modal dialog box. 3. Try to change tabs. Actual Results: Could not change tabs until I had closed the modal dialog box. Expected Results: Allowed me to change to any tab, but not continue working on the tab with the modal dialog box until it was closed. A good example of this problem can be found by visiting this site: http://wpc.puzzles.com/gt-IV/index.htm If click and bring up the 'password' link on a seperate tab, and on the first tab click to view the pdf file you should see what I mean.</description>

They do in the Windows version. This problem first appeared with the switch to the Pinstripe theme, and has carried over to the new cross-platform default theme. The loss of site icons results in some decrease in usability, or user-friendliness, of the browser interface. With an apparent push towards a consistency in cross-platform appearance, there is now a second reason for their reinclusion. While I don't know much about these things, I don't believe there could be an XUL or native widget reason for the lack of inclusion, since the icons are still displayed in the Bookmarks Toolbar of builds from last year.

      <title>Add all bookmark keywords to location bar autocomplete drop-down list</title>
      <description>I propose that all bookmark keywords, whether they have yet been used in the location bar or not, be included in the location bar's autocomplete list. They could also have a bookmark icon next to them to indicate they are a bookmark and not a URL. The purpose of keywords is to make finding your favorite sites fast and easy. As such, my keywords are usually just the first letter of the bookmarks name (such as "b" for "bugzilla") so that it is, in effect, a hotkey. However, complications arise when I have two bookmarks with the same first letter ("bugzilla" and "Blogger" for example) and I risk losing efficiency or forgetting the keywords because they don't follow the first-letter system. If bookmark keywords where included in the autocomplete box, I could ditch my one-letter rhetoric all together and loose negligible efficiency. I could still enter "b" and then simply select, with a single keystroke, either "bugzilla" or "blogger". Now, wouldn't that be great!?</description>

      <title>keywords searches available also from the Search box</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; www.k2pdf.com; .NET CLR 1.1.4322) Build Identifier: The new feature of right-clicking inside edit boxes in forms, allowing you to save the search as a bookmark keywords, radically changes the way users can easily save their favorite search-sites. Mycroft searches will probably become less important. They don't work for forms that use HTTP POST instead of GET. They are too complicated to set up for non-tech users. So, I think it would be great if the search box on the toolbar was not exclusively dedicated to Google + Mycroft searches. I think user-defined searches really should be able to be accessed from that search box as an extra search engine. - There would be ONE "saved-search" concept; - There would be TWO ways of setting them up: user-defined by right-clicking on fields in forms AND server based pre-prepared Mycroft searches; - There would be TWO ways of accessing these searches: bookmark keywords (for turbo-geeks) AND an engine icon on the toolbar search box (for home users). I think the current double-concept (one thing is a Mycroft search, another is a user-defined search) is un-necessary, un-natural and reduces user options.

Possible "Feedback" is ; (A) Status bar message when link is clicked or mouseover. (B) Permission/denial dialog when link is clicked. UI to enable/disable this dialog is also required.

I would like to find the same interface (including bookmarks and settings) on all of my systems, and if i change a setting on any system, it applies to all other systems also. This would be easy to do if firefox could be told to store and use a bookmarks/settings file located on a writable network share that all systems can access. i guess things could get complicated if the network share became unavailable, but this could be handled by storing a local version of bookmarks/settings and consolidating changes when the share becomes available again. if the file becomes unavailable, and the user triest to make modifications to settings/bookmarks, it may be necessary to present a warning that says "updates to settings/bookmarks unavailable because settings file is currently unavailable. please ensure that network shares are mounted and configuration is set correctly." that message would need to be less cryptic for the standard user to understand. this option would need to be set separately from all other program options (because the all other options should be saved in the settings file), so i suggest that it be added as "Tools -&gt; Configuration Location." of course there should be a "default" option that would use the default "application data" or ".firefox" directory depending on platform. firefox would also need to "listen" for changes to the bookmarks/settings file made by other instances of firefox so that the interface is consistent instantly when updates are made anywhere.

It happens a lot with HTTPS connection or congested advertisement servers e.g. (good candidates for a 127.0.0.1 entry in the hosts file BTW). Netscape 4.x did it with a simple window.

The problem is, if I a visit foo.com, I might get lots of different sites under the domain blocked: ads.foo.com www.foo.com foo.com gfhsldjdfhgl.foo.com etc. Now, because the cookie manager organizes all the sites alphabetically, it can be VERY difficult and painful to locate all the exceptions related to foo.com in that tiny little scrolling list control, in order to unblock them. A search filter in there would make this much easier. I'm thinking a simple textbox, where if you enter anything into the textbox, every site that doesn't contain the substring disappears from the list. So, I can enter foo.com, and only see the cookie exceptions related to that domain. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

Using the browser in public places, it would eb desirable to have the browser ALWAYS show al clear hint whenever a new user uses the browser. As it is now, Firefox will only once (when you start it the very first time for a specified user like "...documents and settings\DUMMY\...") inform you that it blocks popups. As said, for systems in public places ("Kiosk mode") the behavior of firefox is not understood by inexperienced users. So a status box should inform the user every time the broser is restarted, and perhaps the popup-blocking icon should be a bit larger. The icon could also flash for several times, showing a tool tip.

Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: Expected Results: - Just show each tab with its title - when the mouse is rolled over a tab, it displays a close box on the right-hand side of each pane - this means that each tab has its separate close box - the current close box (as of 0.9.1) which saits on the right side of the window, outside of every pane, is too confusing and will be removed. (scientific reason: no direct manipulation - the same widget closes different tabs depending on the context/tab focus, and is not where you expect it. If each pane has its own close box, you know exactly what you are doing).</description>

The Restore Default Text Size is a very good idea and will be highly appreciated by everyone. It should be relatively easy to implement. The reason behind having this, is because it is all too easy to use hold down the CTRL key while scrolling the mouse wheel and thus change the font-size. There exists a natural desire in everyone to want to restore the default sizes. :-) The Customize menu item is very easy to implement as well and will provide a very natural feel to get into the Option/General/Fonts Dialog.

Since many web sites have large or many graphics, it is annoying to have to find a "clear" area where one can select "Back" in the context menu. I would suggest to only include the "Back" item, and not "forward, reload and stop" since these are rarely used during normal navigation, and these would make the image context menus needlessly long. This should be the case for all types of images, be they links or only an image itself. I will attach some screenshots of the context menus I could identify (there may be more). Suggested criteria for including something in the context menu: If a function is used often by many users (like "Back") or there exists NO keyboard shortcut that is easily reached with only the left hand (ALT+CursorLeft requires two hands), then it should likely be included in the context menu. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Follow a link somewhere to a page that contains images. 2. Right-click on an image Actual Results: No "Back" menu-item in the context menu. Expected Results: There should be a "Back" menu-item in the context menu.</description>

      <title>Include Firefox version number in Window Titlebar</title>
      <description>My request: e.g. replace "- Mozilla Firefox" by "- Mozilla Firefox 0.9.1" in the window titlebar. For official releases only. argumentation: 1. It's easy for users to recognise the version they have. 2. Simple a-technies won't have to look in "About Mozilla Firefox" 3. The name in the titlebar can be independantly changed from the UserAgent. The advantage of this is that visually the browser can be upgraded to eg "- Mozilla Firefox 0.9.1" while the UserAgent can remain "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040624 Firefox/0.9.0+" (0.9.0). If it's done like this than extensions do not need to be upgraded at every RC, but just at every milestone version. so the useragent can stay 0.9.0+ untill 1.0 Milestone is released while the browsername in the titlebar will change from: Mozilla Firefox 0.9.1 to Mozilla Firefox 1.0RC1 to Mozilla Firefox 1.0RC2 etc</description>

At present, Firefox always appears to pick one of its windows - probably the most recently used - and to overwrite the active tab with the new content. THIS RFE REQUESTS, a preference setting to allow alternative opening (2) in a new tab or (3) in a new window. [ (1) being what it does now ]. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce:</description>

      <title>Search should be Ctrl+E, not Ctrl+K</title>
      <description>Search should be Ctrl+E because: A) Ctrl+E is easier to press than Ctrl+K and searching Google is a very common action. B) Ctrl+E is Search in IE. When Ctrl+E opened the download manager, some people accidentally hit Ctrl+W or Ctrl+R, causing them to lose the current page. But if you're trying to press Ctrl+E to search, you're leaving the current page anyway, so dataloss is less likely.</description>

Something like a "global-config' file placed in the program directory. Can you imagine having to change options for 50 users? A user.js file isn't gonna do it, along with random profile directories in the mix. I know I can setup the defualt options, but this provides me with no way of changing them later on. I currently deploy Firefix via an MSI package with Microsoft Active Directory Software Policies, and have a costumozed defualt prefs file. I opened up a similair bug for Thunderbird.

So far ok. But it's incorrectly mentioned on all help pages that the shortcut key F4 selects the location bar in IE. It does not just select the location bar but also activates the drop down. I can use up and down arrows to select a page and hit enter. There is no such key in firefox. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

This feature can be quite insecure, because it's (too) easy to steal passwords this way. Either it should be switched off by default, made completely impossible, of the user should make some kind of choice. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Go to a http-auth site, and supply the username/pass by entering http://&lt;username&gt;:&lt;pass&gt;@&lt;site with http-auth&gt;/ 2. Click into the URL bar, and start typing the &lt;username&gt; (or use the drop-down button) 3. Notice that the autocompletion shows the password (or is showed in the drop-down menu) Actual Results: I see the password. Expected Results: Firefox shouldn't have showed the passwords, only the usernames and asked for the password instead.</description>

Since most users focus their gaze somewhere towards the middle of the content area--not at the very top--it would make more sense to have the new toolbar (in effect) cover up the top bit of the content area (actually: scrolling the window the height of the toolbar when the toolbar opens). Exception: if the content area is showing the very top of the document, just shift everything down (like the current behavior). Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Scroll somewhere in the middle of a page. 2. Open a new tab in the background or initiate the find toolbar. Actual Results: The content shifts down the window as the toolbar opens, disturbing the continuity of reading. Expected Results: The content should have remained in a fixed location on the screen, allowing the user's gaze to remain fixed in one place.</description>

      <title>installer should uninstall older version</title>

Not really a problem, but for the 0.9.x releases, choosing to uninstall say 0.9.1 after installing over it with 0.9.2 (in the same directory) uninstalls 0.9.2. I suggest that the Windows installer detect whether an existing Firefox (or Thunderbird, as it produces identical results) install exists and, if found, uninstall the old and install the new in the same directory. This would simplify and streamline release upgrades. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Have old release. 2. Download new release. 3. Double-click and run installer. Actual Results: I have two entries in "Add/Remove Programs" dialog for Firefox (or Thunderbird). Trying to get rid of the old entry by unstalling (when both were 0.9.x) would uninstall new install. Expected Results: Found old install, uninstalled it, and installed new release in same directory, keeping my extention and theme, if compatible. Sorry not really a bug, but many non-computer-savvy users may download new release, install, and then accidentally uninstall trying to get rid of the "old version" in the "Add/Remove Programs" dialog.</description>

      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows 98; Win 9x 4.90) Build Identifier: This is more of a feature request. Currently, there are several extensions that attempts to modify fx's behaviour so that legitimate popups, window.open() and DDE calls from other programs will open pages in tabs (either in the foreground or in the background), but they either don't work on all pages, or implement this function at the expense of the speed of the browser and its stability (eg. tabbrowser extension) Thus, I believe this function should be implemented in the core instead. A configuration page should be provided so that people can choose SDI mode or single window mode. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

      <title>Options to open bookmarks/history/etc. in new tabs/window with left click</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows 98; Win 9x 4.90) Build Identifier: I understand that one can open things in new tabs with ctrl clicking or middle clicking. However, those shortcuts are still less convinient than left clicking (People are simply more used to left clicking. Also, middle button is used more to scroll. Lastly, some old computer unfortunately not blessed with a 3button mouse (Macs and the PC I am using right now!)) and there are cases where people will almost always open the item in new tab/window in the background/foreground. I believe the following items should be considered: -Location Bar -Search Bar -Bookmark -History -External link (links on pages that points to pages on another domain) -Local Files I understand that url2newtab extension among other ones *partially* implements the features I have described above, yet this feature is very commonly used and I believe making opening pages in new tabs easier would really improve user experience and productivity by furthering exposing the huge benefits of tab browsing. It also have a nice side effect: although this feature seems small, fater user got used to this, they would really swear by it and would refuse to use any browser that differs from fx's implementation (ie. addicted) So with all the reasons above, I think this feature should be implemented in firefox's core.

It appears that Mozilla has a horizontal bar of a few pixels that runs from left to right that makes it easier to discern that active tab.

      <title>Import navigation toolbar configuration from IE</title>
      <description>When importing from IE, Firefox could look at what buttons the user has enabled in IE and enable all the buttons that have Firefox equivalents. Firefox could even import the order of the buttons. I don't know if this is a good idea. For one thing, the toolbar could get cluttered if we imported toolbar buttons from IE and also showed the search bar by default.

If a person had open a lot of pages or something special that is hard to track again it is hard to find again. Why not save somewhere information "we will be loading these pages" "these were already closed" to open the last state again if the browser crashes? I have sometimes lost ~50 tabs and had to re-search them... It's not fun. The feature should be quite trivial and non-bloat to implement and help greatly when the browser crashes. (Or if it jams, the user don't have to wonder for a while wether it comes back aroudn or not - just killing it and restarting brings the last state anyways.. ) Some things like being able to handle sessions (cookies) need a bit thinking though.

      <title>XPInstall Permission Manager: Blacklist feature</title>
      <description>Judging from the way many clueless IE users handle ActiveX installation dialogs, it might be a good idea to not even display the dialog/toolbar (from Bug 241705) if a site has bad track record. This can be done using a predefined list of blacklisted domains (not that there are any at the moment). The logic may be as follows: - If a site is whitelisted -&gt; Allow XPI installation - If a site is blacklisted -&gt; Disallow XPI installation and display an informative dialog if the user attempts to install an XPI (perhaps add an icon in the statusbar as well). - If a site is not listed in either of the above -&gt; Display the UI from Bug 241705 and let the user decide. It's probably only a matter of time until Mozilla-hostile sites are found. Having this blacklist would provide a good infrastructure for mozilla.org to release official releases that already come with a predefined blacklist that protects users against such sites. For reference, you can find a very extensive list of IE-hostile sites here: https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/ehowes/www/res/ie-spyad.zip Prog.</description>

You would first need to put your mouse over the tab bar and then simply scroll the wheel. Scrolling up would switch one tab to the left. Scrolling down would switch one tab to the right. I feel the the current tab functionality is very basic and it needs some improvement which wouldn't require any extra extensions. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce:</description>

      <title>installer should detect previous installation and give option to uninstall</title>

If one installs to the old directory, it overwrites the old version but the entry in "Add/Remove Programs" is still there so we end up with 2 entries while only one installation actually exists. Plus it's already considered go practice to install into a clean dir so the installer should take care of that. Perhaps a prompt saying, "there's an older version of Firefox in that dir already, do you want to uninstall it before installing this new one?". That way if someone want to run multiple versions they are still given the option to not uninstall the older ones. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Install 0.9 from Installer 2. Install 0.9.2 from installer (choose the same dir as from step #1) Actual Results: Goto "Add/Remove Programs", there is an entry for 0.9 and 0.9.2. Expected Results: 0.9.2 should replace 0.9 in the list</description>

In Firefox it appears to be a shortcut to not have to type in http://www.*.com. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Type in the URL 2. Press Ctrl+Enter Actual Results: It puts http://www.*.com around whatever is entered in the location bar and then tries to open that site. Expected Results: Open the specified URL in a new tab. I don't know if this is the intended behavior or not, but I really liked the Ctrl+Enter behavior of Mozilla.</description>

      <title>use kprinter if available; don't use internal print dialog</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.4) Gecko/20030630 Galeon/1.3.8 Build Identifier: n/a KDE's kprinter provides significantly enhanced printing capabilities, increases easy of use, and is available on many systems. kprinter provides access to all CUPS printers (offices typically have several), to "special" printers (e.g. faxes), and to various printing options. Just before printing (File-&gt;Print is run), Firefox should check for /usr/bin/kprinter existence and chmod +x. If it's executable, Firefox should ask the user if he would like to use kprinter or the internal printer system. If he accepts, then Firefox will print directly to kprinter. Firefox's own printer dialog is completely bypassed. A new configuration option will allow the setting to be reversed. Thank you. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Use any version of Windows since 95/NT. 2. Use almost any application there (including Firefox for Windows). 3. Click File-&gt;Print. Actual Results: I could easily print to any printer configured in the system. Expected Results: Used kprinter to provide equivalent feature-rich, convenient system. 0. Currently it is possible to print to kprinter, but requires extra steps. The user must go through Firefox's own printer dialog. This extra step confuses some users and is one of Linux's stumbling blocks for Windows junkies (as in our office environment). 1. Kprinter's web site http://printing.kde.org/overview/kprinter.php 2. OpenOffice on Linux somehow interfaces with CUPS too. Very nice.</description>

See bugs 209284 242137 249246, etc. These split into at least two types: site specific and universal. It would appear that the universal instances are usually associated with wild firewall setting. I found this little gem at the end of bug 209284: &gt; Additional Comment #5 From Andreas Kunz 2004-04-01 11:05 PDT &gt; Alex, apart from the question if this still happens, &gt; one information: &gt; Mozilla (and Firefox) connect to the local computer &gt; (127.0.0.1) before doing any other connection. Please &gt; make sure this connection is not blocked. How about a separate, more explict, dialogue just for this case? Something along the lines of "initial connection to localhost 127.0.0.1 refused. Probable firewall configuration problem" I commend this idea because it would help people understand what was going on, reduce the amount of traffic in the support channels, and shift the blame from Firefox to another product, helping with the image of the software. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: -0- This will, of course, do nothing to fix the site-specific "connection refused" problem.</description>

      <title>Ability to search for multiple words and also in the description field</title>

Interestingly it follows a quite similar principle like Firefox in its bookmark sidebar: if you type some characters into the bookmark search box, you get all of the matching bookmarks at once, real time. What is missing from Firefox to make this feature much more useable: 1. The ability to write multiple space separated word chunks. E.g. if I have 100 web dictionary bookmarks (with "dictionary" in their title) typing in "dic" will yield 100 result. I would like to further clarify the search by continuing to specify e.g. the language. E.g. "dic eng" would yield all English dictionaries, it would match e.g. "LEO [Eng]lish-German [Dic]tionary" ([chunk] represents the matching chunks) 2. An (at least in my opinion) logical consequence of this feature is that the search should consider all of the bookmark fields, most specifically the description field. E.g. for the bookmark "LEO English-German Dictionary" I would like to write "Woerterbuch" (dictionary in German) in the description, and I would like to find it when I write "woerter" in the search field. Presently you have to change the title to achieve that effect, which is clearly not a solution of you want to add 5-10 descriptory words. Idea: perhaps it should be configurable, which bookmark field is used in the search, if some users find that feature annoying. Remark: I brought the powermarks example only because the mentioned features are already implemented there, and all of the people I know are enthusiastic from the idea it implements. Of course powermarks runs only under Windows, and its Firefox integration is not comparable with the built-in bookmarks etc. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Write word chunks to the bookmark search field 2. Get all bookmarks where some words in some bookmark metadata field match some of the word chunks, and all of the word chunks are matched.</description>

Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Go to Checkout dilbert.com 2. block the adds on the right hand side 3. reload the page 4. go to 2. (stop when you find a MMFlash presentation there instead). Actual Results: I've got a MMFlash presentation there that I can't block Expected Results: Should have had an option in the pull down (or somewhere else that I can type the domain in manually) so I can block the popups.</description>

I request that the Enable Javascript (and possibly Enable Java) options have an Exceptions button implemented, indentical in function to the other Exception buttons next to the other options in Web Features. This would allow for whitelisting or blacklisting specific pages where the user does and does not want the page to use Javascript. Example: The majority of the pages I view only use Javascript for advertisements and bloat. Many of these pagess have alternative, HTML-only content. So, I browse with Javascript disabled. But, there are 3 or 4 pages that I use on a regular basis that cannot function correctly without Javascript (Hotmail, for example). I would like to be able to whitelist Hotmail so that Javascript is still enabled for that page only. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce:</description>

The way I typically use any browser is that I select a URL in some application, so that it gets copied into the clipboard. Then I bring up a browser instance or switch to one already present. Now I need to clear the location bar before pasting the new URL into it. But the moment I select existing URL to delete it, the one I saved in the clipboard is overwritten. Then I have to go back to the app and select the URL again and then paste it into firefox's location bar ! If firefox has a 'Clear Location Bar' button to the left of the location bar, then it would enhance its usability. You could make if optional if you guys think not enough people use it. If you want to look at this feature in actionm kindly look at 'konqueror'. It has a button that looks like 'x' (meaning clear, i suppose) at the left of the location/address bar.

      <description>Very low priority but would provide consistency with other folders. It should be possible to select a livemark as the bookmarks toolbar folder, this would mean that the headlines in the RSS feed would be displayed on the bookmarks toolbar, this would effectively make the personal toolbar a "News Toolbar" if you set it to a site like BBC, Slashdot, etc. Steps to reproduce: 1. Create a livemark 2. Open bookmark manager 3. Select newly created livemark folder 4.

However, if any of the search terms contain a dot, I need to prefix the query with the string 'keyword:' - tedious. Also, I don't feel very confident about Firefox's ability to automatically distinguish between hostnames and keywords. (At one time, if I entered the name of my development machine, but had forgotten to start the web server, I would automatically get redirected to a site with nasty pictures...) Therefore: Would it be possible to provide an option that, if set, would only trigger web searches if the entered string is prefixed by a question mark? (E.g. "? firefox 1.0"). This would seem like a safe and convenient solution. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

Since we dont have any time information in the menu, it makes things a bit confusing for quick everyday use. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce:</description>

      <title>history inconsistancies backbutton, forwardbutton, locationbar</title>
      <description>Using default theme- the back/forward button has a down arrow to the right/left of it - the down arrow does NOT behave like a button - click expands the history and click collapses it aswell The locationbar has a down arrow - the down arrow looks like a button but has no mouseover behaviour. - click expands the history but a second click does NOT collapse it (couldn't find bug # for it, new ?) Suggestions: - Make them look the same and behave the same - replace the down arrow with an up arrow when the history is expanded - replace back with down arrow if history is collapsed (this arrowstuff also should be implemented on the google searchbar)</description>

      <title>Cannot enable loading tabs from external URI's, installing extensions cripples brower</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040628 Firefox/0.9.1 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040628 Firefox/0.9.1 This may encompass two issues, apologies, this is my first use of the system. Recently installed 0.9.1 for Mac, replacing 0.8. In 0.8 clicking an external URI (Slashdock, Thoth, Eudora) would load URI in new tab in existing window, or open a new window if none was available and load all subsequent URI's there. In 0.9 the default is to open a new window. Thought that the solution would be to install an extension to enable this functionality. Installed Single Window 1.0, restarted. Bookmarks toolbar came up blank, all bookmark items under the menu had disappeared, and right mouse clicking on the tab bar produced a blank square. Restarted. Same thing. Unistalled extension, restarted, everything returned to normal. Tried a different extension (Tabbrowser Preferences 0.6.5), same thing happened again. Uninstalling the extensions brought the browser back to normal. Uninstalled the theme that I had installed, went back to the default theme and tried again. Same thing happened. Reinstalled Orbit Grey theme and tried again, same behavior. I have screen shots of the browser windows appearance, in .png, if that would help. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.Install extension for tabbed browsing, both over the wire or locally by drag and drop. 2.Restart Actual Results: Browser window presents abnormally, no bookmarks, no tabs, funny tiny empty square under mouse pointer on right click. Expected Results: Allowed me to open URI's in new tab, in existing window. about:buildconfig Platforma cel i586-pc-msvc Narz&amp;#281;dzia Kompilator Wersja Flagi kompilatora $(CYGWIN_WRAPPER) cl 12.00.8804 for 80x86 -TC -nologo -W3 -nologo -Gy -Fd$(PDBFILE) $(CYGWIN_WRAPPER) cl 12.00.8804 for 80x86 -TP -nologo -W3 -nologo -Gy -Fd$(PDBFILE) Argumenty konfiguracji --disable-tests --disable-debug --enable-optimize --disable-shared --enable-static --enable-crypto --disable-composer --disable-ldap --disable-mailnews --disable-profilesharing --enable-extensions=cookie,xml-rpc,xmlextras,p3p,pref,transformiix,universalchardet,typeaheadfind,webservices,inspector --enable-static --disable-shared</description>

      <title>Remove PROVISIONAL items in Firefox Advanced options</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040614 Firefox/0.9 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040614 Firefox/0.9 I guess the parts marked with PROVISIONAL in the Options-dialog of Firefox (under Advanced) will be removed or moved to another place in Firefox before Firefox hits the version 1.0. I did not find another bug report about this and was curious as to what will actually be done with these security options in Firefox. Where should these options be moved to and how should these be presented to the user so that terms like CRL, security devices and OCSP really mean something to them ? It seems to me that these texts will not be appearing in 1.0. IMHO, this should be resolved when Firefox reaches version 1.0. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. start Firefox 2. use menu Tools - Options 3. select Advanced (if not already selected) Actual Results: The lower two items (Certificates and Validation) are marked PROVISIONAL. Expected Results: Have these options available in a more suitable place in the browser.</description>

      <title>Firefox should remember alternative stylesheet settings for webpages (and websites?)</title>

It only makes sense for the browser to remember the preferred stylesheet so that users don't have to set them again each time. I might be mistaken, but I don't believe that any major web browsers have this feature yet. The way things are, users are discouraged from using alternative stylesheets, and web developers are thus discouraged from creating them. Giving users the ability to keep their selected stylesheet for a website would be a significant step in allowing them to experience the Internet how they wish without requiring much technical know-how, which I feel is one of major benefits of Firefox.

Actual Results: 3rd step - the "save as..." dialog opened to the same directory i saved the .jpg to, i had to start over at the top (my computer) to navigate to the correct place. Expected Results: remember that i choose "always save to this location" on my previous .qfx download, and use the .qfx location instead of wherever the last "save as..." went to.</description>

      <title>make it clearer that whitelisted cookies aren't downgraded to session</title>
      <description>Users aren't discovering one of Firefox's most awesome privacy features, the ability to downgrade cookies to session except for sites on your whitelist. One user even requested that we add the feature (by filing bug 252902) despite the fact that we already have it. Ideas: * Add text to Options &gt; Privacy &gt; Cookies or to the Exceptions dialog explaining that if you select "Keep cookies until I close Firefox", you can allow specific sites to store long-term cookies using the Exceptions dialog. * Go back to using radio buttons instead of a dropdown. Replace "Until I exit Firefox" with "When I exit Firefox, only keep cookies from sites I have whitelisted." Once bug 217199 is fixed, we can remove the "Ask me every time" option and replace the radio group with a single checkbox.</description>

I, among a lot of people, value browsing space very highly (I keep all toolbars on the menu bar), and so being able to close that bar once I've seen it would be very useful. I know there is the option to never show the bar, but I like being able to see when popups are blocked. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Go to a site which opens a popup window (e.g. http://andy.tom-h.com/Misc/firefox_demo1.html) 2. The popup information bar opens Actual Results: Popup information bar opens, only way of getting rid of it is to permanently disable it. Expected Results: There should be a close 'X' at the right of the bar (like the tabbar/FAYT bar).</description>

      <title>Plain text (text/plain, text/javascript, text/css, etc) documents should word-wrap</title>
      <description>There's a seamonkey bug, bug 16909 , that has a patch to enable wrapping of plain text documents viewed in the browser window. I think this should be ported to Firefox. It adds a "View -&gt; Word Wrap" menu item, which would toggle the wrapping status of the current document. I don't think the patch there is perfect, since that code has the menuitem toggling a pref, which doesn't make much sense to me. Also, the patch doesn't disable the menuitem on non-plain text pages, which it ought to. Otherwise I think this is a useful feature. I'll port that patch in a little bit. This obviously isn't going to make FF1.0, so no hurry.</description>

      <title>mousing over label element in Windows XP when referring input type checkbox or radio button should highlight the inputs</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040729 Firefox/0.9.1+ Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040729 Firefox/0.9.1+ In Windows XP with IE mousing over a labeled text that contains a for="" pointing to a radio button or a checkbox input will highlight the given input. This gives feedback to the user as to the clickability of the element. You might want to consider this as a usability enhancement, too. Take a look at the http://www.mozillazine.org/ page. There is a quick poll sidebar that contains radio buttons properly surrounded by label tags, like so: &lt;label for="response5" accesskey="5"&gt;&lt;input name="vote" value="5" id="response5" type="radio"&gt;I've constructed my own homepage, because Hixie is my god, and I must do what he does.&lt;/label&gt; When mousing over the text there is no affordability towards it's clickability. Though if you mouse over the radio button it does get highlighted, as every radio button in IE. Note that this behaviour is already in the chrome. At least in Windows XP (either because the OS supports it or because Mozilla/Firefox do something in that regard.) To test, in either Mozilla or Firefox, click on this link: http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/latest-trunk/Firefox-win32.zip to download the file. The window dialog that opens up contains two radio buttons and one checkbox. In Windows XP mousing over the text for each one of those inputs highlights the input giving a hint about being able to click over the text to get the input changing state. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Visit http://www.mozillazine.org/ 2. On the right hand side (the poll section) mouse over the text for each one of the radio buttons. Actual Results: The radio buttons don't get highlighted as you mouse over the text with label tag pointing to the input id. Expected Results: The radio buttons should highlight.</description>

      <title>nine steps to better menus in Firefox</title>
      <description>This may be partially covered by Firefox bug 243078 and browser bug 37694 but this bug is to track Firefox improving the usability of menus by making style and positioning adjustments. If we can do that by moving to nsITheme native menus, great. If not, we'll need to see how much of this we can do in the winstripe theme and minor XUL hacks. 1. Sub-menus should be moved three pixels to the left and raised 4 pixels vertically. 2. Main menu toolbar menu items need to have a blue highlight hover and click style rather than the raised and depressed bevel button on highlight and click. 3. Menu border needs to be reduced to 1 pixel from the beveled 2 pixels. 4. Menu checkmark needs to be moved two pixels down and one pixel to the right. 5. Blue selection highlight for menu items needs to be moved down one pixel in relation to the menu item label (or the label moved up within the highlight, whichever you like.) 6. Topmost menu item in the menu needs to be raised 2 pixel vertically. 7. Padding below a menu item label and above a separator needs to be increased by 2 pixels and the padding above a menu item label and a separator needs to be increased 1 pixel. 8. The entire set of menu item labels need to be moved three pixels to the left. 9. Separators need to be at least two pixels wider, reducing the padding between the ends of the separator and the right and left borders of the menu to 3 pixels.</description>

Say I visit the BBC Tech news site (linked). I then choose the little livemark option from the status bar and add a lovely new magical folder to my bookmarks menu. What I'd like to do it be able to middle-click on that "folder" and it take me to http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/default.stm (the refering home page). After looking at the XML it looks as if there is a &lt;link&gt; http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/click/rss/0.91/public/-/1/hi/technology/default.stm &lt;/link&gt; tag in the code which I presume is in all RSS feeds. Otherwise maybe using a src="" tag in the bookmarks.html feed to link it? Once again apologise for being vauge. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Add livemark from BBC Technology page 2.

Firefox still uses Alt+A for legacy reasons. It is more reasonable to follow the GNOME standard in this case. As such, bug 233462 should depend on this one. Is there even any other GUI application that uses Ctrl+A like another Home key? Select All is a more common action, and using Alt for a shortcut just looks tacky.

I guess it does the same like when entering the word in the search-bar while google is selected. But it's possible to have also other search-plugins installed. I suggest that for all search-plugins, there should be such an context-menu item available. So the user could easily select a word and search for it at ebay or amazon or whatever he has installed as search-plugin. Reproducible: Steps to Reproduce:</description>

Any clever ideas? In *principle* it should be possible to separate out the functionality of the profile that has to be per-instance from the parts that could be handled by on-the-fly granular locking.

Whilst the ‘Ask’ preference allows for this scenario, it leaves you to manually block thousands of cookies as you are just browsing around. It would be helpful under the cookie privacy settings to have separate settings for cookies set when you follow a link, and cookies set when you submit a form. If you are browsing the web then any page that sets a cookie before you give it any information is obviously just tracking your browsing, however if you have submitted a form then it is a genuine chance you may wish to allow the site to use a cross-session cookie so you do not have to fill in the form again.

This request is for an "undo close tab" or "recently closed tabs" (sub)menu. When a tab is closed, it should be saved to a cache, and there should be a menu somewhere in the UI to show this cache. Clicking on an entry on the menu opens a new tab with the same contents as what used to be in the corresponding entry. This should save the "buffer" to the cache, not just the URL, so that "unclosing" a tab that was displaying the results of submitting a form would still work. An UI command that can be bound to a key should be available to "unclose" the last closed tab; this should be bound by default to something (TBE uses Ctrl-Shift-Z, but maybe Ctrl-Alt-W or something like that would also make sense).

I couldn't believe it when it happened, cause in all my years of browser use I've never had it happen before. A look in help shows that Ctrl-W will close the window, though I don't think I hit that, but might have. Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce Steps to Reproduce: 1. Filling out form 2. 3. Actual Results: Window disappeared -- got closed? And I definitely didn't want it too. Expected Results: Don't want any keyboard keys/combos that will close window.

      <title>Add support for exporting specific bookmark folders</title>
      <description>This is a feature request. I believe it would be very useful if users could export just one bookmark folder at a time, or even select which bookmarks are to be exported. As far as implementing this in the UI goes, I suggest adding a context menu item in the Bookmark Manager ("Export this folder", "Export this bookmark"), but then the Export wizard itself should (preferrably) get enhanced. For example, we could put two radio buttons labeled "Export everything" and "Select what to export", and when the latter is selected it would show the bookmark tree and allow a user to select what to take, either by ways of individual checkboxes or a more file-manager-like approach, where Ctrl-clicking would select other items. To make this vision more concrete, please see the following homemade ASCII mockup: +--------------------------------+ | Export bookmarks [X]| +--------------------------------+ | [O] Export everything | | [ ] Select what to export | | | | +---------------------+ | | | + Bookmarks | | | | |-- Livemarks | | | | | |-- adot's notbl| | | | ... | | | +---------------------+ | | [OK] [Cancel] | +--------------------------------+ This is just a mockup I drew from the top of my head, there are, most likely, more elegant ways to get the same functionality.</description>

Once in Firefox, it is not a problem. I would like it if the intaller had the option to remove the IE icon from the desktop and put in a new Icon that used the same graphic but links to Firefox. Maybe even call it Internet Explorer, but have it launch Firefox. This would make it a lot easier to switch people over... Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. install firefox 2. set firefox as default browser 3. clicking IE still launches IE Actual Results: IE opens even though firefox is default browser Expected Results: Firefox should open when I click on IE (which is really "browse the web" in 99% of the world's minds).</description>

      <title>authentication support for live bookmarks</title>
      <description>I am now experiencing the wonders of Live Bookmarks, and have set up a shared bookmarks folder. http://www.decrem.com/bart/archives/000061.html. Now I want a private bookmarks folder. So I want to put a .htaccess file in my Movable Type blog directory. Desired behavior: - If I have a live bookmark that points to an RSS field that's access-restricted, when I click on the live bookmark, the authentication box should pop up, asking for my name and password Actual behavior: - If a live bookmark points to an RSS feed that's in a protected directory, I get an error message saying "unable to obtain feed" Workaround: - I can go to a web page in the protected area, and then Firefox will prompt me to enter the password and ID. So my feed is private, and I can gain access to it, but the behavior is somewhat clunky.</description>

I use the numeric keypad to move the mouse around, and discovered caret mode (F7) mode today. It's great to be able to use the arrow keys to move around the text in the page and select links and text in this way. One thing I have problems with is clicking buttons. While I can move the caret onto the button, I can't click on it easily, and end up having to move the mouse anyway. If I had another shortcut (control-f7 or the like) to jump the mouse pointer to the caret, I could then move the mouse slightly if necessary using the keypad and then click on the button. This would help my navigation significantly. Thanks for a great product with great features. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Hit F7 2. Move the caret around using the arrow keys 3. Oops! Gotta move the mouse to click on a button. Actual Results: Extra mouse movement required. Expected Results: Offer a shortcut to jump the pointer to the current caret location.</description>

      <title>allow disabling of link dragging in order to select link text</title>

Let me just say I find it useless and suspect that many or most other people do as well. However, I select text from web pages constantly, to copy and paste into emails, search forms, etc. Sometimes the text I want to select is in a link. In that case, I must be extremely clever to figure out where on the page I can click to make my desired selection. For example, on the http://texturizer.net/firefox/, in the sidebar, try to select the strings "Shortcuts", "Documentation", or "Keyboard". You can do it, but it's hard. I suggest that link dragging should be disabled by default, but enabled via an extension, preferences panel, or something like shift-click. Alternatively, for people who get annoyed by link dragging, please at least put an option accessible via prefs.js to disable this. I searched all over the web and found no solution. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. click on link 2. drag to select text 3. release mouse button Actual Results: A cursor with a picture of a piece of paper appeared, then snapped back to the starting point of my click. Expected Results: Allowed me to select the text.</description>

      <description>There should be a keyboard shortcut to go to the URI from the clipboard. Ctrl+Shift+V maybe. I use the equivalent feature in Opera all the time.

The document tree is shown below." While what it is saying is correct, this message should be removed. It implies that all XML files must have a stylesheet, which is not always the case. A common use case of a browser is for people to open an XML file (in my case XSD's) to get it pretty printed, and then to print out the formatted text. This message has no relevance in this case and is extremely annoying. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open an XML file without style information in the browser 2. 3.

There are many web sites which accept large files through web page forms. Reproducible: Didn't try Steps to Reproduce: 1. Go to web form which accepts large files. 2. Browse... to a local large file. 3. Submit the form. Actual Results: The browser says it is sending the form, and the pointer and toolbar icons rotate. Expected Results: There should be an indication of percentage, relative or absolute progress. For example, the progress bar in the lower right corner of the status bar should update to show the relative progress in sending the file(s). This was fixed in the browser component, see bug 24197.</description>

For Popups its a statusbar icon and a browser message, for installs it a browser message, for images its a context menu item, and there is no notification for cookies. When bug 240070 lands there will be several other types of content that could be blocked. I suggest a common way of notifying the user of blocked content should be developed. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: I think both the statusbar icon and browser message are a good way to notify the user. Using this combination may be an issue though if multiple content is blocked at the same time for a site. Also it would be good if the user could allow the blocked content for one time, the message should be closable, and the should be keyboard access to it.</description>

      <title>[Windows] reset IE to default browser upon uninstall of Firefox</title>
      <description>when we uninstall Firefox on Windows we should reset Internet Explorer as the default browser. right now we reset to the previously installed (potentially older, obsolete) copy of Firefox. although, what happens if there's no other copy of Firefox installed? does the uninstaller do the right thing and reset to IE in that case?</description>

      <title>when backspace goes back a page, avoid focusing a textbox</title>
      <description>i am pro-backspace for navigation (sorry Bug 219203) but i run into problems with google and similar sites that use javascript to set the focus to a form element. so i'm merrily pressing backspace, moving backwards through my browsing trail, and all of a sudden i hit the main page of google and javascript is triggered, and now my cursor is locked in the google textbox. i think the principle of least surprise would suggest that if backspace is pressed within a certain number of milliseconds of a previous "go back" action, then it should be interpreted as a "go back" action and not a "backspace" action--even if google (or blogger or m-w.com) sticks the focus in a form widget. ...or since the problem is with the "onload" event, perhaps it should be surpressed when going "back" to a page?</description>

Not in forefox. You have to type the same IP address twice! Tools - Options - General - Connection Settings... - Manual proxy configuration - Type HTTP Proxy. (Since there is no same as HTTP Proxy option, I have to type the same IP address again) It's a minor issue but wasted several hours after every installation. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Tools 2. Options 3. General 4. Connection Settings... 5. Manual proxy configuration 6. Type HTTP Proxy. Actual Results: I had to type SSL Proxy (same as http) again Expected Results: same as HTTP Proxy option should be enabled by default. It's a minor issue but wasted several hours after every installation of firefox.</description>

      <title>Firefox DLLs/EXEs not bound</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040803 Firefox/0.9.3 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040803 Firefox/0.9.3 The load time for Firefox can be improved if the EXEs/DLLs are bound. You can see from various tools that Microsoft does this with Internet Explorer DLLs/EXEs but Firefox does not. Some tools that are helpful to determine this are lipo32 and pedump. You can download these from http://www.wheaty.net to determine this. If a DLL/EXE is not bound, the lipo32 tool will show this. See http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/0500/hood/default.aspx for information on why bind is important to performance. Also, see http://staff.develop.com/igriffiths/techinfo/winmem.html and http://www.msdnaa.net/content/?ID=1323 See http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/tools/tools/bind.asp for usage information on bind. As part of the install package for firefox someone should do a bind. Microsoft does this for many of their products such as Microsoft Office. This may help startup performance by about 6%. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Download the lipo32 tool from http://www.wheaty.net. The tool is in the liposuction32 download. Also, download pedump from the same site. 2. open a command prompt 3. change to the directory where firefox is installed, e.g. c:\program files\mozilla firefox 4. for /f "tokens=*" %i in ('dir /s /b *.dll *.exe') do lipo32 "%i" Actual Results: The lipo32 tool will show that the EXEs/DLLs are not bound. Also, you can run pedump on the EXEs/DLLs and it will not show any bound import descriptors for the files. Expected Results: The install package should bind the DLLs/EXEs after they are installed. It is important to run bind on the user's machine since bind will link DLLs/EXEs to system DLLs which will likely be different from the build machine and the target machine.</description>

      <title>search plugins cannot be reordered</title>
      <description>the order of search plugins in the search menu/toolbar are not alphabetically reordered after installing a search plugin or after restarting firefox, contrary to bug 225717. bug 255543 proposes a search toolbar context menu option to alphabetically order the plugins manually. however, there should be a mechanism to manually reorder the items using the mouse similar to the method used for reordering bookmarks in the bookmarks menu. in fact i would go so far as to say that search plugins are just special bookmarks and should be managed via the bookmark manager</description>

So, in Firefox 0.8, you would right-click on a file download, and choose “Save Link to Disk”. The file would be added to the Download Manager and start downloding without any further clicking. In Firefox 0.9, even if you have that option checked, it still pops up a dialog box asking where you want to save the file to. What a waste of time. Plus, most servers limit you to two simultaneous downloads. So if I was downloading multiple files from a site, Firefox 0.8 would stack them all in the Download Manager and handle everything for me. But now, with Firefox 0.9, the dialog box for the third file doesn’t even show up until the first two are done. I would like to see downloads done the old (0.8) way in the next release.

      <title>Easier way needed to create Live Bookmarks from &lt;a&gt; links to feeds</title>
      <description>repro/demo: 1. go to http://www.tweakers.net./ 2. at the bottomright of the page is a blue [RSS] button, rightclick on it 3. select -- Bookmark this Link -- from the contextmenu 4. The -- Add Bookmark -- dialoue pops up exp: After selecting "Bookmark this link" the -- Properties for "New Live Bookmark" -- dialogue should pop up. A lot of sites have the RSS feed only available via this kind of link so it would be nice if we could directly bookmark them i/o having to copy/paste the url via Bookmarks-&gt;Manage Bookmarks-&gt;File-&gt;New Live Bookmark.... It's not that the current method doesn't work, but it is user unfriendly. ( this bug is vaguely related to bug 251394 )</description>

An option in the Advanced Javascript Options dialog to prevent pages from doing this would be desirable. Some sites implement their window sizes poorly and content is obscured by the fixed size window. Allow Scripts to: "Disable window resizing" is probably a suitable option name, I guess. This page &lt;http://www.whitestripes.com/discs/elephant.html&gt; uses the technique. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open &lt;http://www.whitestripes.com/discs/elephant.html&gt; 2.

This could eventually be extended to support other operating systems. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce:</description>

At the moment if you get Firefox to ask what to do with cookies on a case by case basis you get four options: ........Show details ........Allow ........Allow for session ........Deny ........Use my choice for all coookies on from this site I think it would be extemely useful to have an option for: "Deny for session" This is because some URLs set lots of cookies or keep on triggering the ask function masssive numbers of times. The only way currently to stop this is to deny the setting of cookies permanently. But you might not want to do that if after some browsing you need to accept cookies, for example, to allow passwords to be recorded or to enable financial transactions etc. In addition I think there should be a toobar button/menu option for modifying the current remembered cookie setting for the current particular URL. This avoids the considerable inconvenience of making these changes through the cookie management option "Deny" could be changed to: ........Ask ........Ask for session ........Allow ........Allow for session "Deny for session" could be changed to: ........Deny ........Ask ........Ask for session ........Allow ........Allow for session "Allow" could be changed to: ........Ask ........Ask for session ........Deny ........Deny for session "Allow for session" could be changed to: ........Ask ........Ask for session ........Deny ........Deny for session The dialogue box for this should indicate what the current status is for coookie management so you can be sure what you are changing from.

      <title>Add link(s) to reporting tool in Firefox</title>
      <description>As we get ready to implement (at least part of) the reporting tool, we need to get some links, so users can easily access the tool. Ideally, it would be situated in the Help Menu with 'Tell A Friend' and 'Promote Firefox'. At a minimum, we need a bookmark. Optimally in addition to the Help menu, we need a link in the bookmark toolbar on a default profile setup. ideal link format would be: http://reporting.mozilla.org/?url=http://host.tld/dir/page.html With the last part obviously being the current URL of the visible tab so that user does not need to copy/paste the URL. I'll file a separate bug for seamonkey. Per discussion with Asa, we need to do this *quick* for localization freeze reasons.</description>

      <title>Compatibility information bar</title>
      <description>With http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=5063 community got to know about new document.all support. People are arguing if it was proper solution. This bug has suggestion to make situation better through Evangelization. Information bar, yellowbar or toolbar just below tabs is powerful communication means (as opposed to small icon in status bar). Suggestion is to show bar in blue color with information about non-standard compliant event, just like popup blocked or XPI install blocked yellowbar does. There can be many sources of such event triggering, improper HTML, improper JavaScript, other problems. Suggestion is to include several actions in the bar, to help web become better (to correct problem that made bar pop-up). * JavaScript Warning. link to JavaScript Console to show actual warning that made bar pop-up * Link to explanation of the problem. Link to Evangelization initiative of Mozilla (possibly http://evangelmoz.mozdev.org/). Best to page with explanation of the problem. * Email to site maintainer. mailto:webmaster@&lt;site&gt; (or author from META tags if present) link with subject and body pregenerated that explains the problem to webmaster of website causing errors. User would add several words himself, or just press Send. * Report to Evangelization team. The link that would register incident in Evangelization project database. Projects with higher priorities (banks, popular sites) would get assistance from Mozilla to convert their web applications to standards compliant mode. * Not UI but Evangelization. Backhit for the page with User Agent string replaced with error and URL. Webmasters would have special entries in the statistics about the problem they have with the site. This action should be configurable. * Options Link to configuration of this compatibility Information bar. * Close Close button to close the bar immediately (not waiting for page reload). The Compatibility options would allow user to select level of conformance he want to be notified about. I'm not specialist in quirks mode, etc., but people do and can comment on this bug.</description>

      <description>Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.2) Gecko/20040812 Firefox/0.9.1+ Steps to reproduce: 1. Find a page that scrolls vertically. 2. Press the down arrow key. Result: Firefox scrolls 1 line. Expected: Firefox should scroll 3 or more lines. This would be more useful and match IE. IE seems to scroll based on a percentage of the window size or content area height. Maximized at 800x600, IE scrolls 3 lines. Maximized at 1024x768, IE scrolls 4 lines. Maximized 1600x1200, IE scrolls about 7 lines (not a whole number). We should do something similar. Bug 200213 is the same bug for Seamonkey.</description>

As it is today, a bookmark is opened in the active window/tab. If bug report 227241 is implemented, this setting should decide whether the bookmark is sopened in a new window or a tab. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open a bookmark "1" 2. Open a new bookmark, bookmark "2" Actual Results: Bookmark "2" loads in the same window/tab as bookmark "1" Expected Results: If preferences were set to "open bookmark in new window/tab", bookmark "2" would have been loaded in a new window/tab. This is the way it works in the IE skin MyIE2, and I like this option. But of course, this is only my opinion.</description>

In other words, such a script should be included in the distribution, and installed on /usr/bin or similar as the main Firefox command. There are a lot of variants of this script floating around on the Net; I'll attach a my very simple version of my own. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce:</description>

      <description>Request for enhancement (RFE): Option to open external links in a new tab in the same window. There are extensions to do this on Windows, but no Mac extensions other than Tabbrowser Extension, which does too much and causes other problems. This is a feature Camino and Safari already have and it is the only thing that is keeping Camino as my default browser rather than Firefox. If I open links from another program (Thunderbird, for example) I want a new tab in the existing window rather than a brand new window.</description>

Also, there are enough situations where you just can't go online and want to use eg. Firefox for local file viewing, or operating web local applications, only.

Could you please make such an extension or help me to make it myself? Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: Expected Results: Replace, say #ffaa00 by #00aaff.

      <title>Deferred Loading for "Open in Tabs"</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0; Q312461; ITC November 06, 2001 W2K Build) Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040707 Firefox/0.9.2 When I load multiple urls in firefox using the "Open in Tabs" Option in a bookmark folder OR by having multiple sites as the "home page"; firefox tries to load all the urls all at once Is it possible to have a gap between the requests for the urls. For e.g., if I have three sites in my bookmark folder/home page - mozilla.org, slashdot.org and google.com. Can the loading of the sites be performed per the following steps - 1. Create three tabs. 2. Load mozilla.org in the first tab. 3. Wait for 2 seconds. 4. Load slashdot.org in the second tab. 5. Wait for 2 seconds. 6. Load google.com in the 3rd tab. The actual implementation steps could be different, but the above is just an example of what I'm asking for. The amount of time could be more or less or customizable (default zero). The use - lesser load on my proxy server. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Add multiple sites to the "home page" with a '|' delimiter. 2. Load FireFox Actual Results: All sites loaded simultaneously. The requests go to the proxy server together. Expected Results: A slight lag between the requests to the proxy server.</description>

I know about the browser.chrome.favicons option, but that is a bit OTT as it kills favicons full stop. I find favicons useful when they sit on top of tabs, but when they are in the bookmarks (especially the personal toolbar folder) they add unnecessary clutter to the interface.

      <title>inconsistent keyboard shortcut handling while in text fields</title>

It seems that while the focus is in a text field, the text keyboard shortcuts take precendence over the application shortcuts. For example, CTRL+W will delete the last word typed, rather than close the current tab. This, I think, is fine in the HTML form fields, but I don't think this is correct behavior in the application text fields such as Location and Search. I'd love to see this be reversed for application text fields, or a hidden preference created for this. Or I could be way off base. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Put focus in location field. 2. CTRL+W Actual Results: Last word type deleted Expected Results: closed tab.</description>

It would be great if Firefox could save a current session of multiple open tabs, it only needs to save the urls of all the tabs on a file, so I can later open that file and restore all of that tabs. That is usefull becouse I sometimes open a lot of sites and dont bookmark them (when I am looking for information and dont decide myself about what sites to bookmark yet). A saved sessions manager would be good to. I dont speak english, so this message could be terrible spelled, sorry if that is the case. And thank for doing such a great software.

      <title>Middle Click "Back" and "Forward" buttons should jump to next domain</title>

Opera introduce "Fast-Forward" and "Rewind" buttons to the browser genre in version 7.5, which performs this functionality. While powerful and useful, it does require additional buttons be present on the toolbar. Since Firefox is already encouraging the use of "middle click" (close tab, for example), it would make sense to extend middle-click (alternate click) functionality to other parts of the UI. There is an extension available for FX which mimicks the Opera 'extra buttons' implementation. Forward is arguably less useful than Domain-Back, but if implemented should be provided for consistancy, even if it were used more rarely. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: Expected Results: Jumping back and forward by entire domain is useful when browsing forums and blogs, and most types of site. Consider searching Google for a type of page. You'd click on the top match, check out the site, but might look at a good number of pages before deciding to jump back to your starting place. Rather than multiple clicks on the Back arrow, or choosing the back drop down, a single middle click is both faster and intuitive for users introduced to using the middle button by other Firefox functionality.</description>

Disable textbox (and tracking) Toggle ON: 1. Enable Textbox (and tracking) 2. Restore value from previous entry OR an easier (code change wise) solution: Toggle ON: 1.

But having an optional installer without this would be nice. The real problem I have are users that upgrade themselves and then don't know what the heck Talkback is and think it's spyware or something and I support a few too many users like this.

Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Download a plain text file or image from a webserver or script which does not issue a content-type header Actual Results: When downloading a file from a broken server or script which does not issue content-types correctly (or not at all) Firefox will display the "Open" dialog, giving "Open with" or "Save to disk" as the options. Expected Results: Either as a third option, or within "Open with" it would be nice to specify firefox itself as the viewer. By which I mean the file would open in the current firefox window/tab, or a new tab/window (make that configurable I guess). It is a pain to have to launch an image viewer just to render a jpeg because of a broken web-browser, or to have to save a plain text file to disk merely to read it. In a lot of cases, the downloader is aware that firefox would be fully able to view the file (ie is an image, text or whatever) and such a feature would greatly help alleviate the frustration caused by broken servers and scripts.</description>

THE PROBLEM IN CURRENT SEARCH When search is started at the top of page, the found text and other lines around it can be seen. When the search falls of the page, the only thing that is visible, is the last line at the bottom of page. That's where the search stops, if matches are found. The problem is that no consequtive lines are visible. In mailing lists' theaded pages as well as in other pages, it is desirable to be able to see text before and after the found position. At current situation, the page needs to be scrolled every time to see what would would follow - to be able to determine if THIS is the location where I want to stop. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Go to top of page 2. Edit =&gt; Find in this page 3. Search any text that appears in page 4. The search is eventually positioned at the last line of page Actual Results: No lines that would follow are visible.</description>

      <title>Enhanced "Back"/"Forward" drop down menus (add "Rewind"/"Fastforward" function</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040830 Firefox/0.9.1+ Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040830 Firefox/0.9.1+ Following bug: 257918, which was quite reasonably "WONTFIX"'d for reasons of middle-click consistancy, I've been toying with a 'nice' way of implementing "Back to previous domain" type functionality (or "Rewind"/"Fast-forward" buttons in Opera). Since extra buttons add clutter, such functionality could be added as follows: (Testing the functionality can be found by either trying out a recent Opera release with "Rewind" and "Fast-Forward" buttons or alternatively is described in Bug #257918). Current the dropdown menu on "Back" and "Forward" offer a list of all past sites. At the top of this menu, separated from the list of 'all recent sites' could be added a "Back to previous domain" menu option. Ideally this option caption would changed to "Back to google.com" (in cases where Google was the last domain visited). The current full list would follow underneath. See the attached picture for a really rough example. In this example I've put the 'immediate' back page at the top, then the 'previous domain', and the current full list is underneath the separator marked "History". Err, "Discuss"...?

      <title>middle clicking "Open in Tabs" does nothing.</title>
      <description>Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040902 Firefox/1.0 PR Middle-clicking (and presumably accel-clicking) bookmarks in the Bookmarks menu and personal toolbar opens the selected bookmark in a new tab (and presumably a new window, depending on prefs). However, middle-clicking the "Open in Tabs" item simply destroys the menu. No pages are loaded in the current or new tabs. Expected behavior, I think, would be to create new tabs for the items in the folder and load them all (as opposed to "overwriting" the current tabs).</description>

      <title>No inline autocomplete in Firefox</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040803 Firefox/0.9.3 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040803 Firefox/0.9.3 The autocomplete in the address bar has a problem. It lacks the inline autocomplete feature. This would mean that (optionally) the first URL in the autocomplete dropdown list is automatically pasted in the address bar, making it unnecessary to use the mouse. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Turn on autocomplete for web addresses. 2. Start typing an address that you have previously visited. 3. This feature is available in the Mozilla App Suite.</description>

      <title>RFE: tool or extension to help with XUL accesskeys</title>
      <description>I would like to be able to run something that would go through Mozilla's XUL files and look for missing, duplicate or incorrect accesskeys. It could give a report and have a checkbox next to each item that would allow automatic fixing. Maybe something like: For context menu: Fix? [ ] "Use Current Page" button, missing accesskey Recommend _u_ [ ] "De_l_ete current item, should not use lowercase l (too thin) (recommend _c_) [ ] "_C_opy email address" and "_C_opy location" have duplicate accesskey (recommend Co_p_y location) Ideally it would be able to work with any XUL project. Maybe instead of a report it could just show the screen/menu in question and highlight the problems and put the errors as tooltips. It would be as automated, smart and flexible as possible, and try to follow the guidelines at http://www.mozilla.org/access/accesskey At the end it could create a patch file for you, submit the bug, get reviews, check it in, put another item in your status report and make you coffee :)</description>

Currently one can have several separate feeds bookmarked in a folder, but then one has to look at each folder separately in order to see new items. One solution is to allow multiple URLs as the "Feed Location(s)", similar to the Home Page option. Another solution is to allow OPML files to be used as live bookmarks; OPML would then have to be parsed. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

      <title>make bookmarks sidebar more link-ish and less manager/tree-ish</title>
      <description>Bookmarks in the sidebar behave mostly like links. This is a great feature and should be polished up and improved by removing the few manager-like bits from the sidebar. Todo: 1. remove the ability to "select" a row in the tree. 2. disable those manager functions like copy and delete for "selected" bookmarks. 3. style the bookmark items like links since that's what they are. You'll still be able to perform management in the sidebar, just a bit less conveniently (drag and drop will still work, context menus are available for edit functions, etc.) but the usability of the bookmarks themselves will be greatly enhanced and much less confusing.</description>

I think it would be a feature addition, a nice one, and would satisfy everyone to add a page in the custom installation process to select what kind of toolbar settings the user wants ... could be something like "Firefox is highly customizable, so is its toolbar, blablabla right click blabla What toolbar arrangement do you want by default: (x) Firefox Default UI; light and functional ( ) Internet Explorer UI; anyone switching from IE will find it easier with this ( ) Opera UI; Lots of buttons, without the banners ( ) Minimal UI; self-explicit etc.etc.etc." I don't think it would be long to add and I think that would be a good move from the team to show respect to old users who got in firefox a while ago, and also offers easier transition to other type of browser (opera, kmeleon, seakmonkey, whatever) Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce:</description>

What this means is that certain main toolbar buttons, probably just "Back" and "Bookmarks" have text labels beside them, and the rest of the toolbar is icons-only. Internet Explorer has this option, and it's more useful than it seems at first. Even as a "power user", I used this option when I was using IE because it aids the clickability of the buttons that are most used on the toolbar. Fitts' Law and all that (the classic reference: http://www.asktog.com/columns/022DesignedToGiveFitts.html). See also: http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/djst/archives/006398.html.

      <title>add &lt;title&gt; attribute to search engine icon in searchbar</title>
      <description>I made a copy of a.o. Google search to search via the dutch server (www.google.nl), which gives preference to dutch results above english. The icon does not leave much room to play with (16x16p) so the next best thing is to change &lt;search name="Google NL" in my googleNL.src it would be very usefull if the icon would get a &lt;title&gt; attribute so that I can instantly see which google engine I am using if i hoover over it. When you use e.g. babelfish for translations between various lingoes there is even more need for some sort of (visual) discrimination.</description>

The pop-up blocker already does this. Security lock kind of does. RSS and style-switcher need them too. Ideally, the icons should have extra attention brought to them the first time they appear, maybe by flashing, showing and arrow, etc. The message could be in either a dialog or in an info bar. RSS should say something like: This web site offers its content as a feed. Feeds can be added to your bookmarks as a live bookmark using the icon in the status bar. [RSS icon] _Read more about Live Bookmarks_ [link to appropriate section in help]. Style Switcher: This web site is available in more than one visual style. The style may be changed by using this icon in the status bar. [AltSS icon] _Read more about Style Switching_ [link to appropriate section in help]. All these dialogs should have a "[ ] Show this message every time" that defaults unchecked. The security lock icon should be incorporated into the security.warn_entering_secure dialog so that the correlation between the icon and security is made. The dialog should also be edited to mention that the site's domain is shown next to the lock. I somehow doubt it's possible to get all these strings in before PR, but I think this would be a win for newbies/novices. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce:</description>

It often happens to me that I try to click a link with middle mouse button to open that page in new tab, but instead I click few pixels away from the link; then instead of opening the right page in new tab, Firefox tries to open some non-existing page in the current tab. I don't use the function "open in current tab the page which URL is currently in clipper", and I use the function "open link in new tab" very often, so I'd like to turn off the former, because these situations like described above annoy me a bit ... Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. click middle mouse button somewhere on a web page (not on a link) Actual Results: Firefox tries to load a page which URL is equal to text which is currently copied into clipper. Expected Results: Some people may like this behaviour, but I'd like to be able to disable it - middle mouse button click would then work only on links, and if you click elsewhere - it wouldn't do anything at all.</description>

I consider problem areas as Web Search command under Tools menu as well as the Mail tie-ins to thunderbird (Many people may not have, and it's annoying). Also, if I have a FF 0.9 open and try and run 1.0RC (double click 'FF1.0RC' .exe, 0.9 opens instead. On the plus side, extensions update checking seems more stable and the browser seems to be at a good point (other than above) to release FF as 1.0 (meaningful only to non-techies I spose) Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3. Expected Results: Remove the offending entries from the crowded tools menu, they aren't applicable to everyone and I don't think another websearch feature is necessary. FF was originally built for speed and responsiveness.</description>

For example: example/~foo Ctrl-Enter should go to: http://www.example.com/~foo . In addition to "/", some other characters should be split away from the domain, like "?" or "#". For example: somewiki?BugZilla Shift-Enter should become: http://www.somewiki.net/?BugZilla Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce:</description>

      <description>For easier pop-up allowing/blocking it would be usefull to show an (to be designed) icon (+ contextmenu) in the statusbar in case popups are allowed. It would make it much easier to block them on a site that has pop-ups allowed (in case you change your mind). The delete url method via Options menu is not very practical.

      <title>Set Firefox icon for Start Menu &gt; Programs &gt; Mozilla Firefox folder</title>
      <description>I just have an idea of how to make Firefox (and other Mozilla products) easier to find (more visible) in Start Menu &gt; Programs listing. I don't know if it works in other versions of Windows, but it does in Windows XP. A user can set properties of a Start Menu folder for Firefox shortcuts. If you right click on a folder and select Properties, then you can switch to Customize tab. At the buttom you have an option to change the folder icon. Now you can select Firefox icon and this icon is then shown for Firefox folder on Start Menu. What this does is it creates a hidden file in this folder which is named "Desktop.ini". And the file has this contents: [.ShellClassInfo] IconFile=D:\Programs\Firefox\firefox.exe IconIndex=0 Maybe Firefox installer could automatically create such a file to set an icon for Firefox folder.</description>

IE and OE have this functionality, as well as Pegasus Mail. In my office, idle dialup connections add substantially to the phone bill. Windows does not accept a hangup timeout of less than 3 minutes. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Start firefox 2. Browse the Web 3. Exit firefox Actual Results: Connection stays idle for a number of minutes, until timeout is reached. In fact, sometimes it takes even much longer than that. Expected Results: If Firefox (and Thunderbird, too, of course) would terminate the connection immediately upon exit/going offline would save us real money.</description>

When you are using thin clients and remote display there isn't the "feedback" of a spinning hard drive to alert you that it's loading. FireFox takes about 5 seconds to come up, and users expect some kind of feedback that they have launched and clicked correctly and are clicking on it two and three times. (ack!). It should probably be off by default, but let me turn it on to make them feel better. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

This request is in some ways a generalization of Bug 249801 - that one only deals with passwords whereas this one also covers bookmarks, form data, cookies etc. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

In the settings dialog, when you click a category, it doesn't switch to the category until you RELEASE the mouse button. It feels much more responsive if it switches when you PRESS it. The same thing goes for the tabs in the "view page info" window. The current behaviour of mozilla doesn't match the behaviour in any other system that has tabs, such as microsoft windows or gnome tabs.

      <title>Mail button could use separate drop down arrow for its menu, while its main function could be "Read Mail"</title>

I believe the drop down arrow could be separated, so that the button has a default action when clicked, like the Back/Forward buttons. The main action could probably be "Read Mail" (that is, "open mail application"), which is, in my opinion, the most common thing one wants to do with a "Mail" button. This way one click less is required for this common action. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

Many IE converts miss that feature of IE, and may even switch back to it. Firefox should have a similar feature. A "pin" icon can be used to flag always visible, or auto-hide. When it's hidden, it'll only appear when the mouse goes over to the side of the screen, just like IE6. This could actually be a useful feature when not in full-screen mode, as well.

You click and change the options, including adding that site to the white list. This is different from the pop up blocker, which lets you temporarily allow pop ups right from the message bar (not sure of the proper name) or go in and always allow those pop ups. I'd rather temporarily allow a site to install a piece of software than either disallowing it or always allowing it. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Go here: http://ieview.mozdev.org/installation.html 2. Click on the install link 3. The notification bar pops up and tells you the install was blocked. 4. Click the bar and it gives you a menu, one of the choices is to change the settings for allowed sites. There is no option to temporarily allow an install. Actual Results: Could not temporarily allow the install. Expected Results: There should be an option to temporarily allow the site to install software.</description>

Apple's Safari has this feature and proves a big help, especialy for those with low net speeds. A cache clear option could be placed in the file menu, and a history clear option could be placed at the bottom of the "Go" menu. This will save users a whole lot of time when wanting to speed up their browsers, instead of having to pull up the preferences and navigate through them every time they want to clear cache or history. You may or may not want to add conframation alert boxes each time these functions are activated.

      <title>Method to Rename Custom Toolbars (Without Having to Edit "localstore.rdf")</title>

If you want to rename it afterwards, the only way to do so is to look for your profile's "localstore.rdf" file, find the &lt;RDF:Description /&gt; tag that has the toolbar name you want to change, and change it there. Would it be possible to have a simpler method of renaming toolbars? One possible idea for this would be the addition of a "Rename Toolbar" button in the window which allows the user to add/remove toolbar icons. When the user clicks on it, a window is brought up with four items: 1) A drop-down box, which will contain the names of all custom toolbars they currently have created - The one they want to rename will be the one that is selected. 2) A one-line input box, which will be used to input the new name for the toolbar. 3/4) "OK" and "Cancel" buttons, used to complete the renaming of the toolbar, or to back out of renaming it (respectively). This would make it much easier for users to rename their toolbars, without having to look around for (and edit) their profile's "localstore.rdf" file.

      <title>Cannot set location of disk cache</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.23; Mac_PowerPC) Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040913 Firefox/0.10 Firefox for Mac OS X has never had an option to set the location of the cache folder. I have a separate scratch volume which I use for browser caches. I would like to be able to create a folder for Firefox on that volume and set a preference within Firefox to have it use that location. This would protect my data volume for all the read/write hits that occur while surfing. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. check preferences 2. there is an option to set the size of the cache but not the location. 3. cache folder is written into user's home folder. Expected Results: Need a preference to allow setting the location of the cache folder onto any mounted volume, like in Mozilla.</description>

      <title>UI for pref to disable sound on Find As You Type</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040913 Firefox/0.10 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040913 Firefox/0.10 There's currently no preference in the Options/Accessibility dialog to disable the sound for Find As You Type. The preference name (as seen in about:config) is "accessibility.typeaheadfind.enablesound". I'd like a preference added to the dialog, because I find the sound annoying and unnecessary, given the toolbar now indicates the search status with colour and a description. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3. Actual Results: No preference under Tools, Options, Advanced, Accessibility for disabling the sound effect.</description>

      <title>provide timestamp with cookie exceptions</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040911 Firefox/0.10 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040911 Firefox/0.10 When you start browsing with disabled cookies, you always find web sites that absolutely require a cookie. Then you go to the cookie exception dialog and want to find the website that you are browsing to allow one cookie. Unfortunately, this common task is quite tedious to achieve. A normal user is going to have 100 of sites listed here. A first solution is to provide a search dialog but this is the object of another bug report. A second solution which does not overlap with the first one would be to keep a timestamp of every site trying to set-up a cookie.That way, you would just sort the list by timestamp and the first one is the site you just tried to access. You disable it and that's ok. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

      <title>Errors on other tabbed pages interrupts viewing on active tab</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040913 Firefox/0.10 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040913 Firefox/0.10 Situation: When using two more more tabs, it is possible to be entering text into one active tabbed page whilst loading other tabbed pages in the background. However, if an inactive tabbed page has an error like a 404 error or some components on that page cannot be loaded, Firefox produces a pop-up box error message. This is OK however it is very intrusive since it interrups what a user is doing on an active tabbed page. Subsequently, the tab with an error on it becomes the active tab, forcing the user to OK the error message and revert back to his original page to continue his work. Wouldn't it be nice if the user didn't have to respond to every Firefox error message if it wasn't urgent? Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. CTRL + T for new tab 2. CTRL + T for new tab again 3. Load one web page like www.slashdot.org in first tab - Press Enter. Wait for page to load 4. In other tab, load up a webpage with error on it or one with 404 error 5. Try to go back to slashdot tab and see how long it takes before Firefox interrupts your viewing to tell you the other tab had an error on it i.e. "The page you are trying to view cannot be loaded" pop up box appears. Have to OK this before proceeding. Expected Results: If a 404 error had occured in the other tab, the tab with the error on it should either appear a different colour like Red allowing the user to tackle the error notification in his own time.</description>

Though, in the page context menu you can start downloading a file using "Save link as". That action on the menuitem opens up the "Save as" common dialog enabling the user to specify a different folder for storing downloaded file. I suggest that a new action be added in the context menu, to directly start downloading to the default folder, bypassing the "save as" dialog. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

This is one of the most helpful features in Mozilla. (And not quite as important, but I for one think that the separate history window instead of a sidebar was way cool, and would like to see that as a configurable option. But I'm sure that's complicated.) Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

      <title>Allow tabs to be transferred to other FireFox windows (frames)</title>

The context (right-click) menu could contain a cascading-menu item called "Send to Window" which would then pop open to the names of the other currently available windows. Of course, if there are no other windows, either the "Send to Window" option is grayed out, or (preferred) it only contains the selection "New Window" (which, further, could exist regardless of other windows being open). I know this RFE may seem a little esoteric, but FireFox is starting to allow us powerbrowsing that is simply annoying to attempt or non-existent in IE.

      <title>identify unread live bookmark items</title>
      <description>Live bookmarks should identify unread items -- e.g. making them bold or similar. We know when an item is unread by checking 1) the items LastVisitDate (which won't be set on new items, also will get cleared when the livemark is reloaded); 2) by checking history. These are the same operation, and this will get much easier when we coalesce history and bookmarks post-1.0.</description>

      <title>Ability to Select multiple tabs by clicking and dragging</title>

However, I don't like to close some of the tabbed view one by one. I suggest the following enhancement: user can select a group of consequtive tabs and close all of them together. My proposed operation would be: 1. User opened serveral tabbed browser window. 2. As tabbed browser windows for one topic would be gathered, user can select a group of tabbed browser windows by left-clicking the first desired tabbed browser windows (to mark the start position) and moving the mouse rightwards while still keeping down the left mouse button to select other tabbed browser windows. 3. After the selection, user can then right-click to get the pop-up menu and select "close Tab" to close all the above selected browser windows. By allowing user to close a group of tabbed browser windows, it will greatly speed up the UI operation and bring more convenience. Reproducible: Didn't try Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

Even worse, the logo on my desktop is obscured by the Firefox window! I am sad about this as are all of my friends (both of them). After his great work on the project logos, I feel it is a travesty of great proportions that a Hicks theme does not exist within the product. *tear* Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open Firefox 2. Look for a Jon Hicks designed theme 3. Fail to find one 4. Feel sad Actual Results: Sense of emptyness. I was left wishing Jon Hicks had design a Firefox theme. Expected Results: Sense of fulfilment. My desktop should have been enlivened by a Hicks Design Firefox theme. Everybody knows that freelance developers cannot afford to always work for free. I suggest that the Mozilla Organisation sets aside a small sum of cash to commision Jon Hicks to design a new theme set for Firefox. If necessary could we set up a fund for donations just to this cause. I know a large number of fans of Jon's work and I'm sure they'd all contribute something. I know I would.</description>

      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1) Build Identifier: Firefox 0.9.3 Don't get me wrong.... firefox rocks! I prefer it to IE in most ways. However my only complaint is that it starts slower (like say 2-3 seconds for firefox rather than &lt;1 second for IE). Not a lot of time but heck it should be instantaneous! Any way to achieve faster start times? Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Click firfox icon 2. The second startup is quicker 3. The third startup is quick too. Its just that first load time. I wonder if you can't solve this, maybe if you "preload" firefox somewhere when the computer starts, if it is the default browser...at least this gives the "apprarance" of starting really fast when clicked then.</description>

      <title>There should be a new tab button at the left of the tab bar</title>

It is very annoying that there isn't a "New tab" button in Firefox, like there is in Mozilla, this was a very useful feature. I am aware that there is an extension to bring back this functionality (although I couldn't get it to install), but I suggest it use put in as a standard feature again. Even better, would be to make the tab bar behave like any other toolbar, that way, the actual tabs part of the tab bar can be just a toolbar component that can be moved around according to the user's needs. Then they can also add other buttons to the tab bar as they see fit also. If they want a new tab button, they can put it there, if they dont, they can take away. The same goes for the close tab button. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open Firefox 2. Look at the tab bar, there is no "New tab" button like in Mozilla Actual Results: There is no "New tab" button Expected Results: There should be a "New tab" button</description>

      <title>behave-like-IE extension as default, to stop mutilation of Firefox-program</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040913 Firefox/0.10 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040913 Firefox/0.10 I don't like to see Firefx becoming more and more mutilated to just behave like IE. - In bug 259362, for example there the feature to open the PageInfo-window for webpages with full-size java applets ore flash animations has been given up to just have a short cut like IE. Now, one function ine Firefox has 2 short cuts, the other none. - In bug 257411 comment #5 the feature to delete multiple history items is given up to just be like IE. bug 217472 comment #30. I guess there are much more such examples. I think a better solution would be to add a simple extension that applies such IE-behaviours. This extension may be included to Firefox download and activated by default. But advanced users could uninstall (or just dectivate) this extension. So there would be no need anymore to mutilate Firefox. Things that should be IE-like for users who switched from IE to Firefox could be changed in this extension, not in the Firefox-program anymore!

      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8a4) Gecko/20040925 Build Identifier: Firefox 1.0 PR Storing Favicons in the local copy of the bookmarks file is a good idea. However, favicons should not be stored in exported bookmark files, since it adds a lot to file size unnecessarily. Eg A list of bookmarks 124kb when exported from Mozilla became 284kb when exported from Firefox. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Visit many sites in your bookmarks which have favicons 2. Export the bookmarks file 3. Gawk at how gigantic the bookmarks file is Actual Results: Humongous sized bookmarks file Expected Results: Decent sized bookmarks file, lean and sans icon-information</description>

(I believe it was still in some earlier versions of phoenix or firefird) With Mozilla 1.6x 1.7x etc. you can click the middle mouse button and open a new browser window. Tabs are nice but I would like the option to set the middle mouse button to open a whole new browser window instead. I'm aware that you can do this (with 2 steps) using the right click, and select "Open Link in New Window", but I miss middle-clicking a link to get a new browser window. Is there a way to configure this now with Firefox? (I haven't been able to find it) thanks Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

The only method I could find was: http://kb.mozillazine.org/index.phtml?title=Firefox_:_FAQs_:_Uninstall_Search_Plugins ... which is not particularly user-friendly. Considering that uninstalling engines is probably quite quite common (when I've installed Google UK the main Google engine plugin will be useless and potentially confusing), I think it would be helpful to add a 'Delete Engines...' to the drop-down that appears in the search box on the toolbar. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3. This might well depend on bug #259060 being resolved first.</description>

Maybe it could just be a command-key with no menu item to clog-up the UI, or a UI option in about:config. What it would do is re-open the last tab you closed. I've mistakenly closed tabs before and I've observed it quite a few times with others using the browser. the frustration of losing a tab because you got 'trigger-happy' on ctrl-w is something I'd rather not live with. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Close a tab. 2. Realize that you wanted to go back from it. 3. Smack forehead and try to get back to where you were. Actual Results: There is no way to just reincarnate that tab. Expected Results: I SHOULD be able to do ctrl-option-w and reincarnate the tab.</description>

This is great, but on the other hand there is not visual feedback of blocked images. Firefox just leaves the part of the web page blank. This leads to unnecessary bug reports, and questions about the quality of the software or network. We are all human and often forget, that we intentionally disabled the display. It also makes it much easier to enable the images loading for certain images on demand, when we know that there is an image on the page. The browser does not even display the alternative text for blocked images. How about some kind of grey shaded area in right image size including an overlay of the alternative image text? Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Use remore images on an web page, use alt in img tag 2. Block image server or enable feature "allow only images from originating web page" 3. View page and decide, whether a visual feedback of the blocked image would be nice or not Actual Results: Once during search for a potential defect, but is was my fault. Expected Results: Display a grey area with alternative image text as overlay.</description>

      <title>GUI configuration of items in about:config, especially print settings</title>

In particular, print settings are giving me grief on our network. Firefox defaults to 'Letter' sized print jobs, which locks our ( admittedly **** ) printers. To combat this, I enter about:config, filter on the string 'print', select print.postscript.paper_size and replace 'Letter' with 'A4'. This is just an example ( the most relevant example for us ). There are many more items in here that really should have a friendly GUI tool for setting. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Enter URL about:config 2. Pretend you're a typical user Actual Results: Presented with a LONG list of options - some of which were mildly interesting, others which were quite important, and yet more which I couldn't figure out at all. Expected Results: I'd like to see the more everyday-type options have a GUI config tool. I don't mind these settings showing up in about:config as well, as long as there is an easy configuration method.</description>

Piotr Komoda &lt;gorky@neo.pl&gt; reported Having translated about:mozilla and about:buildconfig pages requires from us (localizers) to "hack" toolkit.jar and change mozilla.xhtml and buildconfig.html in \global. Now, when the whole build process of localized official releases is covered by mozilla.org, we can't do this modification. Besides, even draft of trademark policy doesn't allow us to do so. The easiest way to solve the problem and (by the way) to make L10n teams life easier is to let us translate contents of those abouts via .dtd or .properties files, just like in about:plugins case.... And Benjamin Smedberg &lt;bsmedberg@covad.net&gt; commented So I'm happy to create a patch for about:mozilla (it's mostly done in my tree), but about:buildconfig isn't going to happen (besides, if you're geeky enough to read about:buildconfig, you're gonna have to know the English word for "compiler" anyway).

I don't know how to code, but I hope you'll like this idea and make it real. I'd love to have a feature in Firefox that would enable me to enter a new mode, in which links I click remain in a list accessible by a menu (if I want to edit it for any reason). That mode would be previously configured so that I could specify the format of the news URL and the format of the "print this page" URL. In this way, the links would pass by a search and replace operation. Then, I'd have the possibility to fullscreen a slideshow with all the URLs in the list I built by clicking with that mode on. By using left/right on the keyboard, I'd easily browse back and forward, like if I was reading in an old microfilm system in a library. Up and down would move the doc up and down smoothly. Eventually it would be nice to force a cache for this operation so the sites aren't unnecesarily overloaded with forward/back (Depends on how it's built, I know). Then, I'd have some keys available in the fullscreen, with the possibility of doing simple automated macros. For things like: 1. Saving in a format as IE's "mht" preserving all the visual 2. Printing immediately with a predefined color/bw/quality 3. Saving as in number 1 but naming the file from the mouse-selected text instead of the document title 4. All these mixed 5. Any thing you can also imagine :) This will speed up my news browsing like hours a week. I always print to read offline, and this would be a huge upgrade, for what I use a browser :) Thanks in advance guys. And congratulations for this amazing project!

      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040913 Firefox/0.10 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040913 Firefox/0.10 When closing the main window with tabs open, Firefox warns me that I might be about to do something unpractical. Rather than the warning (or as an alternative), I'd prefer that it remembers the set of open pages for my next session and opens them again. This would be similar to any decent desktop metaphor (Apple is great at this), and is plain practical. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open several tabs in the browser window. 2. Close Firefox. It will warn me that I'll close several tabs, rather than giving me the option to remember them for next session. 3. Open Firefox again. I get my start page, not the set of pages I was using. Actual Results: Firefox opens on my start page, not the set of pages I was viewing in the last session. Expected Results: Have Firefox remember the set of pages I was viewing. Could be made optional for all I care. Opera does this, and has me hooked...</description>

Rather, it should be incorporated into one of tabs in Tools | Page Info, as one of detailed properties of a page object. If Page Info stays under Tools menu (contrary to Bug 240384), then View | Page Source shouldn't be under View menu. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce:</description>

In all occasions you are forced to hit "Browse" or manually type the full path to the file. It would be an excellent enhancement to allow a file to be dragged from an open folder or the desktop, onto a File input form control and for Firefox to get the path to that file and insert it into the form. Currently an 'unavailable' cursor appears when files are dragged over these controls. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

      <title>about:config should be reachable thru the Tools:Options UI</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040803 Firefox/0.8 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040803 Firefox/0.8 Getting at the usefulness of the "about:config" screen shouldn't require the user, even the advanced user, to remember the exact "about:..." URL to enter. (Can you tell I just spent a while fumbling around for "about:preferences" and "about:prefs" and "about:options" and "about:opts", "about:*" and whatnot?) I suggest putting an option on the Tools:Options:Advanced pane -- maybe call it "Raw Preferences View" or something -- that would bring up the "about:config" screen. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. SMS all your friends asking if they remember what the magic Firefox thing is that brings up all the preferences, because you can't remember "about:config" or find it in any of the menus or in the Tools:Options UI. 2. When none respond, try typing "about:preferences" or the like, since you know it's something like that. 3. Stare pathetically into space as exactly /nothing/ happens when you enter "about:preferences", etc Actual Results: Shame spiral. Crying. Bonghits. Expected Results: I'd have looked in the Tools:Options UI, selected Advanced, seen something like "Raw Preferences View", clicked it, and gotten what is currently accessible only by remembering the magic URL "about:config". Then I would have been happy, and had cake.</description>

The bare "about:" screen should have links to all of them. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Type in "about:" 2. Note lack of links to anything else 3. Sigh with disappointment Actual Results: Ennui. Expected Results: I'd have seen links to about:plugins, about:cache, about:buildconfig, about:config, and whatever else there is that I don't know about -- maybe even about:mozilla and about:blank.</description>

Then there's no way to get the tab back. To be more specific I was downloading a document to view in one tab and reading something in the other tab. I finished reading the other tab and shut it - had a brain spasm and accidentally clicked twice. Now I can't get that document back without re-downloading.

In Mozilla the Proxy Autoconfig was set to file://home/&lt;user&gt;/proxy.pac Firefox imported the Mozilla settings, but it fails to find the PAC file because of the file:// prefix instead of the file:/// this failure is completely silent and Firefox fails to use the corerct proxy settings as a result. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3. Actual Results: file://home/&lt;user&gt;/proxy.pac does not work file:///home/&lt;user&gt;/proxy.pac works The failure is silent - the broser accepts the file location and does not warn the user about not being able to access it. Expected Results: Warn the user when a PAC file can not be loaded. Add a "browse" butoon next to the text entry line for the PAC location to let users select and enter the proper local file.</description>

Now that FireFox has crossed the 1.0 line, would it be possible to try to build it for MacOS 9.x ? 50% of apple users are still on those machines. I know that it's an obscure system, but I thought maybe when you hit the milestone, you could drop us a few crumbs. I use FireFox everywhere in the universe except at home. How portable is that code anyway...? Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

      <title>Always show host name in status bar (anti-spoofing)</title>
      <description>With the demise of the always-on location bar we once again have no anti-spoofing/anti-phishing story. Possible solution: expand the SSL hostname thing to show the host name all the time. If it's important to distinguish between secure "we know this for a fact" hostnames vs "if you trust DNS" host names we could bold the secure hosts and/or add a background field.</description>

Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Hold down the command and option keys. 2. In a Firefox browser window, click the pill-shaped show/hide toolbar button in the top-right of the window. 3. Release the command and option keys. Actual Results: When the toolbar is visible, it hides the toolbar. When the toolbar is not visible, it shows the toolbar. Expected Results: It should open the user interface to customize the toolbar. I am using the default Firefox 1.0PR theme for Mac OS X 10.2 Panther.

For an example screenshot in OmniWeb: http://www.omnigroup.com/images/images-5/features/tabs.png This should definitely be optional because the thumbnails take more space. I understand that this is an extreme request. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: In a new Firefox web browser window, pull the File menu down to New Tab.

Re-open Firefox. Actual Results: Firefox goes to Start Page. Expected Results: Firefox returns to state before quitting.</description>

Click on a link in some other Windows application while Firefox is open. Actual Results: Firefox opens a new window. There's no option to change that behaviour. Expected Results: Create a new tab. I get a ton of Firefox icons in the process bar, I would prefer to have just one window and a bunch of tabs in there. Opera has this right.</description>

A common task is for me to open a new tab, then click on the Home button. Adding this feature would eliminate one step. This concept could possibly be carried to other buttons as the toolbar becomes more customizeable. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.CTRL+click or SHIFT+click on the Home button in the toolbar Actual Results: The home page opens in the current tab or window instead of a new one, as one might expect. Expected Results: Open the home page in a new tab or window, depending on the key held.</description>

And only if that fails, Firefox should say that "Life bookmark failed to load". That should probably be done when adding it, so that we don't need to parse the whole webpage each and every time the browser is run. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: Run Firefox choose "Manage bookmarks", File &gt; New life bookmark... and enter a URL of the website of which you know to provide an "alternate" &lt;link&gt; element. Click OK and close bookmark manager open the bookmarks menu and scroll to the new life bookmark item Actual Results: The item either remains as "Life bookmark loading...", or says "Life bookmark failed to load" Expected Results: Firefox should detect an "alternate" &lt;link&gt; element, and follow it.</description>

      <title>Tabs toolbar should behave like every other toolbar</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040914 Firefox/0.10 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040914 Firefox/0.10 The tabs toolbar should behave like every other toolbar, in that it should be allowed to be hidden, and it should be customisable. This is related to bug 186865 in that it would allow for a new tab button to be placed on the tabs toolbar, but it is not a dupe because this bug doesn't specifically address the "New tab" button. If fixed this bug would provide the solution for bug 186865 though. There's really no logical reason I can think of for the tabs toolbar not to behave like any other toolbar.

It would be natural to be able to drag-and-drop a tab to a bookmark folder. Currently, only the opposite is possible: one may drag-and-drop a bookmark to a tab. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Select View-&gt;Sidebar-&gt;Bookmarks (Ctrl-b) or View-&gt;Toolbars-&gt;Bookmarks toolbar. 2. Go to one location, open File-&gt;New tab (Ctrl-t), and go to an another location. 3. Try to drag with mouse one of the tabs to a bookmark folder, either in Sidebar Bookmarks or Bookmarks toolbar, using any of the three mouse buttons. Actual Results: Nothing. Expected Results: 1. Pressing a mouse button over a tab would change the mouse cursor into a dragging cursor. 2. Dragging-and-dropping the cursor over a bookmark folder would cause a new bookmark to be appear to the folder.</description>

I have compassion on the poor user, who now must make an additional 100-200 unnecessary decisions each day. For simplicity, how about if Firefox does what MyIE2/Maxthon does by having a single text field for URLs and searches; that is: 1. Setting the default keyword.URL to a normal Google search 2. Dropping the search bar from the default UI setup Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce:</description>

Power users like to have many tabs open, but with the tab bar can quickly become crowded with the standard horizontal layout of tabs. I would like to suggest an idea which has already been implemented in Web browsers like Galeon and Opera: vertical tabs. Here, tabs would travel down the side of a window instead of across the top. The orientation of the text on the tabs would not be changed: it would still run from left to right. To facilitate this feature, there should also be some way to restrict tab widths to a fixed size, either in pixels or in characters. Here's an ASCII diagram: -------------------------- ----------| | Tab 1 | ----------| | Tab 2 | Web page ----------| | Tab 3 | ----------| | Tab 4 | ----------| | Tab 5 | ----------| -------------------------- Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce:</description>

Maybe this is a feature request rather than a bug report but I think it is so obvious that this is the desired behaviour that I consider it a major user interface issue. Of course there are ambiguous cases when multiple frames are loaded but when and where I can scroll a frame with the mouse wheel I certainly expect keyboard paging to work as well. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Load a frameset with navigation frame (e.g. http://towo.net/mined/) 2. Move mouse over main frame, scroll wheel: works, press PageDown: nothing 3. Click other frame from navigation area 4. Move mouse over main frame, scroll wheel: works, press PageDown: nothing Actual Results: keyboard control does not work Expected Results: should work searched bugs database for "focus", "focus active", "focus click", "no focus", "not focussed" - sorry if there is a duplicate that I didn't see in the long result lists</description>

      <title>Keyboard shortcuts seem to have changed recently e.g. CTRL-U seems to invoke page source</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040914 Firefox/0.10 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040914 Firefox/0.10 I have been using the keyboard shortcuts in mozilla and in firefox for a long time. Suddenly, without any apparent reason, they have changed, and I can't find any place to fix them. E.g. when typing in urls or filling in forms, I used to be able to use CTRL-U to delete to beginning of line. That now instead opens a new window showing the source for the current page, which I rarely need (and is available via right mouse button). CTRL-K used to delete to end of line, but now seems to 'tab' to next field. I presume there is some way I can change accelerators since the need for such flexibility in interfaces has been known for many years, but have found no information on how to change them. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. click on text in URL panel or form field 2. type CTRL-U Actual Results: Source for current page pops up. Expected Results: Delete to beginning of line. Similarly CTRL-K moves mouse cursor to next field, instead of deleting to end of line. An ideal solution would be to extend 'preferences' to allow a list of keyboard short-cuts to be edited.</description>

      <title>Current popup blocker implementation is too invasive / Themes and extensions</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040913 Firefox/0.10.1 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040913 Firefox/0.10.1 In the current implementation of popup blocking, the information that the popup has been blocked is displayed over the top of the current page as a yellow margin, apparently taking up space that belongs to the page. This might not be bad for everyone, but my preference is to have a small icon in the toolbar(?) at the bottom of the window. It would be nice if this kind of option could be modified as part of the browser "theme". Of course, since the specifics of the functionality of the popup blocker would have to change as well, this option would violate the rule that 'a theme can only control appearance, not functionality.'. I'm no expert, but my guess is that the solution is to implement the specifics of both appearance and function as user modifiable scripts, with 'theming' broken down into specific user interface functions that can arbitrarily hook into browser functions (e.g. buttons/icons could be added at will into the UI (not via extensions) which could hook into any functions the user wanted). Of course, this would break down the distinction between appearance and function that allows 'themes' to be separate from 'extensions', since every theme in place is designed for a specific set of functions, which would of course be different from browser to browser (given extensions, especially if extensions were made very easy for users to make/modify). This is a fundamental problem. Is anyone working on ideas of new ways of working around this problem? I would like the appearance of all functions, be they extensions or not, to be under the complete control of the user, this includes the appearance of the right-click context menu, etc. In any case, creating themes, and to limited extent, new functionality (via extensions and whatnot), should be part of the individual user experience. Because anything that might be considered a "specific detail of implementation" should in principle be accessible, and not 'hardcoded' into the browser or into extensions and themes, which are not well documented and don't seem to have user modifiability as a consideration in the implementation process. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. open a page which has popups / interact with user interface 2. 3. Actual Results: Loaded page was 'invaded' by popup blocker information Expected Results: Used the user interface instead as the means of displaying the information.</description>

      <title>Tab clutter causes confusion. Use Group Tabbed Browsing to enhance productivity. In principle, a group tab contains multiple other member tabs.</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041001 Firefox/0.10.1 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041001 Firefox/0.10.1 I'd like to propose an enhancement. Grouped Tabbed Browsing (GTB). The principle is simple: A group tab contains multiple other member tabs. Currently, I sometimes avoid tab clutter, by opening up a top level link in a new browser window (instead of a tab) and then tab browse within the new window. This window thus serves effectively as container (or a group tab) for a related set of tabs. This is a work around. IMO, a group tab solution, which seems like a logical progression, would be a more elegant approach. As illustrated below. Example scenario You come across a topic which you feel may have a lot of other related pages and you'd like to keep them together. You are on link number 1 and you decide that you'd like this to be part of its own group. Okay, so instead of middle-click, you do &lt;Some Key&gt;+Middle Click, and voila, it opens up in a new group tab. All subsequent middle clicks work as normal, opening up tabs in the background and automatically associating them with the current group tab. You want another group? No problems. &lt;Some Key&gt;+Middle Click... Clicking on one of multiple group tabs, would make it active and fill the browser window with all its member tabs. The other tabs would disappear into their group tab, thus reducing clutter and improving organization. The group tab could also be used to conveniently control all other members of the group. Say bookmark all pages of a group. Or close or save or maybe forward them all. One would need to think this entire thing through in more detail, but these are top of mind ideas.

Please add this column as well. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Choose Bookmarks ==&gt; Manage Bookmarks... 2. Go to the column selection tool above the right scrollbar and click on it. Actual Results: No choice is available for displaying the checkbox for "Load in sidebar". Expected Results: Want additional choice for "Load in sidebar" checkmark. Justification: Had I realized that the display of a web page in a sidebar was deliberate, I would not have filed bug https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=247229.</description>

      <title>keep browser in background (unfocused, unactivated) as new tabs are opened into it</title>
      <description>An option to force Firefox to remain on the background would be nice, that way you could just click all links (in a message, for example) and then switch to Firefox instead of clicking a link, switching the focus back to the email client after Firefox steals it, click another link etc. (By Timo Tolonen in bug 172962 comment 89.) I've attempted to set the Summary to catch as many duplicate bug filings as possible, since this request has popped up repeatedly in bugs in which it does not belong.</description>

It is impossible, however, to drag-and-drop one of these folders to another spot in the left pane, for example to move it inside of another folder or change the order of the folders. This works fine in the right pane, so it seems natural to expect it to work the same way on the left. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Bookmarks-&gt;Manage Bookmarks 2. Try to drag-and-drop a folder in the left pane to a different position Actual Results: Nothing happens. Expected Results: Move the folder just as you can in the right pane.</description>

      <title>need a way to preview livemark feeds before having to subscribe</title>
      <description>There is currently no way to see what the heck you are subscribing to when you select a livemark feed. For some sites (eg, http://www.electoral-vote.com/), it's not at all clear as to what sort of content is available in their feed. Not to mention most feeds are unhelpfully named "RSS". To simply just take a peek currently, you must: Select the livemark entry from the status bar icon. Choose a name and location to add it to your bookmarks. Click add. Navigate your bookmarks to the entry you've just created. Open the livemark, look at the item titles. If the title is ambiguous, select an item to see what actual URL is linked. Navigate again through the bookmarks tree to the livemark. Right click and delete it, assuming you were just curious what was available. There needs to be some way to preview a livemark feed. All that it needs to list is probably the title, maybe the image, and all items, including where they link to. Alternatively, instead of a separate preview function, the livemark list in the status bar could already be "live", such as: [livemark icon] \ title \ (loading...) \ item 1 \ item 2 \ ---------------------- \ subscribe to this feed Or something like that. This might even better expose to novice users what the heck that icon is for, as they would directly see the list of headlines or whatever content is being served.</description>

      <title>Shorten titles in multiple tabs to make them more useful/significant</title>

Taking yet another page from Apple's Safari... When there are multiple tabs in Safari which are pages from the same website, Safari will shorten the tab titles to make them more signficant by removing redundant portions, e.g. Yahoo! News' titles are "Yahoo! News - blah blah blah", but if there are multiple tabs showing Yahoo! News pages, then the tab titles will just show "blah blah blah", i.e. leaving out the "Yahoo! News - " part. This makes better use of the limited space in tabs to display a more significant title for the user. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Go to Yahoo! News. 2. Open a lot of news stories in tabs. 3. Actual Results: The tab titles retain the &lt;title&gt; of their containing web pages. Expected Results: Shorten the titles by leaving out redundant portions, e.g. "Yahoo! News - ".</description>

Many times, users who have problems will reinstall FF only to find that the exact same problem occurs again (because the problem was in the profile). If the installer sees an existing profile, it should pop up a message saying something like: "A previous user profile was found. This profile includes personal settings like bookmarks, passwords, and extensions. Do you wish to use it?" On that same screen, some options should be given: 1. Yes, use current profile (including extensions, themes) 2. Yes, use current profile (without extensions, themes) 3. No, create new profile Currently, #1 is what is done automatically without warning. Personally, I think #2 should be default in that it would copy the important stuff like bookmarks, passwords, etc without exposing most of the problems associated with extensions and themes. Option #3 should either rename the old profile or simply delete it. I personally like renaming it since it would keep people from accidentally deleteing their bookmarks. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Install FireFox. 2. Change a setting or add an extension. 3. Uninstall it. 4. Run installer again. 5. Setting or extension is still there.

These are done to get Firefox at the same speed and smoothness of IE, when really this should be the result anyhow. Unless other better ways to get the benefits of these changes can be done, I would put to you that the following is becoming increasingly popular, and a pain for simple users to have to do, many when Firefox does not run as with these changes, just go back to IE: browser.turbo.enabled - true general.smoothScroll - true network.image.imageBehavior - 0 network.http.max-connections - 48 network.http.max-connections-per-server - 16 network.http.pipelining - true network.http.pipelining.maxrequests - 100 network.http.proxy.pipelining - true Now create the following (right click add new): Boolean -- network.http.pipelining.firstrequest -- set to true Integer -- nglayout.initialpaint.delay -- set to 0 If some or all of these can be added it would have huge benefits and people would leave Firefox less, and instead promote it's speed and efficiency more. These settings really do seem to get the best out of Firefox, and the best should come a little more by default. I would at least request that when a user upgrades or re-installs (keeping profiles etc), that the settings remain the same, so you don't have to do it all over again AT LEAST.

Which means, when I make a search in Google, I prefer doing it in www.google.ch, because it allows me to fine up my search by searching only in swiss websites. The Google search bar in Firefox uses by default google.com. Of course, as many of us probably, I've modified the google.src file in the searchplugings folder, but I think it would be much simpler and cooler if this could simply be done by rightclicking on the "G" of Google in the search bar and choose which national google we want as default. Cool, no? Ant Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

      <title>Feature request: opening Tabs with addresses like Bookster</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; de-DE; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040803 Firefox/0.9.3 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; de-DE; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040803 Firefox/0.9.3 I'd like to request a feature. I have often the case to browse through galleries on the web and many of them are sorted by digits (like http://www.gallery.com/galleries/1/, http://www.gallery.com/galleries/2/). Now it is very intricating to change the address every time in the address bar manually. Bookster uses tags like {1-10} or {01-10} which will be then extended to like http://www.gallery.com/gallery/01/, .../02/ and so on. This feature should open the extended URLs in seperate tabs in the browser window. I know that this feature request is more for an extension but since I'm not involved in programming I thought it might be good to introduce it somewhere.

      <title>Import Wizard prompts for import of settings on first launch in no profiles already exist.</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041004 Firefox/0.10.1 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041004 Firefox/0.10.1 When launching Firefox when no profiles are created, the Import Wizard runs. It would be nice if a preference could be created in C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\greprefs\all.js or another file that could shut off importing of new settings. When we deploy firefox we change the C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\defaults\profile\prefs.js file to allow a profile to be created with a random name for security. However when Firefox is first ran the Import Wizard shows up and this is undesirable behavior. We a single mandatory roaming profile for our labs on campus and therefore everytime the user logs off they and logged back on they are getting the import wizard. I could capture the settings in the profile, which I am currently doing, however it would be nice if our staff users were also not presented with this wizard. If there is currently a preference I do not know about can someone please point it out? I have queried bugzilla and mozillazine and could not find an answer. As there is no attachment for Ben's fix on bug https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=240136 I cannot see what happened. Besides I am not a programmer and would probably not help anyway. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.None 2. 3. Actual Results: Firefox displays an Import Wizard when run while no profiles are installed. Expected Results: After setting a preference, Firefox should not show the Import Wizard.</description>

When an rss feed does't have its posts removed very often, the livemark folder gets huge and it would be nice to have firefox automatically filter out the older posts and not display them. Any plans for this? The rss feed (at least for planet) has a pubDate field in the xml, so it should be possible to do this. -rod Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

      <description>This bug is to investigate creating a reporting tool with an XUL wizard (because the wizard is sexy), and use XML-RPC to communicate with the server. Some work on this is already done, I've been thinking about this since day 1. It would be much better from every perspective if we did this. Needed: Examples on connecting/transmission over XML-RPC with Mozilla. Any examples/testcases/help with that appreciated. I'm still getting familiar with XML-RPC in general, and can't find much documentation on the Mozilla side.</description>

      <title>More detailed Add Bookmark form containing all Bookmark Properties fields</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Opera/7.54 (Windows NT 5.1; U) [en] Build Identifier: When creating a bookmark, my only options are to change the name of the bookmark and the folder which it is saved in. However, once a bookmark is created, in its properties I can change the url, assign keywords, create a definition and choose to have it open in a sidebar. All of the options in Properties should be available when initially creating a bookmark. This would make FireFox bookmarks even more efficient since one would not have to go back through their bookmarks just to change these options. Importantly, the option to assign a keyword should definitely be available when adding a bookmark. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Ctrl+D (Bookmark This Page) 2. Right-click on a Bookmark, select Properties 3. Actual Results: Ctrl+D brings up the Add Bookmark window in which I can change the name of my bookmark, and choose which folder to put it in, along with choosing if I want to bookmark all tabs into this folder. Viewing a bookmark's properties displays and allows me to edit/add the bookmark name, location, keyword, description and to choose if it should be loaded into the sidebar. Expected Results: The "Add Bookmark" window should be a replica of a bookmark's "Properties", with the addition of choosing which folder to save the bookmark in, and the "bookmark all tabs in this folder" option. Meaning, there should be a Name, Location, Keyword, Description field and the option to load the bookmark into the sidebar.</description>

When viewing a page which is dispalyed in the wrong encoding, one has to go the top menu, and proceed from there. It would be great to have it as a right-click context menus option like in MS IE (od forbid). Also - and this is guess is more comlex - is it possible to preserve ta chosen encoding for a whole site/session/tab so that I will not have to change encoding for each page? thanks, noam Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

The problem about Alt+Home is that you can't issue it with one hand, and that's not good. Note the following: On Mac OS X, Ctrl+Space seems to bring up the context menu, and thus that should be taken into account if this RFE is being implemented.

      <title>multiple keywords open multiple bookmarks</title>

The advantage is I can have 1 keyword that searches multiple sites at the same time. e.g., "books &lt;keyword&gt;" Can do a search on eBay, Barnes&amp;Nobels and Amazon at the same time and load them in separate tabs. Consequently, bookmarks will then need to support multiple keywords so that I can still search that one site by itself or along with others. e.g., http://www.amazon.com Keyword: amazon, books "amazon Harry Potter" -&gt; Amazon only "books Harry Potter" -&gt; All engines Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce:</description>

      <title>.tabs-closebutton class should be globally defined in toolbarbutton.css (put class back on #find-closebutton)</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041020 Firefox/1.0 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041020 Firefox/1.0 The find toolbar was recently given it's own stylesheet in global, but the close button lost the .tabs-closebutton class, i assume because it was only defined in browser/browser.css. That class is still useful on that button for defining the source image and hover and active states, which are the same for the tab bar, side bar, message bars, and find toolbar. The only things that change are borders, and padding, which are easily handled on a per-case basis by using IDs. If the .tabs-closebutton is moved to global/toolbarbutton.css, then it can be picked up anywhere it needs to be used. So the two things i'm asking for: 1. Move the basic styles to global 2. Return the .tabs-closebutton class to #find-closebutton, and use it on any other close buttons in the future. I'll be honest and admit that part of why i'm requesting this is because it needlessly breaks my theme. But it's also just a logical, more efficient and consistent use of code. Patch on the way...

      <title>Can't get bookmark sidebar smaller when trying to resize it</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041001 Firefox/0.10.1 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041001 Firefox/0.10.1 Thanks for your reading this minor complaint. In IE you can resize the favorites sidebar box by left clicking on the boundry of the favorites sidebar with the web page and dragging it to the left. One thing I noticed in Firefox is that when resizing to the left ( making it less wide ), it stops abruptly. My suggestion would be to collapse it all the way over to the left if desired. Similiar to the Help screen sidebar, but it stops at 6 characters wide. IE used to go to 1 character wide if desired. This would leave more room for the web page to be displayed. I beleive the user should be able to go as far as he/she would want to when making sidebars less wide. Thanks for reading my suggestion. Im a new user and really like Firefox. Thanks for making a alternative to IE. marc obx2001@yahoo.com Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. click on the bookmarks toolbar icon 2. locate the mouse pointer to the column between the main web page and the bookmark sidebar. 3. left click and keep depressed and drag the colum to the left as far as it goes. 4. it stops collapsing way to early and wont go any more to the left. Actual Results: It stops collapsing the bookmark sidebar to early. Expected Results: It should go all the way over perhaps to the folder icon or the plus sign icon if the user desires, thus mimimizing the width of the bookmark sidebar. Using default theme.</description>

E.g. I create a Live bookmark for the RSS feed at slashdot. I could then add a link which will always be at the top of that live bookmark pointing to www.slashdot.org, with a separator in between that and the entries. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: Make a live bookmark Actual Results: Can only define name/location for bookmark. Expected Results: Asked for a 'base link' This could be done by changing the 'OK' button in the create live bookmark prompt into a Next button. The next page would have a prompt to either add a base link or complete the bookmark. The page &amp; name for the 'base link' could be taken from the page that you added the livemark from, if you used the orange button. Adding base links to an already present live bookmark could be handled by right clicking on the live bookmark and having an 'Add base link' option in the menu.</description>

Pages where the whole content is centered in the browser window "jump" to the left when the pages gets longer than the visible height. I know that IE has the space for the scrollbar alway visible to avoid that. I also know that Firefox displays the scrollbar only if needed but this results in the mentioned problem and makes it impossible to make the page stay where it is. Which is, from the designers point of view, an important requirement. Considering a dynamic page where the UI elements stay the same but the length of the content varies it is an annoying experience for the user when the page content "jumps" to the left and back again a couple of pixels when browsing through a site where content is sometimes longer than the visible space and sometimes shorter. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Go to google.com (did not find a better example) 2. Reduce window height until vertical scrollbar appears Actual Results: Page jumps to the left and back when changing window height Expected Results: Page should stay centered in the window not in the rendered space. As an alternative rendering method perhaps?</description>

That is, if there are no menu items above those that are currently visible, the top arrow should turn grey (or just an outline). Then, after the user has scrolled down and there are hidden items at the top of the menu, the arrow should become solid and black. It would be cool if the arrow could disappear when it's inactive, but I don't think its feasible, because the menu items would shift when the top arrow disappeared. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open a bookmarks menu in the bookmark toolbar. 2. Scroll through the menu. 3. Notice that the arrow doesn't reflect whether or not there are hidden items in that direction. Actual Results: No feedback from the arrow.

For example, say I already have Firefox open to a couple web pages. I get an email, in which I click a link. As it stands, this opens a new Firefox window to execute the link. Since one of the foremost reasons I use Firefox is for tabbed browsing, I would much prefer to have my programs open links into new tabs whenever Mozilla is already running. I'm not sure how complicated this would be to implement, but it seems the only real issue is checking whether a Mozilla process is already active, and then choosing new tab or new window accordingly.

This is counterintuitive to users of Mac's who are not Unix Savvy. If they are using Firefox over a network and are logged in to two machines, then Firefox forces them to create a second profile. When it comes to swapping back to a previous profile however, it is not clear where the profile manager is. There is no help in the help documentation, and it was only after a search on the web that I found what to do. So I would like to suggest that access to the Profile manager is also made available on the Tools Menu bar, so that non-unix Mac users will be able to find what to do. And also that a section in the help is added too describing profiles and the profile manager, why they exist, and why you cannot have two copies of the same profile open at the same time. I hope this hasn't already been discussed - I couldn't find anything about it after a long search. Great product! Trying to encourage others to make the switch!

Technorati currently has the freshest (most recent) and most comprehensive index of blogs, thus a Technorati search plugin is a logical choice for this. I will enclose the necessary technorati.src and technorati.gif files. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce:</description>

      <title>Live bookmark should have link to site main page</title>

But for some reasons or another, the user would like to go to the main page of the rss site : by example, the rss cannot be loaded, not having to make two bookmarks for the same site... The main URL of a RSS feed is usually provided into the &lt;link&gt; entry of the &lt;channel&gt; section. It could be a supplementary entry after the separator in the live submenu, or by double-clicking onto the live entry in his parent menu. (sorry for bad english, i'm french) Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

      <title>Ctrl+Tab/Ctrl+Shift+Tab order should be ordered on a stack of most recently viewed, not a circular route around the order opened</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041026 Firefox/1.0RC1 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041026 Firefox/1.0RC1 Like tab ordering in Windows, I expect to be taken to the last tab I had selected before navigating to current tab. So if I have more than 2 tabs open, if I want to Ctrl+Tab between the first two, I should only have to do that once. Similarly, Ctrl+Shift+Tab should work from the bottom of that stack. This should also address the problem of displaying the next tab over to the right when closing the current tab _instead of_ displaying the tab viewed previously to the current one that is being closed. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open atleast 3 tabs 2. Select the "rightmost" tab 3. Select the "leftmost" tab 4. Hit Ctrl+Tab or close the "leftmost" tab Actual Results: The next tab over to the right of the "leftmost" tab (in this case the second tab on the toolbar) is displayed. Expected Results: The "rightmost" tab should have been displayed. It's an easy fix; implement a stack, and every time a tab is given focus, move it to the top of the stack.</description>

Firefox seems to have this feature missing or I am not educated on the correct method of doing so using the browser. The only method I know if is to simply use the back arrow. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. View several sites within the same window. 2. Press the backspace/delete (not *del*). 3. It doesn't function and move back to previous pages. Actual Results: Nothing. Expected Results: Moved back to previously viewed pages (just like hitting the back arrow on the toolbar).</description>

      <title>Great usability problem: "new tab" button should appear in the default toolbar or somewhere else</title>

Every article we wrote, every user we try to convince we tell him: "hey, Firefox has got tabbed browsing". So he install it, and what he will say? - Where is that "tabbed browsing" they talk so often about? If it's a fabolous feature, why we hide it? See just what Opera had done. I think a small "new tab" button it's useful to new and old users. Geek could remove it, but please keep in mind we're approaching average users. We've a "go" button beside the location bar (I think also IE users knows the keyboard Return function), and we don't have an icon for that wonderfull new feature for whom Firefox is famous for. I think we should provide a "new tab" button with the next version of Firefox. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

Now it can be confused with Windows's exit application button by some new users, especially because it's colour is dominant (red). Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

      <title>New installer options - default browser and profile migration</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041026 Firefox/1.0RC1 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041026 Firefox/1.0RC1 I'd like to suggest adding two options to the Firefox installer - whether or not to set the default browser, and whether or not to run the profile migration wizard. Firefox currently prompts the user (in Windows) to set it as the default browser upon initial launch, but it would be nice to have that option during the actual install. This would be especially useful for silent installs, deployments, etc. The other request is similar - include an option in the installer to enable or disable the profile migration wizard upon initial launch. This would also be useful for silent installs and deployments, where it otherwise might confuse or annoy the user (I fall into the latter category :-). Thanks.

Opera on the other hand offers a very neat setting called "smart resize" which will use a more complicated and slower scaling algorithm. While i think we should keep the normal scale function for slow computers, and use it as the default. I think we also need a pretty and nice anti-aliasing function which can be enabled by a setting just like the "smooth scrolling" setting. (perhaps even allow the user to choose the maximum size (KB) of the image he'd like to scale with the expensive function. (as larger jpg's will allready be slow. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.load a scaled image in firefox 2.load the same image in opera with smooth scaling 3.notice the difference, if it's not that bas try scaling the image up or down 1 pixel and try again. Actual Results: I liked the opera way of scaling better. Expected Results: given me a simple setting, link the smooth scroll setting. and if i enabled smooth scaling, and the image was smaller than the amount of KB i selected it would have been caled using the pretty anti aliasing function. for dutch people: (english folks can look at the screenshots) http://gathering.tweakers.net/forum/list_messages/971306</description>

Today one bad web page took out 30+ open windows... While I hope that specific bug can be tackled, there will be others that hit me or other people. Why not reduce the pain with this general idea? 1) Once a minute write a list of open web page in windows and tabs into ~/.mozilla/firefox/PROFILE_DIR/CrashRecovery/DATETIME.html. A timestamp at the top, and simple indented list (title of winow, and URL shown since titles aren't always meaningful). Skip if no new windows opened. 2) If firefox is exiting cleanly, delete the file on the way out. 3) If a file exists in the CrashRecovery directory when Firefox is starting, offer the list of files in the directory, and a chance to do the following for any file: -- Open the list of pages as a single HMTL file, so each required page can be opened via a click. Default option. -- Open the list of pages again, in a window set as before. Resource heavy, and may trigger same problem, so make this the second option. -- Delete the particular CrashRecovery file I will be offering a reward for an implementation of this or a comparable crash recovery scheme, in addition to making a long overdue donation to the Mozilla project...

Having an option to block images from a server is not logical (at least to me) when images are already not allowed to load. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Disable image loading by unchecking 'Load Images' option 2. Open a web page (i.e. http://mozilla.org ) that has at least one image 3. Right click on an image Actual Results: Context menu shows an option to block images from the server Expected Results: Context menu should have a line as 'Allow Images from mozilla.org' in this example.</description>

Firefox browser cannot know whether these are RSS feeds or not. So it would be very useful to have a menu item in the 'bookmark folder context menu' saying 'New live bookmark' next to 'New bookmark'. Alternatively the 'New bookmark' dialog can contain a checkbox to mark the bookmark as a live feedback. The bug report #255637 states that we should be able to add live bookmarks from the context menu of a link. Yes, that would be nice too, but that still needs the links to have one of the valid extensions such as .rss, .xml, etc. Capabilitiy of manual addition of bookmarks will be a more powerful feature. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: This is a new feature request, it doesn't have steps. Actual Results: So it is not possible to reproduce it. Expected Results: The software should support manual addition of live bookmarks.</description>

      <title>URL bar should lose secure indication while new URL is typed</title>
      <description>If I'm in a secure site, and I type a new address in the URL bar without pressing enter, and then go about my business for a while, I might forget that the URL displayed is not that of a secure site. Would it not be better to make the URL bar white again while a new URL is being typed?</description>

      <title>missing a "go" button to allow loading new URL without touching the keyboard</title>

Users use the mouse to copy from another application and can currently paste the url into the address bar, but without a "go" button you have to hit "enter" on the keyboard to actually load the URL. Ideally the "go" button should be in the standard toolbar, but at the least it should be in the optional "customize the toolbar" section. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Start a new browser window. 2. 3.</description>

Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. have a failed RSS feed 2. look at the resulting menu item 3. click on it Actual Results: Nothing Expected Results: Taken to the source of the broken RSS feed Alternately, there could be an option at the bottom of the menu, right above "Open in Tabs", which would say "Visit Feed Home", and this option could always be there.</description>

I was playing a Java game, which opens in a popup. Halfway through the game I received an email and I clicked on a link in that email. This link opened in the popup window (since it was the most active window) as a new tab, effectively hiding the other tab with the game. This bug is about changing FF behaviour when users have external links set to open in tabs and popup windows set to not open in tabs. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open any webpage with a popup 2. Click on the popup windows to give it focus 3. Now click on a link in an external application Actual Results: The external link opens in tab in the popup window, effectively hiding content of the popup. (Only way to display previous tab is to use CTRL-TAB) Expected Results: My suggestion is that the external link should be opened in tab in the most recent normal Firefox window, not in a popup window.</description>

It's perfect for google. But some other sites expect the request encoded with different encoding (e.g. ISO-8859-15). And they don't understand non ascii characters in UTF-8. Thus I would like to have an option to select charset per bookmark. I don't know if the keywords are always UTF-8 encoded or it's just because I have it as a default encoding. Anyway I need several different ones, so global setting is not good enough. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Go to http://dict.leo.org 2. Add a keyword search for word search. 3. Run the keyword search with key 'wählen'. Perhaps default browser encoding has to be set to UTF-8. Actual Results: Search input contains 'wÃ hlen' instead of 'wählen'.</description>

Or the domain appears way down the list. One example of how this can happen is if you get linked to articals on a site more oftern than you visit the homepage. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Start typing the domain of a frequenty visited site to which you don't visit the homepage/root that oftern. Actual Results: Many URLs for the domain appear, but they all have paths after the domain. E.G: http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/ http://www.mozilla.org/developer/ ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/thunderbird/release/0.9/ http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/ Expected Results: The site root should always appear first in the list, even if it has never been visited.

One can zoom the text size in FF, but that is a per-page setting, not a global, persistent setting (see bug 260143). Also, not all web sites need the same zoom factor. I therefor want to suggest adding an option to specify a minimum font size. This should be a global, persistent setting, and whenever a website uses font sizes that are smaller than the configured minimum size, they are automatically increased. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: Look at www.byte.com using a high-res 1680x1050 laptop screen (like my Dell laptop has). I cannot lower the resolution, and the font used on the Byte site is very small.</description>

I use Thunderbird to read RSS feeds. If I got to a page in Firefox I would like to get the RSS feed from, I currently have to add the webpage into Firefox's live bookmark and then edit it to extract the feed URL. My suggested enhancement is this: I would like to left-click on the RSS button to bring up the RSS list and then right-click on the feed I am interested in. On right-clicking I would like the selected feed URL to be automatically added to Thunderbird's list of RSS subscriptions. At the moment, it is really difficult to do this manually and it is preventing me from getting the most from both Thunderbird and Firefox. I prefer to use these two tools, rather than Mozilla which may solve my problem due to its integration. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Not applicable 2. 3.

It says that it will automatically do so when you click OK, but there is no cancel button, so you are forced to close Firefox and lose any data (I had 3 Bugzilla tabs open, for example). Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open Firefox with at least one tab 2. Go to the Add/Remove Programs Control Panel 3. Attempt to uninstall Firefox Actual Results: A window appears telling you that it needs to quit Firefox, and that it will do so automatically when you click OK. Expected Results: In addition to the OK button, there should be a Cancel button in case you don't want it to quit Firefox for you. After it quits Firefox you can still cancel the uninstallation, but you should be able to cancel it before it forces Firefox to quit.</description>

      <title>Improving firefox's tabbed browsing architecture (not just UI improvements)</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win 9x 4.90; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041103 Firefox/1.0RC2 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win 9x 4.90; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041103 Firefox/1.0RC2 This bug gives some suggestions to how firefox could improve its underlying architecture in tabbed browsing for Firefox 1.1. First of all, I think firefox should implement two modes on the UI level, tabbed browsing mode and traditional browsing mode (aka. new window mode). User just select their preferred mode and the appropriate settings will be selected. This simplies the tabbed browsing preferences in "Options.../Advanced" and make it easier for novice users. On the underlying level, we should implement the following preferences Browser.open.opennewfor.bookmarks (this option allies to the bookmarks sidebar, the bookmarks toolbar and the bookmarks menu) Browser.open.opennewfor.history (this option applies to the history sidebar and the go menu) Browser.open.opennewfor.DDEcall (this option should also apply to the firefox help system and the extensions manager) Browser.open.opennewfor.externallink Browser.open.opennewfor.home Browser.open.opennewfor.javascriptcall (if false is selected, popups will be opened in the current tab) Browser.open.opennewfor.middleclick (shift+click and ctrl+click should dod the same thing under this: either they open a new winodw or a new tab) Browser.open.opennewtab Browser.open.openinforeground (this option also applies to new window mode. It specifies whether or not the newly opened window will receive focus) I am sure this bug duplicates the ideas of other bugs and some of the ideas had already been implemented. It would be nice if these bugs are cosolidated into one meta bug to be resolved. I believe the proposed changes will make fx's architecture less confusing and will solve the tab browsing problems once and for all. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce:</description>

      <title>Firefox should link to the apropriate help-section when possible.</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041007 Firefox/0.10.1 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041007 Firefox/0.10.1 As it is today Mozilla Firefox is launched with a very good help-section. A section that I think don't quite get the attention that I should. I think that it would be a really good idea (espesially for new users) if different parts of Firefox linked to the apropriate help-section. The sections I'm reffering to is e.g. most of the different sections of options, extensions, themes... The linking could easiest be made by a simple little link with some sort of "help"-text to it. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: Possible usercase: 1. Open options. 2. Open privacy 3. Click on cookies Actual Results: No help-link to the cookies section of Mozilla Firefox Help (even though it exist a very good text about how to handle cookies) Expected Results: A little help-link to the cookies section of Mozilla Firefox Help.</description>

      <title>Implement better support for Dublin Core Metadata in Live Bookmarks</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0 (MOOX M3) Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0 Firstly, this is regarding Live Bookmarks (RSS, Atom, RDF-based). An RDF file for RSS using mostly Dublin Core Metadata (and some RSS from its namespace) will not parse correctly for use in a live bookmark. DC allows for more descriptive RSS, and it should be added for use for use in RSS bookmarks. Links pertaining to this: http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/ http://dublincore.org/ Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Attempt to use a DC-based RDF file for use in an RSS bookmark. Actual Results: "Live Bookmark feed failed to load." Expected Results: Treat it like a pure RSS or Atom file.</description>

It did not exists in the previous version of Firefox that I used (I think it was 0.09 with Mizilla 1.6.8.) Since Firefox does not contain a composer, when you set Firefax as the default browser it does not list Edit (to edit HTMP pages) as a menu item in Windows Explorer's. So I created one and set Mozilla in composer mode as the application for this menu item. I also created "Edit with Netscape" as another menu item with the corresponding Netscape's composer as the application. Some time later I changed the default browser to Mozilla. The two editing menu items were present and usable following this change. When I reset Firefox as the default browser both menu items for editing HTML pages were removed. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Set the default browser to Mozilla or Netscape. 2. Create Edit action for the HTM, HTML file extensions In Windows' Explorer. 2.1. Verify that when Right- clicking on HTML file the new action you created such as "Edit" or "Edit with Mozilla" or "EDit with netscape" are present and functional. 3. Set the default browser to Firefox. 3.1. Verify that the editing actions on right click are gone. Actual Results: The editing actions on right click are gone from Windows Explorer's right-click menu. Expected Results: The menu items should remain visible, active and functional.</description>

This is quite a useful feature Safari currently has for portable Mac users like myself who rely on the "Locations" feature in OS X, which allows us to define multiple network setting profiles including proxy details. Currently, Firefox 1.0 can only autodetect proxy settings on a network (I suspect by looking for a proxy autoconfiguration script), but not read the system settings. I have considered writing a script to parse /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/preferences.plist on an OS X system where the proxy settings are saved and returning the values in the format of a proxy autoconfiguration script as a crude, but effective workaround. Is anyone else interested in helping make this long needed feature be developed? Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Change OS X "Location" to change network settings and proxies accordingly. 2. Attempt to use Firefox without manually editing/changing the proxy settings within Firefox. Actual Results: Firefox has not received the new proxy settings available in the system settings to Safari and Firefox must be reconfigured manually accordingly. Expected Results: Firefox should be able to update the proxy settings, depending on the active "Location" from the system settings without being restarted.</description>

      <title>OSX Disk image should be marked Internet-Enabled</title>
      <description>Firefox is currently distributed in a disk image (.dmg), and the user is expected to copy the application icon to their Applications folder to install it. This is fine, but as of Mac OS X 10.2.3, there's a better way: mark the disk image as "Internet-Enabled", and the Firefox application will be automatically copied to the Desktop and the disk image unmounted and moved to the Trash (and the Internet- Enabled flag is cleared, so if the user drags the disk image back out of the Trash, it will behave normally). This is explained at the URL above. To set the Internet-Enabled flag, run this: hdiutil internet-enable -yes /path/to/Firefox-1.x.dmg just before gzipping. See bug 257854, which is still legitimate for users of older versions of Mac OS X.</description>

      <title>opening all painted links in tabs or windows and a new page viewing idea</title>

Many pages contain a list of links that must be clicked individually to see the contents of the pages but if user could open multiple links with a couple of mouse moves it would become easy to see such pages. Instead of tabs it could be handy to have links opened in a new kind of a viewing system. The system could be something like a normal image viewing program (without thumbs, only slides) but it would display web content. There would be a list (not necessary visible) of sites that are to be viewed with this page viewer. User then clicks next and previous buttons to view through all the pages. Maybe user should be able to drop out non interesting links. An example about the first and the latter combined. User enters a FTP-directory containing multiple images. Instead of clicking them all, user paints all the files, chooses "viewer" from the right button menu and then is able to view the images easily in one browser window. This would work for web pages containing image url catchers etc. After dropping out poor images user could then press choose "save files" making a nightmare to be easy downloading.

      <title>in-page anchors near the bottom of the page take longer to find</title>

You know when you click on a link that takes you to an in-page anchor, like samepage.html#item12 ? Usually the item is in the middle of a long page and your browser aligns the viewport so that the item is right up at the top. However, when the item is near the bottom of the page, it is harder to find, because it is not in the expected top-of-page position. Furthermore, (this is a secondary issue) butting the item up to the top of the viewport is not ideal. The eye tends to skip it over and look for something with more whitespace around it, or something more centrally located. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. go to http://www.mozilla.org/src-faq.html#12 Actual Results: notice that item 12 is not aligned at the top of the viewport Expected Results: suggestions: 1- somehow highlight the target, either with a bigger font, colored background, or animation. 2- somehow obscure the content above the target, thus drawing the eye to the target. I think a 50% transparent white area above the target that dissapeared when the user clicked or scrolled on the page would be ideal 3- somehow make it that the target appears at the top of the viewport a- by allowing the viewport to show whitespace beyond the bottom of the page (a la paper-centric apps like PDF viewers) b- by increasing the height of the statusbar to make up the difference.</description>

      <title>Add Wikipedia to the set of default search engines (using relevant language)</title>

Currently Firefox has several generic web searchers, and a dictionary, but no encyclopedia by default. Normal users are very familiar with using encyclopedias, and encyclopedias are very broadly useful, so it's a capability that most users would find useful. Also, Wikipedia's development approach is very consonant with the Firefox development approach - the two projects have much in common, and highlighting Wikipedia will probably help highlight Firefox as well. It also creates a special ability in Firefox that its competitors don't have - it then comes with a built-in capability to search an encyclopedia. Yes, obviously people can add Wikipedia as a search option. But by including it by default, EVERYONE can do it, without having to install anything. Since it's a very popular addition, it'd be great to build it in. Note this is a generalization of bug 268166. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: After default install, click on search engines. Actual Results: No wikipedia entry. Expected Results: Show a Wikipedia entry :-).</description>

      <title>No easy way to put Bookmarks in order I had them in Inernet Explorer. ( import sort order )</title>

I can't find anything!!! It is absolutely essential that when IE favorites are imported into Foxfire bookmarks menu that the exact order at each menu level be maintained. Also essential that there is a way to return to that "customized" order after using the varius sort options (eg sort in alphabetical order. Finally, it is important the user be able to easily create a custom order (via drag &amp; drop within the bookmarkes menu). For that last point Suggest copying IE capability/method since everyone knows how to do it that way already. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Import bookmark from IE 2. Try to find the bookmark I am looking for (at the top menu level). 3. Can't find the bookmark because it's in the wrong order- hidden amongst all my other bookmarks on the same menu level (all of which are in the wrong order). Actual Results: Tell my friends to keep using Internet explorer (with yahoo toolbar that includes free popup blocker and anti-spyware. Foxfire is not yet ready for prime time. Expected Results: Bookmarks should appear in the exact same order I had them in IE. Otherwise the browser is of no use to me! I would call this a critical defect, not just an enhancement. Hope someone can fix this so I can get off of microsoft. :)</description>

      <title>If installing into existing Firefox directory, backup files and install into clean directory</title>
      <description>When installing 1.0, it didn't properly update the existing files for Daa's private build of 1.0PR, and I couldn't work with bookmarks obviously because of binary version issues. It should be unecessary to uninstall Firefox when installing it. You should be able to simply "upgrade". The solution is: If you are installing into a directory that already contains Firefox, instead of overwriting files in a haphhazard manner, they should be backed up. The steps are this: 1) Detect it's already a folder containing Mozilla Firefox 2) Move existing files to [installation folder]\backup 3) Install the new files into [installation folder] You can do this repeatedly, and will just get a long line of backup folders, like: [installation folder]\backup\backup\backup\backup As an alternative, you could do something like backup-2004-12-01_00 and wouldn't get too deep a directory structure</description>

      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041001 Firefox/0.10.1 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041001 Firefox/0.10.1 As people install more and more extensions, the settings become more complicated, and harder to reproduce again on another computer, e.g. being ones notebook or a friends/new users computer. So I would like to suggest a entry in preferences called Back up. When pressed the user should see something like this: ----------------------------------------------- Select the items to back up * Bookmarks * Extensions * Extension settings * FireFox settings * Themes ____________________________ Back up file: |____________________________| ----------------------------------------------- The idea should be, that it should output a tar.gz file containing everything that the user selected. Selecting "extensions", "themes" should include the extensions and themes. If the extensions can't be copied from the current computer, it should download the xpi file, and include that in the final tar.gz file. Losing the Adblock blacklist or Cookie white list, would not be fun at all, so I see great need for such a feature. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

Setting 'browser.tabs.loadOnNewTab' to 1 or 2 always open a blank page when opening new tab. Tested with Win 2000 pro and Win XP home. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. type about.config in URL bar, and set 'browser.tabs.loadOnNewTab' to 1 (open home page on new tab) 2. quit Firefox and restart, type about.config in URL bar to verify that browser.tabs.loadOnNewTab is set to 1 (or 2) 3. go to any other URL 4. Do 'File &gt; New Tab' or Ctrl+T Actual Results: The new tab is blank. Expected Results: The new tab should display the home page (or the last visited page). Like it is specified in 'http://preferential.mozdev.org/preferences.html': &lt;&lt; browser.tabs.loadOnNewTab What should be displayed in a newly created tab * -1 : Browser startup page * 0 : Blank page * 1 : Your homepage * 2 : Last visited page &gt;&gt; Set as mjor because the tab browsing differienciates Mozilla and Firefox to IE</description>

      <title>High CPU usage by extensions, no way to track down the extension responsible.</title>

I've removed extensions when this happens, or when I've had a hunch an extension was badly behaved, and Firefox is a lot more stable, but it still happens occasionally. What I want is a mechanism to track how much time Firefox is spending in different extensions, so I can find out which, if any, if my remaining extensions need to be ripped out. Just having a file that it dumps when it enters and exits an extension and how much CPU time it took that I could grovel through afterwards would be great. Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce Steps to Reproduce: If I could reproduce it I'd know what the problem was. :) I'd describe this as a "critical enhancement". :) Mac OS X 10.2.8 on G4/466</description>

I noticed that &lt;body background="background.jpg" bgproperties=fixed&gt; wasn't behaving properly. 'Bgproperties=fixed' is supposed to make the background stay in one place while the rest of the page scrolls. It worked fine in IE. I'm using Firefox 1.0 (downloaded 11.14.04) Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.Make an html document with a background picture. 2.Include 'bgproperties=fixed' in the &lt;body&gt; tag. 3.Open the test page with Firefox 1.0 and with Internet explorer. Compare the difference. (in Firefox, the background moves like normal) Actual Results: Firefox apparently didn't recognize the command 'bgproperties'. Does this make Firefox not HTML 4.0 compliant?

It does however manage to import all of my "Internet Shortcut"s. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Load a local HTML file in IE. 2. Drag the document icon from the location box onto IE's Links bar (this creates a Shortcut, rather than an Internet Shortcut). 3. Install Firefox and import IE favorites. Actual Results: Firefox imports all internet shortcuts, but no (regular windows) shortcuts. Expected Results: Firefox's links bar should contain all shortcuts (internet or otherwise), or internet shortcuts to the same shortcuts. Changing a local file link to a URL would just involve prepending it with file:/// and reversing any backslashes. Changing a UNC path (eg \\machine\share\file.html) file link to a URL would involve prepending it simply with file: and reversing backslashes. A workaround for the import problem would be to copy the shortcuts into Firefox by hand, but this can be time consuming and frustrating (since it's awkward to compare the contents of the Favorites folder with those in the bookmarks manager, and painful to add new shortcuts for each link missing). Also, technically speaking, file: URLs should not need rewriting at all (they're meant to get passed unchanged to the underlying filesystem), but Firefox doesn't seem to do this the way I'd expect either. Opening UNC files directly into Firefox results in URLs like "file://///machine/share/file.html", which is silly.</description>

With the release of FireFox 1.0 PR, I started to see other search engines listed in firefox search bar. At first I wasn't that much shocked about it. But I was wondering why there're just the five of them. And after I saw a discussion of de-DE version of Firefox, I understood that i'm totally right on my worries. That search bar is totally generates a bias on search ing mechanism. That must be the last thing that mozilla foundation or any FREE (as in speech not beer), software advocate would like. Since ancestor of mozilla (netscape) is suffered from that bias microsoft created over browsers, mozilla should be more than careful about that. Considering the search engines in the list are all commercial companies (and that includes Google) having them in Free product does not look like right. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: fire up firefox Actual Results: You see list of search engines, that's actualy popular ones, but still it must be YOU that choose which of them to have in search bar list. One thing more as you can't wipe off IE from windows, you can't wipe off the search engine in that list without deleting the related files from shell. There's no gui, aka easy way, to get rid of them. Expected Results: Instead of default search engines, user should use add engine link, (and make it work well of course) and choose the search engines in his/her favor. That of course will annoy some people, but it's better to be that way to have not biased firefox. We want it free as in speech, not free as in beer (like spyware etc.) http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=164892&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;postsperpage=15&amp;start=0 That's the discussion over de-DE version of firefox, and that unfortunate situation that firefox acts like an exact spyware. There can be claims like google, or any other search engine is defacto standard. But however then anyone can also claim IE is defacto standard too? I'm totally against any commercial search engine (commercial like getting profit from searchs, so not like having search is free).</description>

      <title>Use separate directories for saving images and saving web pages</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1) Build Identifier: Firefox 1 Final If I save one webpage then I wana save an image form that webpage or another on one folder the Save Image As dialog box invites me to save that picture in the same directory that I used to save the webpage, if I save in another directory then wana to save another webpage when I wana save that webpage the Save As webpage dialog box invites me to save that page in the directory i have saved the image. Please make to maintain the path of directory where I save webpages diferent from the path that I used to save images, so every time I wana save a webpage to save in the same directory that i saved the last one and when I wana save a picture to save it in the same directory that I saved the last picture direfent from the directory that I have saved the webpage. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open one webpage 2. Click Save Page As and save it to a directory 3. On a picture on that webpage click Save Image As and save it on another directory diferent from that you save the webpage first 4. Open another webpage and Save that webpage, now the Save Page As dialog box invites you to save the webpage in the directoty where you saved the last picture when it should invite you to save this webpage in the directory where you saved the last webpage. Actual Results: It does not maintain the diferent paths where you saved the pictures and webpages instead it uses the same path for both making it dificult to save images in another directory diferent from that you saved the last webpage. Expected Results: Every Save Page As should maintain its path to the last saved webpage directory. Every Save Image As dialog box should invite to save the image to the last directory where you have saved the last image diferent from the directory you have saved the webpage. In this bugy format it is very hard to save images in a directory diferent from that you save the webpages especialy if you save images and webpages in the same time.</description>

I do not talk about saving a certain page, this can be done. I talk about saving the page and all the pages linked to it (and maybe the pages linked to them and so on) and keeping the links. There are programs that do it, but usually one should write the URL (and maybe tell how deep one wants the download to be). This does not work with websites that need a password in order to get into. I think an equivalent to 'Save Page As...', but with the option to save the links from this page as well might be useful. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

There's no way for me to just query the string, since XUL doesn't appear anywhere in the Mozilla ACCEPT header. I can look for the string "Gecko", but that also appears in Safari (for some reason they have "Like gecko"). So I have to explicitly filter out safari. This is a clumsy hack. If I'm looking for XUL support, the ideal method would be to simply ask if the browser has XUL support. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

They tried clicking and dragging the RSS feed icon from the bottom right of Firefox to Thunderbird, and it didn't work. They're not very technical people, so it became somewhat of a chore for them to find the feed URL and add it with a wizard to Thunderbird. Now, I realize this would require work on both products, but I'm opening it here first. Is it possible to get support so we can click and drag around the RSS icon in the bottom right? If that gets done, then the next step would be to add a listener to Thunderbird to receive the RSS feed. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce:</description>

      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040803 Firefox/0.9.3 Build Identifier: When you activate the bookmarks side bar (CTRL+B), all folders are open by default. To close all open folders, you have to click each folder to collapse it. I wish that there is a button or a context menu entry to collapse all open folders at once. Since there is already a "Collapse" context menu entry, perhaps adding a "collapse all" entry below that wouldn't be much of a problem. Other browsers have that too, but Firefox is my browser of choice and it would be great if that feature would exist there as well. Thanks in advance &amp; keep up the good work! Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: Expected Results: All folders should be closed after the described action above.</description>

I click on a link to http://www.foo.com/bar/baa/bla/foobar.htm 2. I navigate to http://sf.net/ 3. I want to look at the "home page" for the site I visited in 1, i.e. http://www.foo.com. Typing "fo" should give me "foo.com", with "o.com" selected. If I press END, the next directory will be expanded i.e. foo.com/bar, with "/bar" selected. For an example of this behaviour, MSIE inline autocomplete. With the existing behaviour, I must type in the whole domain or select the history entry, then up. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Navigate to a deeply nested page of a site with a long domain name. 2. Navigate to a second site. 3. Navigate to the home page of URL 1, or a directory half way down the previously visited tree. Actual Results: RSI Expected Results: Autocomplete will expand the URL from the history list as I type, first the domain then one directory at a time. Shell command line autocompletion could also be used as a model.</description>

Feature request is to have it switch back to the last active tab. Most common scenario is browing in Tab #1 (with lots of tabs after). Open a link in a new tab, finish reading it, and then you are dropped to the furthest right tab which is the one you likely wish to be in. Less common scenario. I have one website (www.fastbuzz.com) that uses popup windows to drive some functionality. If I turn on Mozilla experimental feature of opening all popups in a new tab any time I click somewhere it pops open a new tab which immediately closes but leaves me on the right most tab (instead of the one I wish to be on). Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open Three tabs 2. In the tab #1 open a web-page and then open a link in a new tab (it will tab #4) 3. Close Tab #4 and you now on tab #3 Actual Results: You are on Tab #3 which is not the content you were previously on. Expected Results: To be back on Tab #1 which trigger the link.</description>

      <title>sorting bookmarks removes separators</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0 I categorized my bookmarks using separators. Later I added a few bookmarks. Later I sorted the bookmarks alphabetically. The sort erased the categories I'd made using the separators. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Arrange bookmarks using separators 2. Sort alphabetically 3. Actual Results: The bookmarks were sorted alphabetically. The separators were gone. I could not return to the previous state Expected Results: Allowed me to return to the previous state (Undo). Maintained the separators and their contents. Can't the separators be treated as folders who's contents are displayed without user intervention? That way, they and their contents can be sorted like any other hierarchical display and the separators will remain as borders for concept categories. If I haven't communicated this well, forgive me.</description>

      <title>Load images from the originating... domain!</title>

It's very efficient in keeping out advertisments and the like. Unfortunately, it's as efficient in keeping out image from the originating web site, too. Look at Amazon or Ebay, the displayed pages are not exactly what you want. I wonder whether "..-&gt;Load Images-&lt;for the originating web site's domain" would be more useful? Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: Actual Results: I expected to see the original site's content w/o ads. Expected Results: I saw incomplete pages because big sites tend to host their images on special servers.</description>

With the default theme, the only difference between a secure site and a nonsecure site, is the slash through the padlock icon. Would it be possible for the location bar to turn red with white lettering to let the user know that they're on an unsecure site? With themes like Noia 2.0 eXtreme, the lettering turns red on a white background, which is more noticable. Just a thought. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Go to the site listed 2. Notice the "unsecure site" icon 3. Consider this bug</description>

This document should focus on two subjects: 1. UI differences (keyboard shortcuts, modified menus, missing/hidden prefs, etc...) 2.

      <title>No way to remove a search plugin from the GUI</title>
      <description>Allthough it is very easy to *add* new search-plugins over the search-popup, it is not possible to *remove* plugins. Instead, you have to manually delete the associated files in the searchplugins-directory yourself. It would be handy to be able to remove search-plugins just like bookmarks, over a rightclick-menu invoked on the plugin-item. The cheapest method would be an additional menu-entry "Remove plugin" that opens the searchplugins-directory, but that won't help the normal user.</description>

      <title>Control Panel entry for Firefox (might be obsel. due to 1.5 mass install extensions/themes)</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0 (ax) Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0 (ax) I had this idea, but I found the comment listed above. As noted in the comment: Go here: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=264889#c17 [snip] As for a Control Panel item you're meant to create a .cpl file, but it's also possible to create a CLSID for a Firefox Control Panel (which launches C:\\PROGRA~1\\MOZILL~1\\FIREFOX.EXE -chrome \"chrome://browser/content/pref/pref.xul\") and then add it to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\ControlPanel\NameSpace. [/snip] I did not want to talk about that specific part of the NameSpace feature, because it would detract focus, so I made it a new enhancement. My thoughts on it are: ---------------------- Entry in Control Panel: Firefox Options ---------------------- What it does: ---------------------- Basically a modded version of your usual Firefox options panel, with options for adding themes or extensions. You would be able to add many themes and extensions rather quickly as the browser isn't in memory persay. If it is, could we make this some sort of seperate application or something small that wouldn't need the entire browser to be in memoery? (I know how you guys are on overall filesizes). This would further expedite the Firefox "experience" and say to Microsoft: "See? We can put stuff in your Control Panel too!" ---Either:--- *The normal Internet Options icon would be hidden (replaced with "Firefox Options". A registry key could hide the original) -OR- It could totally replace the Internet Options dialog (including adding the Firefox icon. Basically the above idea, but renaming it to "Internet Options") -OR- The "Firefox Options" could just be added and not hide the normal Internet Options (I can't think of a time when, if you don't use IE, that you actually need this tool). This enhancemnt could be added in a future "Admin Install" of Firefox as I hear custom installers are in the works to roll out on networks. Home users could have the option too. ;-) Thanks for your time. Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce Steps to Reproduce:</description>

Sites that do not provide small icon (icon that appears in top left of the window bar), hava randomly asigned icons. (BBC has wrong icon - see that "i" icon appears many times, also "linux today" icon appears twice, once where it should, next time to the wrong site.) These icons do not change the place. Details about configuration: My bookmarks were imported from Mozilla 1.7.3 (Win). No icons appeared then in bookmarks. After some browsing, FF added respective icons. In one moment I realized they are misplaced/copied to wrong places. Software installation summary: WinXPPro with SP2; Mozilla 1.7.3; FF 1.0; Export of bookmarks from Mozilla; Import in FF Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: Bug happens allways, but I have no resources to reproduce situation where this behavior would happen on "clear" instalation. (See "Details" for step I did in the current instalation.) Actual Results: Icons are misplaced. Expected Results: Icon to be where they should be.</description>

I think gecko should be able to draw at least the dashed border style when using the -moz-border-radius option. If we are going to support css3, (even trough extra css tags, lets at least support the whole branch.) I realize drawing any other border style but solid while using the radius opton is harder than just drawing the square border but it can't be difficult enough not to be implemented. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.create a div, and give it a dashed border, and a noticable background-color trough it style tag. 2.not add -moz-border-radius to it, and notice that the border-style is rendered as if it was set to solid. Actual Results: i got a div with its border rounded, but not a dashed border like i requested. Expected Results: given me a rounded div, with a dashed border instead of solid border.</description>

Not sure if this operation should be separate from Import. A "don't Import duplicates" option in the Import dialog would seem to have the same net effect. Apologies if this is considered a duplicate of bug #10198, but this request involves the action of Importing Bookmarks, not Bookmarking a page, so they seemed distinct enough. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Click Bookmarks, Manage Bookmarks, File, Import... 2. Select "From File" and click Next 3. Browse to a Bookmarks file and click Open Actual Results: All the Bookmarks in the file being Imported are appended to the current set of Bookmarks. Expected Results: There should be an option to merge, rather than append, the entries in the Bookmarks file.</description>

When you query a word in the dictionary, it gives you the meaning and next to the original word there is a small audio icon in red. If you hit that icon then a new window pops up and you can hear the word pronounced (if you are using IE). Firefox pops up a new window, but then the window does nothing. At the bottom of the window there is a message "Having trouble hearing a pronunciation? * Click here to listen with your default audio player. * See the Audio Pronunciation FAQ." and if you click on "Click here to listen with your default..." Then it opens up Real Media Player (which happens to be my default) and plays the pronunciation. IE recognises the fact that Real Player is my default media player. It plays the file as soon as the window opens and you dont have to click on any part of "Having trouble hearing........." Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Goto www.m-w.com 2. Type in a word into the dictionary box (say "bug") 3. Click the red Audio icon next to "bug" Actual Results: A new window opens up. There is no sound. If you click on * Click here to listen with your default audio player. Then it opens up your default audio player and plays the sound in that. Expected Results: A new window opens up. You hear the pronunciation. And it should not open up an audio player.</description>

      <title>[Mac] both delete and del keys should delete bookmarks and history items</title>
      <description>In the Mac OS X version, in the bookmarks manager, the key to delete bookmarks should be intuitively either delete or cmd-delete. It's currently set to cmd-d. While it doesn't violate the Apple HIG, cmd-d is usually used for other things in OS X. Delete is commonly used to delete items from lists (such as the bookmarks manager in Safari, or mails in Mail), so it fits this use. Furthermore, cmd-d is used to *add* a bookmark in the main browser window, so it doesn't make sense for it to do the opposite in the bookmarks manager. This is a duplicate of Mozilla Seamonkey bug 26543. I figured that Firefox would probably require its own patch. If that's wrong, sorry for the bugspam, please dupe it.</description>

      <title>Use a more efficient compression algorithm for official Firefox/Thunderbird/SeaMonkey builds for OS X (bz2 instead of gzip)</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; de-DE; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041108 Firefox/1.0 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; de-DE; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041108 Firefox/1.0 I suggest using a more efficient compression algorithm, such as bzip2, to compress the official Mac OS X builds. This would result in a significantly reduced download size, around 1MB less for Firefox/Thunderbird, even more for the suite. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. got to the mozilla.org download page using a modem or ISDN 2. start downloading 3. wait for ever Actual Results: Download takes too long Expected Results: Download could be faster with BZIP2 instead of GZIP I did some research on the support of BZIP2 in MacOS X and found out that the shipped-with-OSX unpacking application, StuffIt Expander (www.stuffit.com), supports BZIP2 at least since version 6.5, version 9.0 is shipping now. As this is the one standard tool in MacOS for generations already, there should not be any problem using BZIP2. I have been using it for the German packages of Fire[bird|fox] and SeaMonkey for over one year, and there were no complaints about it from the users in that time.</description>

      <title>Using "Load Images", "For the originating website only", and "Exceptions" to block ads</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0 Firefox is an absolutely excellent browser. Just have to say that up front. On thing that I think would make it even better is if I could choose "Load Images", "For the originating website only", and then choose exceptions for those two rules. For example, many news sites have most of their presentation images hosted on their site, but then have their image or Macromedia ads hosted off site. There are just a few websites that I have visited where pertinent content for the page is hosted off site, and those sites would be the "Exceptions". Also, more sophisticated sites are starting to use javascript to document.write('&lt;IFRAME SRC="http://ad.doubleclick.net..."') or document.write('&lt;scr'+'ipt language=javascript src="http://a.tribalfusion.com..."') ads into their site, but the content is still off site. I have used Guidescope to block images in the past, but it cannot handle the Macromedia files, and blocking them through the browser would be the best option. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Install Firefox. 2. Go to www.cnn.com. 3. Notice that it hosts its images at i.cnn.net. Actual Results: Front and center image was blocked. Expected Results: Been able to track this page as an exception to the rule that "All pages should load images only from their own site." I used the Advanced Query to check Bugzilla, and it didn't seem like there was a similar feature request/bug report.</description>

      <title>yahoomail used to be default email, does not work in mozilla</title>

When a mailto: link was clicked on, an IE window would pop up with the mail.yahoo.com webpage open. When one clicked "send as attachment" in Microsoft Word, an IE window would pop up with the mail.yahoo.com webpage open. Basically, a browser window pointing to one's yahoo email replaced the normal Outlook or Express popping up for all email functions. This feature was very handy, but the download provided by Yahoo! only works with IE. I prefer Mozilla, and I would love to see the ability to do the same with this browser. See http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/mail/ext/ext-11.html for details on the Yahoo - Explorer download. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Click on any mailto: link OR click on "send as attachment" in a Microsoft Office document. 2. 3. Actual Results: Instead of a browser window with mail.yahoo.com popping up as Yahoo's download can cause when was uses Internet Explorer, Outlook pops up. Expected Results: Opened a browser window with Yahoomail. When using the mailto: link, the browser should have automatically entered the To: field. When using the "Send as attachment" in Office, it should have already attached the document and be ready for me to enter the To: field information. I know this is a very minor issue that only affects Yahoomail users that previously had Internet Explorer and used the download to make Yahoo a default email program. I'll file it as an enhancement request.</description>

These include, not are not limited to: Close, Print, Find, Reload, Page Source, Minimize, and Zoom. These items should be greyed out when they are not applicable like in other Mac OS X applications. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Close all open windows. 2. Click on any of the above menu items. 3. Actual Results: Nothing happens. Expected Results: The menu items should be greyed out and not selectable when there are no open windows since most of the items apply only to a window or its contents.</description>

While these Live Bookmarks share the bookmark GUI paradigm, they are in fact an aggregate of links rather more than a folder of bookmarks, and they should show whether a link has been visited before. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Click on a livemark folder 2. Click on a link in the folder 3. Click on the livemark folder again Actual Results: The contents of the livemark folder look exactly the same Expected Results: Firefox should have altered the presentation of the visited link in some way as to show that it had been previously visited. I think that making unvisited links bold and visited links unstyled would be OK.</description>

      <title>No way to set different button sizes for each toolbar (but default does have different sizes)</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0 On a completely clean Firefox profile, the icons size will be 'large' by default. However, if you customise the toolbars, and drag an icon onto the bookmarks toolbar, any and all icons you drag to it will be small icons. However, checking the 'use small icons' box will make them all small, and unchecking it will make them all large. After checking that box there is no way (that I could find) to regain the initial appearence of having large icons on the navigation toolbar, and small icons on the bookmarks toolbar. This makes me sad, because I really really want to get it back that way, but the only way to do so is to start a new profile. The large icons on the navi toolbar are pretty, but having them on the bookmarks toolbar makes it too big. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Start Firefox with a brand new, clean, never-before-used profile. 2. Right-click the navigation toolbar. Select 'customise'. 3. Drag an icon to the bookmarks toolbar (which will be open by default). Notice that although the icons on the navigation toolbar remain large, the one you just dragged to the bookmarks toolbar will be small. 4. Check 'use small icons'. All icons on both toolbars will switch to being small. 5. Uncheck 'use small icons'. All icons on both toolbars will switch to being large. Repeat steps 4-5 as often as you like, with the same results. Actual Results: There is no way to regain the initial (desired) behaviour after changing the setting, other than a profile wipe. Expected Results: There should be an option to have large icons on one toolbar, and small icons on another (as is, apparently, default behaviour).</description>

      <title>Forward button down-arrow should show a tree, not a list</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041118 Firefox/1.0 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041118 Firefox/1.0 The traditional browser Forward button is not very useful. Its only possible use is as quick "undo" after hitting the Back button. And that works only if you don't click any other link on the "back" page. What I've wanted for years is the ability to do the following: 1. Read page A.html 2. In the middle of reading, clink on a link on A.html to view page B.html 3. B is interesting, but I want to finish reading A first. Click Back to A. 4. Continuing A, I run into another link to page C.html. Click. 5. Back to finish A. ... N. Where's that page B.html I visited half an hour ago? The trouble at the step N is that the Forward button will show me only the last page I was at, not all of the pages I saw. So nowadays I usually open links in other tabs, but that leads up to a lot of clutter and a lot of tab-clicking. There must be a better solution, and there is: N+1: Click the Forward down-arrow and choose the desired page from the menu. In the scenario I described, the Forward down-arrow would contain a simple list of pages visited directly from the current page. The same menu today contains a list of the last "chain" of pages visited from the current page. The ideal form of the menu should present a tree of all pages visited from the current page. Here's a more complex scenario to illustrate this: 1. Read page A. 2. Follow a link from A to page B. 3. Follow a link from B to page C. 4. Back twice to A. 5. Follow a link from A to D. 6. Follow a link from D to E. 7. Back to D. 6. Follow a link from D to F. 8. Back twice to A. At this point, here's what the current Forward menu contains: D F Here's what the "forward tree" menu should look like: D F E B C If the traditional Forward menu contains a total of N pages, those same pages should be the first N items of the proposed Forward menu, except every item would be slighly indented from the previous one. I hope that takes care of backward compatibility. The remaining items in the tree represent the pages that were visited before from the current page, and backed out of. By the way, I believe this kind of tree organization (visited-from hierarchy) might be a better fit for the History panel than the current FireFox flat list of pages or the Mozilla suite's site/page two-level hierarchy. Most people don't care what site they're looking at, they see pages instead. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce:</description>

      <title>Make it possible to organise themes and extensions, rather than extensions appearing all over TOOLS drop down etc.</title>

I have around 10 extensions and many clutter up your TOOLS drop down list, making it very difficult to find the simple actions you expect in TOOLS. Not only this but the order is changed, TOOLS&gt;OPTIONS has now been moved to appear as the last but one in the drop down, which is very annoying in itself and makes the entire list look cluttered, confusing, and generally not attractive, or how it should look. There needs to be AT LEAST an extension to allow you to organise your extensions in various ways, one of which to add Themes &amp; Extensions into OPTIONS (makes sense and fits perfectly), then upon clicking on Themes or Extensions, all themes and extensions appear to the right in the box, rather than all over Firefox. This has the added benefit of removing not only Themes &amp; Extensions from the drop down, which many people dont want, but also all the extensions that clutter up the basic, easy to navigate organisation of Firefox. Also, another benefit of adding Themes &amp; Extensions to OPTIONS, or at bare minimum allowing for that to be possible somehow (this is supposed to be instantly customizable) is that when there are no extensions or themes installed, upon users browsing the OPTIONS area, as they often do, they will more likely realise and learn of the power and OPTIONS extensions and themes hold. A brief picture and text outline and description of themes upon clicking themes, and extensions upon going into extensions, could then be displayed on the right. This would show what options are really possible, and explain to them why the OPTIONS area is so simplistic to begin with, and what you can do to add options effectively (extensions) and themes.

      <title>Suggest making top buttons &amp; address bar look more like IE - to enhance market reach for Mozilla</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0) Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040913 Firefox/0.10.1 As I have tried Mozilla Firefox and regular Mozilla I've had a hard time sticking to using the browsers instead of IE for one main reason: The address bar doesn't come prepackaged so that it's over to the left. I, and I'm sure many others, have used IE for so long that when we try and switch to Mozilla our eyes and brains are expecting the address bar &amp; buttons to be in a certain place. Now I have been able to finally customize Firefox so that it looks how I expect &amp; am used to. But most users won't bother trying to figure out how to change the button &amp; address box layout. So when they try &amp; use Mozilla they may stop like I did because they'll come to really not like where the address bar is by default. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Try Mozilla Firefox &amp; regular Mozilla &amp; IE 5.5 or 6. 2. If you're a long time IE user you'll be bothered by how the address bar in the Mozillas is in a different place from where you expect. 3. You, as a common dumb user cannot figure out how to change the layout so that it looks more pleasing to you, and you probably don't know that changing the layout in an option in the first place. 4. So you switch back to IE and give up on Mozilla - which is bad of course. Actual Results: Normal user: Goes back to IE. Advanced user: Goes back to IE for a while until he figures out how to get the layout in Mozilla how he wants. Expected Results: Most users: Go back to IE.</description>

      <title>Have default settings for address box &amp; buttons more closely match what common users expect</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0) Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040913 Firefox/0.10.1 and Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040910 When IE users come to Firefox or regular Mozilla they find the address bar (box) is not where they expect. Most users won't know how to change the layout - most would not know that you can even change the layout. This results in people trying Mozilla then going back to the evil IE. I suggest making the "default" layout look more like IE and more like the images I've attached to this report - to enhance Mozilla's market share. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Be a regular dumb user. 2. Use IE for a long time. 3. Try Firefox or regular Mozilla. 4. Notice how the buttons &amp; address box/bar is not where your eyes or brain expects. 5. Dumb Mozilla &amp; go back to IE. 6. We've lost a user. As a more advanced user it took me a while to figure out how to change the layout &amp; to even bother. Most users won't bother. So why not have a layout which is more close to what people are used to. Actual Results: Most users: Trying Mozilla &amp; going back to IE. Advanced users: trying Mozilla &amp; going back to IE for a while until they figure out or bother to change the layout settings in Mozilla. Expected Results: Most users: going back to IE unless format is changed. Advanced users: going back to IE for a while until they figure out or take the time to change the layout in Mozilla.</description>

I think a good example for that ist the Opera Browser. An extension to that could be a session management. But a "Continue from last time"-Option would be wonderful. BTW: The link sais I can do a freature request here but it looks a bit more like a bu report form. Am I right here?

Specifying global proxy settings is ineffecient in these circumstances but not everyone has the know how to create a .pac file. It would be useful to have a .pac file creator built in. Something along the lines of: ---------------------- To reach: | Website 1 | ---------------- | Website 2 | use | Proxy server | | Website 3 | ---------------- ---------------------- With add site and server dialogues, etc. This would enhance use for many people and be especially appealing within corporate environments.

      <title>A preference for Ctrl-W to always keep one tab open instead of closing the window.</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0 Pressing Ctrl-W closes the current active tab. If there is only one active tab, then it closes the window. Closing the window is annoying if you have many tabs open, and you want to close them all, but also want the browser to stay open, as holding down ctrl-W closes everything. What is being requested is some way of specifying that one blank tab should always stay open instead of closing the window (e.g. via a preference, or a UI option, or a change to default behaviour - any mechanism is fine). A small patch that I use on my Firefox 1.0 installation to achieve this behaviour is as follows: From browser.jar, edit chrome\browser\content\browser\browser.js ~line 1372: ========================================================== function BrowserCloseTabOrWindow() { if (gBrowser.localName == 'tabbrowser' &amp;&amp; gBrowser.tabContainer.childNodes.length &gt; 1) { // Just close up a tab. gBrowser.removeCurrentTab(); return; } + if (gBrowser.localName == 'tabbrowser' &amp;&amp; gBrowser.mTabContainer.childNodes.length == 1) { + // If this is the last tab, open "about:blank" tab, and don't close the window + loadURI('about:blank', null); // still leaves back &amp; forward buttons active though + return; + } BrowserCloseWindow(); } ========================================================== Note that this patch has 2 problems though, which make it unsuitable for inclusion in its current form: 1) It doesn't check a pref (it's just a straight change to the default behaviour) 2) It leaves the back and forward buttons active (i.e. the user can press back, and get the previous page). [An alternative is to go "gBrowser.addTab('about:blank');" and then "gBrowser.removeCurrentTab();", which opens a new tab and then closes the current one, but this causes an ugly brief flashing effect.] Related bugs: 206142 and 253949. Note that those 2 reports defined the window-closing behaviour as buggy, whereas this report does not claim this behaviour is buggy (as the software is doing what it's been designed to do) - rather it requests some way of changing this behaviour to keep the window open when the last tab is closed.

While this might not seem necessary at first glance, this is for a browser that will be built off of Firefox.

      <title>auto-cluster bookmarks from the same site to bookmarks sub-folders</title>

Why not to let ist assist the user by auto-ordering bookmarks that relate to each other? A functionality that would place bookmarks from one site/domain to one folder would be a starting point. That woul take a lot of work from the user to keep his/her bookmarks in order. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: Hm, this is a wish. Should i have put it somewhere else? Well, if you want to reproduce it at all, then: 1. In sequence go to a set of web pages 2. add their addresses to the bookmarks collection Actual Results: 3. look at that collection: the bookmarks won't be auto-ordered. You'll have to do that by yourself. Um, i tried firefox last week and removed again; if your bookmarks manager does this service yet, then sorry for the entry here. Expected Results: Bookmarks manager should order the bookmarks automatically in a senseful way</description>

The plain hyphen should be interpreted by a user agent as just another character. The soft hyphen tells the user agent where a line break can occur. Those browsers that interpret soft hyphens must observe the following semantics: If a line is broken at a soft hyphen, a hyphen character must be displayed at the end of the first line. If a line is not broken at a soft hyphen, the user agent must not display a hyphen character. For operations such as searching and sorting, the soft hyphen should always be ignored. In HTML, the plain hyphen is represented by the "-" character (&amp;#45; or &amp;#x2D;). The soft hyphen is represented by the character entity reference &amp;shy; (&amp;#173; or &amp;#xAD;) In Mozilla Firefox 1.0 soft hyphen doesn't work at all. By the way, opera and ie correctly works. So, try to fix that in next release of your really great web browser. p.s. i'm from Russia and speaking english not very well.. Sorry. Vadim L Burmakin aka &lt;El Desperado&gt;. desperado@ipex.ru -- some facts: Windows XP SP2 English please mail me if you understand..

Expected Results: html output: "tryingto- viewthis- longword" table doesn't resized, string is sliced. IE loads this example correctly. This function is very usefull in HTML4.0 spec. So, fix this, please.</description>

I switch tabs and go to top all the time in Safari. Switch tabs can be done with Cmd(apple)+Right(or left of course). This quite easy and comfortable with one hand. Ctrl+tab and Ctrl+shift+tab are not as easy. You should make both usable. Also, and this is the more difficult one, those the shortcut for end/beginning of page is end/home this is not good for powerbook users, particularly those who are used to Safari. Safari uses Cmd+down(or up), which is one handed and easy. Your shortcut is not able to be done with one hand. Furthermore, I never use home/end/pgup/pgdown so i dont use the fn key much. Please add this functionality. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. open a few pages in tabs 2. try shortcut keys for change tabs and go to top/bottom of keys on a powerbook (note the inconvenience) 3. have a sandwich Actual Results: i got frustrated/thirsty Expected Results: allowed me to use the following shortcuts apple+up - go to top of page apple+down - go to bottom of page apple+shift+left - previous tab apple+shift+right - next tab</description>

I just cant see why someone wouldnt want to make their address bar a little smaller and their quick search bar a bit bigger to fit those long google searches, otherwise you have to move the carat over to see the rest of what you type if you just want to revise your search. Thanks for making such a great product, hats off sirs/madams.</description>

      <title>When dragging text to search bar, mouse over search engine should show list of search engines, and allow dropping text onto one to search that engine</title>
      <description>When selecting some text and dragging it to the search bar, hovering the mouse over the search engine icon should display the drop down list of search engines, and releasing the mouse over that search engine should instead search for that selected text in that engine. I don't think this would confuse most users just searching, as they usually don't drag text there when searching so they wouldn't notice this, but for advanced users this would be very, very cool. It might be an idea to perhaps have a small (0.5/1 second or so) delay before opening this up. We'd obviously want to hide the "Add Engines" from the list when dragging text like this to the search box, and perhaps other small visual things could be done (for example change the text for "Google" to "search Google" or even "search Google for &lt;start of text ending with... after X characters&gt;". Or perhaps have a heading at the top of the search engines list that says something like "search these engines for &lt;dragged text...&gt;" - just to keep it all tidy.</description>

Or, alternately, throw up a dialogue box ASKING if you want to quit all open windows if you accidentally quit one window without intending to quit all other open windows. Given the way people use computers now and the over-abundance of RAM rarely do I actually need to or intend to QUIT a web browser fully. Thanks.</description>

      <title>History should store referer info</title>
      <description>As browser history - from the beginning of Time - appears as an underexploited gem, I think it could be bettered by storing the referer (previous visited page) along with each history entry. That way, the history could be rendered "tree-like" instead of a plain list. Web statistic packages already compute that to know the browsing patterns of visitors - I think users might find that useful too. Maybe browsing in a tree-fashioned way should be accomplished by an extension, but I think that the problem core (storing the referer) belongs to the browser.</description>

For error messages produced by tabs without focus, the tab's text color and/or icon in the tab bar should change to notify the user that a message is waiting. Current modal dialog behavior should be available through the advanced section in the preferences dialog.</description>

Shouldn't be too difficult to implement. Just split the parameter string into as many parts as you have %s's.</description>

      <title>Importing IE favorites should preserve the display order</title>
      <description>Not actually a bug, but feedback from someone who is a regular FireFox user. My son Jeff is working on the help modules for you, and has me hooked. At work I just upgraded from 0.8 to 1.0 on my laptop. GM requires IE to be the default browser there. I imported my bookmarks from IE with no problem, but it really ticks me off that FireFox automatically alphebetizes the entire list. Rather than having folders at the top and some bookmarks in a logical order, I got bookmarks and folders all mixed up in alphabetical order. It will take me an hour to rearrange them in the order that I prefer. Second item, during setup I specifically did not check the box to make FireFox my home page. When it first opened, my carryover Yahoo home page did not appear as expected. Jim</description>

      <title>FireFox lacks Master Password Reset feature</title>
      <description>On my Microsoft Windows XP Professional, Version 2002, Service Pack 2, operating on the Pentium M at 1700 Mhz, with 1 GB of RAM, I am unable to load my personal PKI certificates. I don't this this is a Password Manger problem, but there is no component choice for "certificates" Using the autoform toolbar, I saved a password for a form. I was asked to set a master password. I did. I have since saved other passwords, when prompted I enter the master password, the password in the form is saved. I am trying to load my personal PKI certificates. It is in the format with *.pks. When I try to load the certificate, Firefox application opens a window which asks "Please enter the master password for the Software Security Device." I enter the master password I set previously, this does not work. A null entry does not work. When I got to Tools&gt;options&gt;advanced and go to Manage Security Devices I am unable to login to the Software Security Device, since I don't have it's master password. I can not change or set this password either, since I don't have the current password for the Software Security Device. Am I missing something? Please help. Regards, Richard Frear</description>

Note: I'm not asking to "Clear All" on exit (though some might), just the cache. I am happy keeping encrypted stuff around.</description>

      <title>can not delete search engines</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0 The documentation and references have a script to add search engines. I want to delete some and there is no obvious way to do so. The bug is in that the list becomes unmanageable since it can not be cleaned up. Second, if a search engine changes or closes down (as has happened), it can not be removed. I also choose not to have ebay associated with my activities and can not remove the reference. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.attempt to delete a search engine 2. 3. Actual Results: no option available Expected Results: There should be both and add and a delete option.</description>

      <title>RFE: Ability to Delete Search Engines</title>
      <description>Currently there is no way to delete search engines from the search bar from within Firefox. I propose that pressing [shift]+[del] while an engine on the drop-down list is selected should result in that engine being deleted (in the same way that a searched for phrase can be deleted). Also, I think there should be a "Remove search engines..." interface (accessible from the drop-down list) for doing this (for those who are not aware of the [shift]+[del] technique). (Ideally, it would be nice if there was a built-in search engine manager within Firefox for downloading &amp; adding, removing, enabling and disabling individual search engines, but that is another bug for the future.) This is very important because (as I noted in bug 266227) the developers of Firefox have decided to add many SEs by default which many people wouldn't ever use (e.g.: the top two are exactly the same SE and two of them are for shopping sites) and it is very difficult for users currently to replace them with SEs that are more appropriate to themselves. (BTW, is their a bug to discuss which SEs should be included by default?)</description>

      <title>Update Bookmarks</title>
      <description>Back in the days of Netscape Communicator there was a great feature that was left out of Mozilla/Firefox. There should be an update bookmarks feature that brings up a what's new menu. One can look for documents that have changed on all bookmarks or selected bookmarks. When one started checking this information, the icon of the bookmark would change if the page were updated since the last time the bookmark was visited. It would be a nice feature to adjust the bookmark for url changes or if a page no longer exists. The icon change for updates is a great feature that really helps the user. It is the only reason I personally have communicator still installed. Please add this enhancement so I can move on in my browser world!!</description>

      <description>When moving the cursor over a hypertext link on the browser window and the cursor changes to a hand icon it would be helpful to know before you click if the link would open on a new window or on the current.

      <title>Some suggestions for Items on the Help Menu</title>
      <description>Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8a6) Gecko/20041222 Firefox/1.0+ Firefox version of the Camino Bug 167428 "add access points from Help menu to release notes and readme (milestone-based)" At present, the Help menu has items: [Help Contents][Promote Firefox][About Mozilla] Examples of good help menus include Filemaker Pro [FileMaker Pro Help][Contents and Index][FileMaker on the Web][Send Feedback to FileMaker][Register Now] and BBEdit [BBEdit Help][BBEdit User Manual][Glossary Reference][Grep Reference][Preferences][Search Reference][Bare Bones Software Web Site][Bare Bones Software Tech Support][Register Your Copy of BBEdit][BBEdit Release Notes][BBEdit Support FAQ Page][BBEdit Product Updates Page][BBEdit Developer Info][Check for Update] Now whilst there may be room for improvement on both of these, they do act as pointers for what the Help Menu should contain. I have not been able to find a Bug for suggesting items on the Help Menu, so I am proposing to start this one, the idea being that people can add their suggestions here. [Firefox Help Cmd-?] [Help Contents] [Firefox User Manual] [Firefox on the Web] [Firefox Mozillazine] [Firefox Support] [Searching the Web] [Finding Text on a Web Page] [Web Development Best Practices] [Troubleshooting your Internet Connection] [Firefox Release Notes] [Firefox FAQ] [Firefox Updates] There are a few other things needed, but you will probably get the idea of providing safe entry points into the Mozilla web site, access to local documentation and simple guidance on using Firefox, and one simple, appropriate way to seek support. I would also suggest removing the link to 'Reporting Bugs' from the http://www.mozilla.org/support/firefox/ page (my intended destination for the sixth item on my list). There could be a new link created to 'See Bugs Reported Today' which was on the Suite, and I liked for its proof that the process of pushing Firefox forward is alive and well; and in this context, the suggestion that Bugzilla should be read rather than posted to. If possible, it would be good to have links to Bugzilla (particularly any that might encourage submitting simple requests as bugs) only from pages marked as Developer Info. Nightlies and Debug builds should include such info or links (something which was also in the Suite). I have thinking on these lines for over a year, and I was hoping to submit a complete patch to Camino (that project is Panther only); but what stimulated me to post today was coming across this message on Bug 275362 "'Report Issue' in Help menu", Comment #2 Bugzilla is a tool for the developers and it's no support database. A "normal" user wants support but support bug reports are invalid. A user must also read http://www.mozilla.org/quality/bug-writing-guidelines.html , check for dupes et cetera before he reports a bug into bugzilla. Your bug report also shows that the bug reporting quality is not very good: No Build ID/Version (such an entry could be already added), wrong severity, wrong component. suggesting wontfix which I suggest could be cleaned up (if necessary) and placed on either a support page such as I one I mentioned above, or a Bugzilla page. I was looking for this text to paste into Bug 275037 "crash with webster.com site". Getting Support Requests out of Bugzilla (in the sense of not getting them in here in the first place) is really a two way process, see these articles which may be a little elementary for the readership here: http://freshmeat.net/articles/view/149/ and http://freshmeat.net/articles/view/1082/ (I am not sure that there is yet a Mozilla Web Development Best Practices Page anywhere on the Web, again it is something that I have felt the lack of for many months, but there is one for Safari which reads as though it was written by a Mozilla developer originally ...)</description>

      <title>enable simultaneously instances of FF on different machines to share bookmarks</title>
      <description>I'm using sync2it.com service for synchronizing bookmarks/favorites between 7 pc, most running Firefox, and 2 of them both firefox and IE. The service is great, but there is a problem because Firefox does not recognise that the sync2it client makes changes to the bookmark file while Firefox is active. Firefox just overwrites the bookmarks file when closing... This is of course a major problem as all pc's are used simultanious, and changes may come at any time from any pc. Acording to sync2it developer this might be a leftower from netscape behaviour... Suggest to make Firefox recognise external changes - and doing a re-read - or maybe to let Firefox save only changes on exit. If there is any good reason to keep this behaviour in Firefox - please tell so. I've been searching the forum, but found no mention on this topic...</description>

My native language is Russian, so I have many troubles with character encodings cos some sites print wrong Content-Encoding &amp; Content-Language headers or don't print them at all, so Firefox is to guess the right encoding. My suggestion is to made an option to "force a specific encoding", because nowadays firefox switches to ISO-8859-1 by default and I have to change the encoding manually every time I refresh a page from russian part of driverheaven.net forums.</description>

      <title>"I'm feeling lucky" keyword search should inform user the first time it is used</title>
      <description>When a user enters something which triggers the "I'm feeling lucky" keyword search (from the location bar), FireFox should pop up a window that informs the user what they have done. In addition, it would provide the option on that window to disable the feature. This popup would only be shown the first time that this event is triggered. Currently, the keyword search is quite confusing to new users who do not understand it. If a user does not know about the feature, and accidentally enters an invalid URL, then it can take them to a site completely unrelated to the one that they intended to go to, with no warning. This popup would inform the user that they have started a search. It would then give them the option to continue, cancel, or completely disable the auto-search feature. There should also be a checkbox (checked by default) that would say to not show this message again.</description>

      <description>It's annoying to have to tell Firefox whether to allow cookies for a particular site over and over again, every time I access that site. Once I make this choice in the "Allow cookies?" dialog (the one with "Allow", "Allow for Session", "Deny", and "Cancel" buttons) for a particular site, that choice needs to stay in effect whenever I access that site -- even in later sessions -- unless I explicitly change it.</description>

However, a Google-like keyword search would be far more useful. For example, sometimes I want to recall a recent Google search. I can press Ctrl+H and type "google" into the quicksearch bar, but I may need to narrow it down further. Say I want a search about Linux. So I type in "google linux", expecting to see all Google searches related to linux. Instead I get Zarro results. The HTML title of the Google result page is "Google Search: search terms"--in this case, "Google Search: linux image organizer"--but when I type in "google linux", I get nothing. Instead I have to type in "google search linux". That, obviously, is counter-intuitive. A keyword search would be far more useful here. Then I could simply type "google whatever" and get all recent Google searches that included the "whatever" keyword, and I could also narrow it down by adding another keyword.

      <title>Anti-ads blocker improvement</title>
      <description>It would be nice to have the following: pop-up blocker was nice, but there is other kinds of annoying things. Especially, flash content that overlaps a webpage, banners and similar. From a given web page right click... select block and have a list of fetched url domains and then block such web content. Blocking specific "script,object,embed,img,a href" section would be nice also. for instance, http://ads.xxxx.com/ads/content.php?src=...' Meaning that firefox should not download any content from there, unless unblocked from now on, wether it is: text, flash, images, video, music or anything else. putting a placeholder download link red box - [blocked] instead which can be downloaded if you click on it. For instance, a user might want to see: http://my.com/content.swf but not: http://my.com/banner.swf http://my.com/intro.wav It saves some bandwidth on slow connection and it avoids seeing unwanted and undesired ads or content. Of course the block should be sorted by subdomain, path, file, file type. Even using Regexp blocking would be nice if possible. Such that one could discriminate at various degree globally or only for a given site. One way before was to not have the flash player, but that doesn't always work since some website really needs flash. Sincerely yours, Fred</description>

      <description>These days there are web ads that utilize iframe to load an ad banner in other sites and it's not easy to block them only by image blocking, so I'd like to see a block based on iframe href in Firefox Web Features. (Personally I'd like to have a more programmable/generic blocker applicable to any tags, though I assume iframe block is the bottomline of non-bloat here...) Just FYI I'm on Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8a6) Gecko/20041227 Firefox/1.0+</description>

      <title>The only way IE is better is that when a webpage is found I want to print, I can shrink or increase the typesize for the printed document, but this is not possible--and would be more difficult if it were--in Firefox.</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0 In IE, but not in Firefox, when I change the type-size onscreen I also change it on the resulting printed document. This feature should also be available in Firefox. At present, when one changes onscreen typesize, that change is NOT reflected in the resulting printed document. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Compare IE w. Firefox, by first finding a webpage you want to print. 2. Go to "Print Preview" and let's asume it shows that the document is 6 pages. 3. Let's say you want to print it complete in only 3 pages. 4. In IE, you go "Back" "View" "Type Size" and have six sizes to choose from, and whichever one you choose WILL be reflected in the resulting printed document. That's NOT the case in Firefox. Actual Results: As described. Expected Results: As described.</description>

      <title>Enter new URL in address bar should open new tab automatically</title>
      <description>I suggest that you add the following feature to Firefox. If you go to the address bar and enter a new URL, it takes your current tab to the new address. I think it would be very useful to give the user the option to either: 1) Change the current tab to the new address (the way it works now) OR 2) Open a new tab and take you to the new address Ideally, this would be an option under the "Tabbed Browsing" section of the options Advanced menu.

      <title>resizeable windows for URL and Search in Navigation Toolbar</title>
      <description>I suggest that the URL window and the search window be resizeable in the navigation toolbar. Some people like to have a huge URL window buy a very small search window. Others prefer the opposite. If those windows were resizeable, then the user could customize it to their preference. Of course, if it is resizeable, it would probably also be nice to let the user "lock" the toolbar once he/she has sized it to their preference. Thank you. Brian Reeves</description>

      <title>One major, one minor, suggested enhancement.</title>
      <description>1. I noticed Firefox was much slower than my existing Navigator. I was about to go back to Navigator. I finally found why: there is a default setting "Options/Advanced/Tabbed Browsing/Select new tabs opened from links" that is turned OFF. Not logical. If a person clicked on a link, the person wants to see link. But, more importantly, in Navigator it defaults to opening in the new tab and you could start reading the news or whatever in that new tab, even as it continued to load. What I was doing was hitting the link in Firefox, then waiting for the new tab to completely load before clicking on the tab. Firefox therefor seemed "slower." Once I turned this setting ON, Firefox had the same speed as Navigator and responded to links as Navigator did. Because most users wouldn't find this option, which is a bit cryptic, and would probably go back to Navigator is they were like me, I strongly suggest changing the default from OFF to ON. 2. I also noticed the default is "OFF" for "Options/Advanced/Tabbed Browsing/Select new tabs opened from links". This is the same setting as Navigator, and I never liked it. Say I'm in my browser and notice of an email comes in; I go the the email and click on some URL within the email. It then overwrites overwrites the site I was just looking at in my browser. Not logical. If someone clicks on a link from another application, they don't logically want to lose any site they have on their browser. It's not vital like the one above, but because most users wouldn't find this option (which is a bit cryptic), I would suggest changing the default to "ON" for this option. Thanks very much for all you folks have done.</description>

      <description>If you toggle the offline mode in Firefox it doesn't effect the Windows global online/offline setting. Thus you end up having to open IE to toggle the setting to start certain apps. Is there any chance that at least an option that allows firefox to change the registry setting for this would be possible?</description>

      <title>Plug-In blocker idea: block plug-in usage for certain sites</title>
      <description>First a story behind my idea: I was playing on a game site with java and these Macromedia Flash ads that appear always stall or slow down my game for some reason. The reason does not matter in this case, but then it got me thinking, if Firefox can block Pop-up Windows, why not block usage of plug-ins for sites of your choosing? Behold (da da da daaaa!) the Plug-In Blocker! This feasable idea would be implanted in the web features section of the properties window, you add a site to the list and then you select the plug-ins that are not to be used at all on that site! If there is an applet using the program on the page, you know when you het that puzzle piece when plug-ins are required? You would get a picture of a plug with a lock on it (or whatever the theme specifies) with the message "Plug-in Blocked, click here to activate it for this session if needed" or something like that. This is a feasable idea and might actually work.</description>

      <title>quick search bookmark when clicked, should search text selections</title>
      <description>If I set up a bookmark with a keyword and '%s' in the URL, I know I can open it by typing it in the location bar. It would also be nice if I could open it by *clicking* on it from the 'Bookmarks' menu or the 'Bookmarks Toolbar'. And since I am not explicitly typing in any search text, it should search any *selected text( that I select on the current webpage. Scenario 1: Everytime I want to search 'Dictionary.com' for a word from a webpage, I have to: [mouse], select, copy, [keyboard], type 'dict', paste, enter. I recently discovered Jesse Ruderman's Bookmarklets (http://www.squarefree.com/bookmarklets/) which allowed me to directly add a javascript bookmark to my 'Bookmarks Toolbar' so I can just [mouse], select, click bookmark button. But then I thought, not everyone knows javascript, so not everyone will know how to create a Bookmarklet for their favorite searches. And also, I already have a bookmark-search for Dictionary.com so why can't I merge them both together? Hence this enhancement request.</description>

      <title>Firefox should scroll like Safari rather than Camino</title>

Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Scroll with the mouse wheel Actual Results: Scrolling requires more movement of the mouse wheel to travel the same distance on the page. Expected Results: Scrolling works as before. I was going to tag this onto the end of bug 314856 and ask that it be reopened, but decided this was more productive since the problem the user had really should be addressed, just not in a way that made things worse for non-trackpad users. I'm filing this as an RFE because I can live with it as-is or keep using 11/28 in the meantime and this might need an enhancement added to suitably fix. I don't use a Mac laptop, but the first step seems to be... 1) Find out what Safari scrolls like with the trackpad. Josh said he has a Powerbook, so that seems pretty straightforward. Darren Stone gave some numbers in his comment (#9) in bug 314856. Safari rather than generic Cocoa applications should be used for comparison since that's what users are going to be comparing the Moz browsers to. 2) Adopt that behavior (for Camino as well). 3) If it's not possible to do (e.g. Apple is doing something to accomodate trackpad users that just isn't feasible for Firefox) then expose a method to adjust the scaling to users through prefs (about:config type access is fine, though it'd probably be friendlier if you had a "trackpad scrolling" checkbox in advanced with auto- and smooth scrolling for people who wanted the non-scaling behavior). This might be welcome on other operating systems but this was a change to the Mac event handler so Mac OS X is where this is filed. It's worth looking at Darren's comment in 314856 again just to see how much of a difference this makes to mouse-wheel users in the real world. 3) And just for the sake of consistency, Firefox should scroll the same number of lines when using the keyboard arrow keys. Safari does the same 3 they do with a mouse wheel increment, Camino does about 2, Firefox currently does 1. Both Moz products should do the same as a mouse wheel increment (so normally 3 like Safari). This would have the side effect of making Firefox feel faster to users without actually doing anything to improve scrolling performance. Scrolling by clicking on the scrollbar arrows is probably fine as-is, though someone should probably look into why it's so much worse on Camino one of these days.</description>

I always have many tabs open at once, but don't believe there is a keyboard shortcut for navigating between them. I believe this would also improve accessibility for whom using a mouse is not easy. I would prefer having 2 keyboard shortcuts for moving left &amp; right through the open tabs in the current Firefox window. Perhaps Ctrl-Left Arrow and Ctrl-Right Arrow?

      <title>Support xul directory browsing</title>
      <description>I'd like Firefox to support xul directory browsing. That'd mean that it'd have to do something *useful* when setting the pref network.dir.format to 3, instead of leave users with empty pages when trying to get file:/// or ftp:/// directory views. Note that at the moment, it actually *tries* to do something useful, but fails because of: No chrome package registered for chrome://communicator/content/directory/directory.xul Of course, this all works fine in Seamonkey/Mozilla Suite.</description>

      <title>Accessing local files from Intranet pages</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5 There is an old bug (#84128) which talks about a missing reaction by Firefox if a user clicks on a file: URL on an Intranet page. This bug here is to collect votes to get a proposed solution fixed: When a user clicks on a file: URL (ideally anywhere but for starters, it would be sufficient if it would from from HTML pages), a message will be display: "For security reasons, access to [file:] has been blocked. This is to protect you from malicious websites which try to access your data." The user must now be presented with these options: "Deny access" and "Allow access for [http:...]". The allow-rule must support patterns (to allow to add a whole range of sites like the different company servers with "http://*.company.com") and it must support to restrict the access for certain pages (like when you have a site which contains safe parts and public forums). Ideally, the first version should present a text field with the current URL of the page and a couple of examples how to change it and what the change would mean. Example: The page which tried to open the file was "http://www.firefox.com/forum/thread.php?id=15467" Now the UI should show these options: 1. "Never allow access to local files from this site [www.firefox.com]" 2. "Allow the access just this once." 3. "Allow the access just for the current page and remember this decision." 4. "Allow all pages on the server www.firefox.com to access local files. Note: If there are pages on this server which anyone can change, you're creating a large security threat!" 5. Allow all pages on any server in the domain firefox.com to access local files. Note: Just like #3, this can be a huge security threat. Imagine someone adds a new site to the network which contains a public forum." 6. Add the following pattern to the list of sites which can access local files: [text field with the URL here]. Note: Expert option! Use with care! Buttons: "Deny access", "OK". Pressing OK should save the selection and then process with the choice (ie. if the user allowed the access, it should open the file). In the security prefs, there must be a page to edit these settings. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: See all those other bug reports.</description>

What I envision is some thing that would replace the cuss word with a custumizable string, or random $%^%&amp;% characters. Such that the user could change the string for each word so F--- could be replaced with fudge, and A-- with Butt. (or what ever word the user wants) Another key componet would be that users could add their own words. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.Go to any forum 2. 3.

      <title>Suggested mousing improvements for calendar widget</title>
      <description>Double clicking a day on the calendar widget should select that day's entire week. Triple clicking a day on the calendar widget should select the entire month. Selection should only happen with the left mouse button; middle and right clicking should not affect the selection. Dragging past the top/bottom of the calendar should scroll the calendar up/down. Clicking the date should allow users to jump to a specific month/year. Clicking the arrows should only work with the left mouse button; middle and right clicking should not activate the arrows. Shift-clicking should extend the selection to the new point. Ctrl-clicking should add/remove the selected day from the selection.</description>

Say, for example, I would like to have form information for every site but eBay saved, I would go into the Form Preferences under Privacy options, click "Exceptions" (or whatever), and add "ebay.com". Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.Open preferences 2.Click Privacy-&gt;Saved forms Actual Results: There is no way to specify which sites you do not want to save a form for. Expected Results: Have a button called "Exceptions" that lets you specify sites you do not wish to have form information saved for.</description>

      <title>"links" on jafi.tapuz.co.il don't show as "read"/"visited" color</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5 It's a feature that IE has and Firefox doesn't have. Some forums, such as the example I gave, hold the messages' content within a span/div. Clicking on a message's title changes a CSS display property from "none" to "block" to display the message content. MSIE keeps the message titles in its history, so when you refresh the forum page you can see which messages you have already read (they're colored as vlinks). Firefox doesn't. I may have been kind of vague.. see the "steps to reproduce" :) Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open the example URL (http://jafi.tapuz.co.il/tapuzforum/main/forumpage.asp?id=272) 2. Click on a message title (below the "add message" line) to view message contents. 3. Refresh. Actual Results: If you use MSIE the message title is colored as vlink. If you use Firefox the message title is colored as an unvisited link. Expected Results: The message title to be colored as a visited link (vlink/purple) Other people experience that too, and I don't know of any Firefox users who don't. In addition, while the source code of my example is long and confusing, similar, simple html pages that I've written produced the same problem so it's not the tapuz.co.il website's fault.</description>

      <title>Alt+Q (providing @) on PC with German keyboard resembles to Quit on Mac Keyboard (Apple-Q)</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5 This is not strictly a firefox problem but maybe something firefox/thunderbird(!) can maybe help prevent from happening. It turns out that on the German PC-keybord the "@"-character is located on Alt-Q. On the Apple keybord, the Apple-key is in place of the "Alt" key, and Apple-Q closes the open application. When closing by Apple-Q, neither Firefox nor Thunderbird ask "are you sure" but just close, no saving of entered data. Consequently, I and others I know keep accidently throwing away emails when trying to, for example, add an address. Since I am re-trained every day at work for the PC-Layout, it seems impossible to overcome this annoyance. My question is, if one could implement an optional "are you sure" dialougue if the application is closed by Apple-Q (and maybe the window by Apple-W). Millions of Germans and Austrians will be greatfull ;-)) Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Use a German PC at work and send a few emails per day. 2. Use a Mac with German Keyboard at home and write e-mails, fill web-forms, ... 3. Try to use the "@" character with your backbone moving your fingers in the same way they do at work. Actual Results: The window/application closes imediately without saving the data you just typed in. Expected Results: If the espective option is set, a warning dialog appears after you pressed Apple-Q, asking if I really want to close Firefox/Thunderbird (maybe same thing for Apple-W, but not as urgent) A small step for a programmer, but a large leap for german Mac-users ;-))</description>

Here's an example: I go to a fatwallet.com, click on the hot deals forum, then accidentally hit the Go button. The URL history thinks I put this URL in there when I didn't, so it saves it. I never type this URL in again, but it leaves it there because I visited the URL multiple times by clicking on my fatwallet.com URL history item, then clicking on the hot deals forum link. The only choice currently is to purge all my URL history and re-enter everything. Or convert those items to bookmark entries of course. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.go to a web site's root page 2.click on a forum area 3.click the go button 4.notice the forum area's URL is put in the URL history even though you didn't type it in 5.wait a few weeks (while still visiting site 1 and clicking through to the forum) 6.notice that the forum URL is still in the URL history Actual Results: - extra URL history entries are not purged as expected - extra URL history entries are entered when you don't expect them to be Expected Results: - Go button stores URL that you browsed to when it should really store URLs that you typed in - extra URL history entries should be purged if you don't visit them directly (if you click through and visit the URL, the history should purge it because you didn't go to it from the menu) I'd like the Bookmarks editor to be able to be used to edit the URL history so we have full manual control over it.

As projects are worked, we have a need to retain web pages that contain intranet and internet information and store them for later research. We would like to keep such content in PDF format. Currently you can save the current page to postscript and then use ps2pdf to convert that page to PDF. The problem with that is that once it moved into PS format all of the text is lost and the result PDF doesn't contain the text strings found in the original page. This causes problems: 1) Search engines like Beagle won't discover this content, because it's a 'picture' and not 'text'. 2) You cannot use the 'Find' command in Adobe Acrobat to search these PDFs for strings. 3) You cannot copy and paste back out of these PDFs into other software applications. What we are requesting is a way to export the current page into a PDF document directly from Firefox in a manner similar to OpenOffice.org where it's a 'text' type document. What we propose is adding another checkbox in the print dialog that says []Print to PostScript File []Print To PDF File. Thanks. Reproducible: Always</description>

      <title>RFE: Manual "stop" key, to stop all animated content.  Different from #17686</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.12) Gecko/20050921 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.12) Gecko/20050921 This class of issue has been closed by bug #17686, which created a preference item to stop *all* animated content. That's fine, but not what I or advertisers want. I'm happy to see the animation the first time. But I'd like a manual "stop" feature. This used to be the "ESC" key. It worked good. Where did it go? This bug report is most similar to #32513, which has been closed and can't be reopened. I'm creating a new report to reopen discussion in to the manual-stop approach. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Visit a site with lots of animated images. 2. Try to get other work done on your computer. 3. Get frustrated. 4. Press ESC a few times, in hopes that the animation will stop. 5. Report this as a bug on mozilla.org again, as others have done in the past. Expected Results: The "ESC" key could stop all animaged gifs, and pause all flash animations. What it should do with javascript is an open question. One line of thought is that it should suspend all javascript timers. What do others think? Please read this bug in the context of a manual STOP feature, not a global preference.</description>

      <title>meta security bug, per chofmann's question</title>

A2: try to implement some kind of heap protection via canaries among blocks. this eventually may stop some bugs and help find buffer overflows, but in a multithreaded code that heavily uses C++ objects, it will not be very effective. if implemented in debug builds, may be used for real world testing. something like libfence may be effective for catching overflows at the moment they occur, but last time i checked the memory penalty was rather big (not quite sure, though) more on technical means for mitigation of exploitability later. probably this draft may apply to parasitic entities selling linux solutions while hypocritically claiming that linux is not ready for the desktop, but don't care much. sorry for sounding like a female lawyer, but don't have a magic wand.

      <title>[mac] installer hard to use -- Improve by including Unix symbolic link to Applications folder</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5 The Mac OSX installer can be dramatically improved by creating a symbolic link on the disk image to the Applications folder; creating an Arrow icon and simple instructional tex, "To install Firefox/Thunderbird drag its icon to the Applications Folder." Here's a review of the installer in Tidbits, a popular weekly 'zine http://www.tidbits.com/tb-issues/TidBITS-809.html#lnk1 "Ironically after my article about simplifying installation in TidBITS-807, the Firefox disk image provides only graphical instruction that's actively confusing. An arrow leads from the Firefox icon itself to a smaller, greyed-out version of the Firefox icon that is presumably being dragged, to judge from the non-Mac-like pointer and + badge, and then to a greyed-out icon that looks like the Applications folder. Unfortunately, it's all representational - the Applications folder is just a picture, and not a symbolic link, and there are no textual instructions to clarify what to do. I've already heard of people not realizing they had to copy the Firefox package and instead running it from the disk image. Worse, the instructions on the Firefox Web site say "double click the Firefox Disk Image to open it in Finder, and then drag the Firefox application onto your hard disk. Drag the icon to your Dock if you want it to appear there." I'm sure there are people who will promptly drag the Firefox icon from the disk image to the Dock, instead of copying it to the Applications folder and then dragging the copied version's icon to the Dock. Obviously, there's nothing all that hard here, but that's no reason not to make it easier yet." Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Create a symbolic link to the Applications folder. In the terminal type: ln -s /Applications ~/Desktop Move this link to the disk image. http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2005/09/02/easy-access-to-application-folder-from-a-disk.html has a great description and screenshots</description>

I'm wondering if it's related to bug 52821. But if so, please restore it, at least as an option in preferences. Ideally, you'd enable to gtk method of pressing a key combination when a menu item is selected to set that as a keyboard shortcut for future use. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.

Because I use the Bookmarks Toolbar Folder (this could get confusing...) to hold various Live Bookmarks and folders, I will occasionally middle-click a folder there when I go to close a tab, or open a link near the top of the page in a tab. This suddenely creates a large number of tabs, bogging the browser down and effectively destroying my session. According to this thread on MozillaZine, this functionality can't be disabled, which I think counts as a bug: http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=314259 Sorry if this has been reported before, every search I tried turned up hundreds of results! Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Middle-click a folder or live bookmark.

      <title>Allow whitelist of javascript by site</title>
      <description>imho the noscript extension - https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?application=firefox&amp;id=722 provides very nice funcionality of whitelisting javascript/plugins to specific domains/sites. having in mind its popularity on addons.mozilla.org (second place at the moment, 234 641 donwloads) a lot of ff users are interested in its functionality. is it possible including it (or its functionality) in official firefox? this may have the advantage of preventing javascript exploits while keeping the functionality of "trusted" sites. the noscript extensions is under GPL according to its licence, but couldn't find its source. iirc the noscript functionality may be achieved via preferences, so only a front end is needed (may be wrong on this).</description>

      <title>[META] Make toolbars more robust and intuitive</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5 This bug will consolidate a list of bugs which deal with toolbar usability. Here is an initial synopsis of some of the issues. 1. Toolbar names (as listed in the "View" menu) have no fixed relation to their contents so, for example, the "Bookmarks toolbar" may have other items placed in it which can cause confusion if the user attempts to hide the bookmarks toolbar item. (Bug 287686) 2. Custom toolbars are unintuitive. (Bug 212990) 3. Dragging toolbar items should provide better feedback than a slightly different cursor (a mostly transparent copy of the item for example). (Bug 318052) 4. The "Go" button should be somehow linked to the "Location" bar. (Bug 257561) 5. Only the "Bookmarks toolbar" item handles overflow. It would be nice if all toolbar items (including the menu) handled overflow. These issues might seem only slightly related but there is a simple solution for most of them. All toolbar buttons could be placed into groups (i.e., &lt;toolbaritem&gt;) and the "View &gt; Toolbars &gt; name" could be linked to the toolbar group instead of to the toolbar. This is my first meta bug so forgive me if I've covered too much, or not enough. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce:</description>

If you visit such a mixed page then a warning message pops up. But you have check a box in that message to get such alerts for other mixed pages in the future, if you just click OK then there are no future warnings. Even if you slect to be warned then you only get a warning when you visit such a page that only has an OK button. After you click the button then the page loads, including the nonsecure content. Internet Explorer handles this better. In IE it is not configurable if you get this warning or not, there is no "don't show me again" checkbox or setting. Also the message box in IE says "this page contains both secure and nonsecure items, do you want to display the nonsecure items?" Replying "No" will result in only the secure content being loaded. In general all the security.warn_* behaviour should be reversed. You should get these boxes until you click "don't show me again", instead of the current set where you have click "continue showing me these warnings".

      <title>Titles for text/plain pages should be non-empty (port of Mozilla bug 120630)</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5 I wasn't able to find a Firefox version of Mozilla bug 120630, so opening this. It sucks that the title for text/plain windows is simply "Mozilla Firefox" -- this makes it especially difficult to correctly select between multiple open windows with text/plain content. I would vote for making the title be the URL of the document (with " - Mozilla Firefox" appended, as usual), as that is what is (now) used for the title of the tab (was "(Untitled)" at the time bug 120630 was filed) and in the Back and Forward menus. However, another option would be to use the final non-'/' text, as suggested by the author of bug 120630: page served as text/&lt;not-html&gt; title for window, tab, and history ------------------------------------------------------------------------- http://foo/ foo http://foo/bar bar http://foo/bar/ bar http://foo/bar/baz baz Perhaps we also want to use the shorter file name names for bookmarking too, rather then the full URL? This would match what is currently done in the Go menu. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce:</description>

      <title>Pressing tab for location bar autocomplete should only complete up to longest common prefix (instead of selecting first item)</title>

When hitting "tab" in the location bar after entering a partial URL, the filled in URL should be the longest URL-substring of all matching URLs in the location history. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Type something like "mo" into the location bar. 2. Hit tab. Actual Results: Assuming you have several URLs that start with "mo" in your history, step 1) will start listing them, as it should. 2) will then fill in the location bar with the first url in the list. Expected Results: On top of actual result step 2 should select all but the largest prefix matching your history. Something like "mozilla.", if the only things in your history are "www.mozilla.com" and "www.mozilla.org". In this way you can continue writing from the largest common prefix. The described behavior would strike a compromise between unix style tab completion and current behaviour. I have a patch almost done.</description>

With javascript function I can add my message into the little window of confirmation with IE: window.event.returnValue = message; With firefox, I can get the same funciton by: e.preventDefault(); But I can't add the message. Maybe in the next verison you can add the parameter, so it can be used as: e.preventDefault(message); Here we can add the message into the little window of the confirmation. With Java or C++ its easy to do it, isn't it ? My best regards. Reproducible: Always</description>

      <title>[RFE] Warn against cross-site https submission (to avoid possible exploits)</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051223 Camino/1.0b1+ Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051223 Camino/1.0b1+ This is a low to moderately likely (but highly severe) risk that could be addressed with a simple warning (similar to HTTP/HTTPS warning dialog). Scenario: Crackers divert their attention from phishing emails to cracking smaller ISPs. Once they've cracked the ISP, they change the DNS for all popular banks to point to their fake bank websites. These sites have a one-line/invisible frame that then re-encapuslates the bank website with a valid SSL certificate for the phishing site. At present, there is no way for the user to know that the are submitting their bank credentials to an exploit website -- because the URL is the valid and correct one (other than looking at the source, and who can decipher bank HTML/JavaScript? :-) Proposed solution: Introduce a new warning dialog that displays if: i) You are submitting a password to a secure (HTTPS) website ii) The host/domain you are submitting the password to is *different* than the one in the location bar. Very strict mode would require exactly the same host (e.g. myciti.citibank.com) Strict mode would require only the same domain (e.g. citibank.com) No strict mode would provide no warning (as now) Very strict and strict modes would likely catch many websites out (especially ASP ecommerce sites that post from the shop to the ecommerce agent), but this may actually be a good thing (leading to better design of ecommerce transactions). OTOH, it could be something that people only selectively switch on, when they are doing their banking (or it could be by a list of opt-in sites, as for allowing pop-ups). Whilst the likelyhood of this exploit is low at present, I think it is likely, given the level phishing activity. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Create your own DNS server as authoritative for your network/host 2. Save your bank website's login page 3. Change the DNS for your bank 4. Create a one-line/invisible HTML frame which includes the saved HTML from (2) but uses a valid SSL cert for your host/domain. 5. See no warnings that you are about to give your credentials to an phishing website. Actual Results: Lots of money lost :-) Expected Results: Browser warning, similar to HTTP =&gt; HTTPS dialog</description>

Yet some pages, like the "Problem loading page" pages, have a different look &amp; feel. I propose the creation of a project whose aim is to create a user interface style for XUL rendered within the browser, which would have at least these goals: 1. It should be obvious to the user that he's not viewing a website. 2. The UI should look the same across all platforms. Reproducible: Always</description>

When I open the bookmarks sidebar (Ctrl+B) or am in Manage Bookmarks, and I try to search for a keyword, then all the live bookmarks show up in the search. I can see how this is a feature. But it can be annoying too: suppose I have the above URL included as a bookmark, and then search for the keyword "linux". I have dozens of bookmarks which match that keyword, so my static bookmarks are buried inside all of the live ones. It would be nice to have an checkbox or toggle button when viewing bookmarks to ignore live bookmarks. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Add a live bookmark such as the included URL to the Personal Toolbar 2. Manage Bookmarks or Ctrl+B 3. In the search box, enter a common keyword for the live bookmarks 4.

      <title>Limit inactive tabs to just urls when memory limit exceeded</title>
      <description>I find I have multiple firefox windows open, each with thirty or so tabs. Firefox grows until it falls over, and it's time to launch a new browser. But most of these tabs are used as aide-memoires, and are rarely accessed. All that matters is the url to retrieve the tab content, not the page content itself. If the page is likely stateless (no forms with user-entered text, no POST or ? GET state in the URL), then don't store the page in memory, just the url for the tab, and reload the page if the tab is selected. A tabbed page could be decreased to a tab-and-url if a memory limit for the browser is exceeded, or if the tab has been inactive for some time (likely an hour or more). Not storing old inactive tabs, but restoring them on access, would decrease firefox memory and CPU use, and increase perceived stability.</description>

Suppose you speak English and Spanish. Then there are about twenty different language codes to add (Spanish/Spain, Spanish/Uruguay) and so on. Because the list in the dialogue box is small, if you wanted to move Spanish/Spain to a higher position than the other variants of Spanish you need to press 'move up' lots of times and the selected entry disappears from view. Suggested enhancements: Make the dialogue box physically bigger so more of the list of chosen languages can be shown at once. Don't make the user add every variant of Spanish separately. It should be possible to add them all as accepted languages in one go. Perhaps when you choose Spanish this should implicitly include Spanish/Spain, Spanish/Mexico and so on. Or you may think that it is not necessary to add each and every variety of Spanish to the configuration and that just specifying 'es' will be enough. If so, this needs to be made clear to the user. If the many different variants of Spanish, English and French in the list of languages are not really useful and not something that a typical speaker of those languages would need to configure, then just remove them. A traditional two-panel view with 'add' and 'remove' buttons would probably be an easier way to manage the list. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce:</description>

When served over the web, it is important that the server note that the file is gzip (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=308153). All other things being as they should, firefox will download the svgz, uncompress the content, and display the svg file quite reliably. But when trying to view an svgz file stored locally on your hard drive, firefox will fail to open the file. (A dialog will pop up asking what you want to open it with). Also, while working with files locally: If you create an html file, and try to embed the svgz in it, Mozilla will display the xml parsing error (which is the error displayed when the file hasn't been sent with "Content-encoding: gzip": but it isn't practical for your os to send this encoding). In contrast to all other image formats, I've not found a way to display svgz in mozilla locally. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Ask mozilla to open a local svgz file directly, or Ask mozilla to open a local web page containing a local svgz file. 2. 3. Actual Results: Opening fails. Expected Results: Mozilla might display the svg file contained in the svgz.</description>

      <title>add simple protection against phishing/MITM</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5 To protect not just against normal phishing, but even against a real-time man-in-the-middle attacks, the following approach seems to provide decent protection where firefox can play an essential role in: 1) the user intends to visit https://myTrusted.site.org and clicks on *a* https - link 2) to log in, she clicks on the bottom right lock of her Firefox. Firefox copies a 6-(or longer?) character (ASCII) SSL/TLS session identifier into the clipboard. This identifier is calculated by Firefox as follows: Take the handshake_messages of http://www.rfc.net/rfc2246.html#s7.4.8. (since MITM are typically prevented when client certificate authentication is done, it only entails (and applies to) the messages of a handshake without client cert auth) and digest them until the result fits into the "identifier". 3) The user opens passwordsafe or an equivalently trustworthy open source utility 4) upon right-clicking on the previously stored password entry of myTrusted.site.org in the passwordsafe list, it does a HMAC(password,identifier), where HMAC is a keyed-hash function described in RFC2104. The result(/"response") is then stored in the clipboard again. 5) in a login form, myTrusted.site.org asks for user-id and response (not password!) and the user pastes the clipboard value into the response field and fills in the user-id. 6) The myTrusted.site.org server receives the two values and i) calculates the "identifier" independently by its own view on the handshake it was involved in ii) retrieves the password from the secure user credential store and calculates the HMAC response if it matches, there was no MITM, if it doesn't match the user most likely entered the response into a MITM (SSL proxy) and the server better aborts the session. passwordsafe development (as per the above URL) has indicated to be interested in providing a prototype for this. We would take care of providing the server-side part for it. Would Firefox participate as well? ------- P.S.: As soon as the refereeing process is over, we'll be able to provide two detailed papers on this approach including a way to authenticate the server back to the user and many more variants of the overall MITM protection issue, some of which might not be contributed to the open source. Reproducible: Always see also Bug 285361 - also, I guess this is a lot simpler than what is discussed in Bug 268835</description>

(See #303192 for another thread on this, I'm sure there are many.) Some users will never want to use the accesskey= functionality, preferring instead to use the browser's access keys. They should have a way to disable accesskey= handling for all pages. I'd envision a Tools-&gt;Options setting, but it would be fine if I had to manually edit a conf file somewhere to disable this. For an example of why this functionality would be useful, open any Wikipedia article (for instance http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) and then try to close the tab (Alt-F C) or print the page (Alt-F P) from the keyboard. The fact that keyboard accelerators work differently on different pages is incredibly confusing behavior. My apologies if this is a dupe, I couldn't find anything like it in the search.

The main reason I believe this will be beneficial: - If you take a look on Mozillazine, or any Firefox messageboard or newsgroup, one of the most common instructions given by someone offering tech support to a user in need is "go to your Profile folder and...." which then usually requires the addition of: "You can find your Profile by going to ........." - where they either write out the long: c:\documents and settings\[WindowsAccountName]\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\[ProfileName]\ .. or give a link to the mozilla.org support page that shows how to locate ones profile. Of course, they could just put %AppData%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles but that usually requires a "copy the above line, right-click on Start, choose, Explore and then paste it in the address bar (you do have that turned on right?)"... Instructing a user to simply click the link in their Start Menu Firefox folder would be much easier! Reproducible: Always (While we're at it, putting a shortcut called 'Firefox Profiles Directory' in the program files install directory would also be beneficial).</description>

That request was rejected, but I suspect the original poster just didn't describe it very well. I believe he was referring to the standard Windows "collapsing menu" widget, where menu items that haven't been used for a time are removed from the menu, with a "double arrow" symbol indicating how to expand the menu back to full size. The rationale for rejecting it was that it would be confusing. However, this behaviour is standard across many Windows-based applications (including IE), and is genuinely useful. Users are also used to this behaviour (on Windows, at least). Of course, users can always just manually organise their bookmarks into folders, but this gives an automatic and easy way of improving the useability of the bookmarks menu.

This then will open a new tab with the selected word/phrase as the keyword for the amazon-search he created earlier. Or if he has a smart keyword for a search at imdb.com, he can select an actors name when he comes across it, right click, choose "Smart Keywords" -&gt; "IMDB" from the context menu and this will perform a smart search with the selected word/phrase on imdb.com Reproducible: Always</description>

For instance that when i was reading yahoo mail and do cntrl-n, i actual purpose of opening a new window was not to open a browser window but to check another mail in the same page This works fine in Internet explorer. And possibly could be taken as an enhancement in firefox</description>

      <title>"Reload" a page without resubmitting POSTDATA (load the same URL using GET)</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5 Some pages (blogs) allow to submit a comment and keep the same URL, such as the above URL. When I want to reload the page, Firefox says: "The page you are trying to view contains POSTDATA. If you resend the data, any action the form carried out (such as a search or online purchase) will be repeated. To resend the data, click OK. Otherwise, click Cancel." But I just want to reload the page without resubmitting anything, and neither OK nor Cancel allows to do that. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open a webpage having the described system. 2. Do a form submission. 3. Click on Reload. Actual Results: Firefox opens a box saying "The page you are trying to view contains POSTDATA. If you resend the data, any action the form carried out (such as a search or online purchase) will be repeated. To resend the data, click OK. Otherwise, click Cancel." and having two buttons OK and Cancel. Expected Results: The box should have a third button to reload the page without doing any form submission. As a workaround, I can copy the URL, paste it in a new tab and close the old tab.</description>

It doesn't have any cookies when created. It can store cookies just like the browser does it now. But it's virtual, it's never written to disk. So it's completely separate from the real cookies. It's not too important, just a thought, it would be cool. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce:</description>

When i am done with one activity (like doing some research on lots of sites), I often have one last tab I don't want to close because I still need it, usually because I filled in forms in it. I'd like to reduce the clutter on my desktop by moving isolated tabs in single windows to another window. it sould be nice to have it for 2.0 for instance.</description>

Like - Firefox crashes and all things you write is lost - You might forgot something unsubmitted on a tab and accidentally close Firefox - Site you working on collapses, and you lost data etc. I'm sure one of this happened to all of us at least one time, and some of us have developed a habit of copying and pasting long textarea entries to clipboard or somewhere else. I guess we need a solution here. Firefox can save textarea data periodically and automatically , and erases it after a successfull submit, therefore if firefox crashes before submitting, Firefox can provide lost data after reopening and going back to site. I hope this is not a dupe. (Bug 217837 is different I guess) Reproducible: Always</description>

      <title>Live Bookmarks should include a direct link to the site home-page</title>
      <description>Live Bookmarks should include a direct link to the site home-page Live Bookmarks are great to see what's updated on a site/service. However, I often find myself opening a live bookmark, clicking on an arbitrary feed item, and them going from that page to the site home page. Of course, I could also setup a "normal" bookmark for the site in addition to the Live Bookmark, then I have to have two bookmarks for each site. I would suggest another special menu item at the bottom (top?) of the Live Bookmark menu with a link to the site home page. See the attached super-rough mock-up: http://actsofvolition.com/images/screenshots/firefox/live-bookmarks-request.png It seems that the home page is provided in all RSS/Atom feeds either as: &lt;link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="http://www.domain.com/dir/" /&gt; or simply: &lt;link&gt;http://www.domain.com/dir/&lt;/link&gt;</description>

      <description>Build data collection service to gather browser metrics. It would be nice if we had a way to learn more about how users use our browser. Often times, we end up making guesses about usage patterns or typical system constraints. It'd be great if we had a way to collect data from live instances of Firefox and analyze that to improve the product. Some requirements: 1) This service must be *disabled by default* in release builds. Users should be given the choice to enable this feature "to help make Firefox better" or something along those lines. 2) It should be easy for components to add data items to the set being collected. 3) Upload data to a collection server periodically and flush local copy. 4) Make data available server-side for easy analysis.</description>

      <title>Programatically clear HTTP Authentication Cache</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322) Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; pt-BR; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5 I'm a website developer and I'm using http-authentication on my site. The first time when a user access my page he/she is asked for username and password through browser authentication box. After user leaves the site (using a logoff page), if he/she doesn't close the browser window or manually clears the authentication cache, if he/she returns to site again, the authentication box isn't displayed, because the username and password are stored on browser cache. Working with Internet Explorer, I use the javascript code document.execCommand("ClearAuthenticationCache") on the logoff page and when the user comes back to site, a new authentication box is displayed, since authentication information was cleared from cache. I was looking for a way to make the same thing on Firefox because I want to make it compatible with FF, too. After a long search and various posts on messages boards of Mozillazine, some users told me to create a request in Bugzilla, because there´s no currently way to programatically clears cache of HTTP Authentication in FF, like IE does with the ClearAuthenticationCache command. I think this missing feature makes user information vulnerable. On public computers, if a user forgets to close browser window or clear the authentication cache manually, other users that use the same computer can acess the site using previous credentials entered, since the browser will not ask for a username and password again. I think this bug isn't duplicated because I'm asking for a way to perform this task (clear authentication cache) programatically, using javascript or something like it to clear authentication cache without user intervention. On the site posted to reproduce problem (http://gemal.dk/browserspy/password-works.html) use Username: test Password: test. See the link "flush all credentials" on the page. Use IE to see what I need to do with FF too. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Acess http://gemal.dk/browserspy/password-works.html using IE 2. Username: test Password: test 3. Refresh the page to ensure that you are authenticated 4. Click the link "flush all credentials" 5. Refresh the page and IE will ask for username and password again 6. I need to make the same thing with FF Actual Results: FF doesn't display authentication box on sites that I type my username and password if I manually clear the authentication cache. Expected Results: FF must have a javascript method to clear authentication cache of user programatically.</description>

For example, with use_document_fonts=1, this html produces three identical paragraphs: &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;p style="font-size: 24; font-family: serif"&gt;hello world&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="font-size: 24; font-family: sans-serif"&gt;hello world&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="font-size: 24; font-family: monospace"&gt;hello world&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; I'd like to give page authors the freedom to specify a "general font-family" (one of: serif, sans-serif, monospace, fantasy, cursive (per http://blooberry.com/indexdot/css/properties/font/fontfamily.htm)) without allowing them to specify a specific font (Arial, Courier, Garamond, etc). If possibly, a page that specified Courier would, when specific font selection is disabled, fall back to the correct general font family. However, the browser will not always have enough information to make this choice. This RFE could be implemented as a new preference, perhaps "use_document_font_families", or as a new integer value for use_document_fonts. Reproducible: Always</description>

Disabling yimg.com then intereferes with Yahoo email functionality (e.g. cannot save email to folders) until yimg.com is temporarily re-enabled - and this restarts the Unresponsive Script: Warning error box until yimg.com is disabled again. This did not happen on earlier versions of Firefox - however when I tried to revert to previous version to avoid the problem the Unresponsive Script: Warning box still came up. NoScript is a work-around, not a cure, since it's necessary to permit yimg.com any time I want to save a Yahoo email. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Log on to My Yahoo http://my.yahoo.com/index.html 2.

      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; rv:1.8) Gecko/20060124 Firefox/1.5 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; rv:1.8) Gecko/20060124 Firefox/1.5 When you select the option to force "_blank" targets to open in a new page, then the new tab ends up after the last open tab. This is very annoying when you have many open tabs. The option that forces new pages to new tabs is a killer feature, fixing this problem would make it just wonderful. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. open many pages in different tabs, say 6 tabs. 2. go back to tab number 1, i.e. the leftmost one. 3. in that page, click on a link that opens a new page. -&gt; a new tab opens, at position 7. Tab 7 gets the focus. 4. you quickly look at this page, then you close it and you usually want to go back to the parent page. So you close tab 7. 5. Tab 6 gets the focus. Then you have to look at all your tabs to find where you started from. Expected Results: The new tab should be created right after (or before) the parent's tab: when you close it you should end directly in the parent page. On situation where the annyoance of this behaviour is evident is when reading forums. Many people go through the forum's index and ctrl-clik on all the threads with an interesting title, so they end up with lots of new tabs. These tabs often have the same title, so it's not easy nor fast to decide what tab contains which post. Then they start reading the posts they opened, these posts often contains links (that are related to the post) that open in a new page. The problem is that you usually look quickly at these external links, but soon you want to get back to the thread. Unfortunately getting back to the thread you were reading is quite a pain as you have to look at almost all the open tabs.</description>

      <title>Single-sign-on password management system</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; rv:1.8) Gecko/20060109 Firefox/1.5 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; rv:1.8) Gecko/20060109 Firefox/1.5 Right now the existing password management is specific for the mozilla platform. Kde has is Wallet, Opera has its own password management, and many other projects reinvent the wheel looking at their own belly-buttons. It is a waste of resources ((wo)man-hours of coding), and an additional harassment of the users, because the different systems are incompatible. In other words, the contents do not propagate from one system to the other one. Thus, if I set my bugzilla password on Firefox, Konqueror does not know anything about it. Some people won't bother that much, because they use only one browser. KDE has its KWallet system, which is a step in the right direction. looks like it will finally become really a 'single sign on' system on KDE 4 (right now it asks for a password just after logon, so the user has to input a password twice). I think that with enough goodwill a STANDARD system for an encrypted password wallet can be designed, implemented and adopted by the interested parties, like: KDE GNOME Mozilla Opera (competition is good, and cooperation where it matters is even better) etc. I think that it would be better if Mozilla.org is not 'The Manager' of the project. I think Freedesktop.org is the shrine of current 'Open Source Desktop Environment Standards', and as such should coordinate the effort, and Mozilla.org and the others would work with it to design a system useable by all. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Set up password for some site with password management enabled 2. open any other browser 3. no password there Actual Results: Each browser has its own password management system Expected Results: When i set up a password for some place, it should be stored in a browser-agnostic way I have filed a bug on freedesktop.org on this subject some time ago. https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4513</description>

      <title>[security] Insecure defaults for menu Tools =&gt; Options =&gt; [privacy] tab</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5 In today's world security satrts with every application installed. Thefore it is essential that each one of them provides *secure* defaults, which may not necessarily be "convenient". Most of the people do not "tweak" the settings, they just install the software and run it, so any "insecurity" in default application doesn't get tightened. Firefox in this respect ships with settings that "may be convenient", but which are unfortunately insecure in present settings. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Select "tools" menu 2. Select "Options" 3. Select "Privacy" tab Under tabs "Saved forms, Passowrds, Download history, Cache" the default settings are insecure. Actual Results: PÅrivate data is left lying around after shutting dows firefox in its default installation state. Expected Results: No private inforamtion is saved by default. Under the "privacy" topic (Menu Tools =&gt; Settings), the following settings in mentioned tabs (below) would better enhance privacy in default installation. The "[ ]" means leaving the item unchecked, and "[x]" as checked. saved forms : [ ] Save information I enter in forms .... Passwords : [ ] remember passwords Download history: [When firefox exits] Cache : button "Settings" =&gt; [x] Clear data when closing firefox</description>

      <title>Tab bar breaks UI guidelines - suggest implementing sidebar</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-GB; rv:1.8) Gecko/20060130 Ubuntu/1.5.dfsg-4ubuntu6 Firefox/1.5 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-GB; rv:1.8) Gecko/20060130 Ubuntu/1.5.dfsg-4ubuntu6 Firefox/1.5 The tab bar currently breaks all the UI guidelines by being horizontal. Users are prone to opening large numbers of tabs (probably browsing porn, but that's users for you) and the horizontal tab bar is not up to this - tabs tend to shrink and become unreadable, and disappear off the righthand side of the bar behind the close button and beyond. I suggest that an option be added for the tab bar be placed on the lefthand or righthand side of the screen in a similar way to the Tab Sidebar extension (http://users.blueprintit.co.uk/~dave/web/firefox/TabSidebar/) without the preview and without being integrated with the sidebar. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open Firefox. 2. Open thirty or so tabs with whatever website you like in them. Actual Results: Tab bar is horizontal across the top of the screen. Tabs become obscured due to lack of screen real-estate. Expected Results: Tab bar is vertical on the lefthand or righthand side of the screen. Tabs are not obscured because the user can easily scroll through the list using the mouse wheel or scrollbar. Relevant quotes from UI guidelines: Windows: "By default, a tab [bar] displays only one row of tabs. Although the control supports multiple rows or scrolling a single row of tabs, avoid these options because they add complexity to the interface and make it harder for the user to read and access a particular tab." Mac OS X: "However, if you have too many tabs to fit into a window properly you should instead use a pop-up menu to change the contents of a group box." GNOME: "Do not put too many [tabs] in the same [window]. If you cannot see all the tabs without scrolling or splitting them into multiple rows, you are probably using too many and should use a list...instead." KDE: "Especially when it is expected that the list of tabs in one window becomes very high, use a sidebar...rather than a [tab bar]."</description>

      <title>start local-apps from url-bar</title>
      <description>Hey. I'm trying to create an local "intranet"-page for my das notebook to start all the browser-links and maybee all apps he have links to on his (overfull) desktop. IE have an nice feature to start local apps from the url-bar of with only typeing the full path to the exe. If I try this on Firefox (trunk and 1.5.01) I only get the option to download the (local) file. IMHO there should be an way to start (local) exe-files from within Fx directly. Can somebody do this? (Maybee reactivat the gred-out alternetive download-option-box and put an "start exe" in it.) Thx in advance.</description>

      <title>local bookmarks (toolbar/sidebar) should use system-icons or have the ability to spec an icon for each</title>
      <description>Hey. If I set an bookmark to an local file (e.g. pdf) I think (IMHO) the bookmark should have the (windows-)system-icon of the file. TabEx seems to have an function to set an bookmark-icon for each bookmark, but to my sorrow it seems not to work with exe-files. (I seems it cant get an icon out of an exe-file.) Have the ability to spec an icon for each link (local or not - if the url haven't one) will be the better solution IMHO. Hope this can somebody implement. Thx in advance.</description>

      <title>if browsing local system-folder, there should be an switch so that files can have system-icons</title>
      <description>Hey. I try to create my dad an local-"intranet" for his notebook. To bring most funcionalty to Firefox and making some things easyer for him, I want to let em browse those folders with pdf-files he have links on his desktop with Fx. (So he doesn't need to use this annoying explorer-windows and cant make things wrong and also have an smarter way to jump on level up.) For this solution it would be nice to have an (pref.js-)switch to use windows-system-icons on (local-)folders. For an long-term-solution (IMHO) I think it also will be easyer for newbees to have system-icons on ftp-dirs as they havent fav-icons and with an standard installation of windows the registered file-extensions are cut-off, so the maybee doesnt know what file-extension stands for what. (But maybee the can see on the icons what file is for what.)</description>

It would be useful if the date of the article was also cached. My use case is for an RSS extension, which needs to compare a last viewed state against the current livemark state. For performance reasons I store an xml file with the most recent article's url (I sort the articles by date first) for each feed. However, there is currently no way for me to query a livemark to find its most recent article, because the children are listed in the order they are found in the feed (I believe). If the children had a date property, I could efficiently resolve the state correctly. Reproducible: Always</description>

      <title>Fix lots of problems:  Put each document in its own, independent process</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Konqueror/3.4; Linux) KHTML/3.4.1 (like Gecko) Build Identifier: This is a catch-all suggestion that would solve numerous problems that I encounter. I have no idea how much effort this would require, but the usability boost would be worth the effort. My suggestion is to spawn a separate PROCESS (not thread) for each document (window/tab). Here are some reasons: Firefox is memory-hungry. When doing the obligatory search before filing this report, I found a very nice discussion on this. Firefox leaks memory and doesn't make efficient use of non-leaked memory. The problem comes when the system starts thrashing because FF's memory goes to swap. When this happens, my instinct is to start closing tabs and bookmarking pages I want to save, but I can never do this, because FF causes massive thrashing, and always inevitably hangs up. Closing documents doesn't free any memory back to the system, so the thrashing continues. If documents had their own address spaces, closing tabs and windows WOULD free memory, giving me a chance to make the bookmarks. Firefox has a tendency to freeze up. There are various circumstances where this happens. Some web pages use Javascript that gets into an infinite loop, but FF doesn't realize it and just hangs. When FF causes thrashing, it's usually a prelude to a crash. (It occurs to me now that that sudden onset of thrashing may be caused by a sudden runaway allocation of memory, and freeing memory wouldn't help. It's going to crash anyway.) It would be great if I could kill just the one hanging process and leave the rest running. Firefox has a tendency to crash. Since you don't have a crash-recovery system, it would at least be nice if only the one document would close, rather than taking everything with it. A runaway isolated process can't take down the whole browser. I've written my share of bugs that clobber memory I don't own. With all documents in one address space, some weird page that hits a browser bug and sends it stomping on every document open would take everything down, rather than just the one document. Security. A buffer overflow or other information leak cannot cause sensitive data in one document to be available to another. Particular in the case of an exploit, it can't get to the contents of other windows, because the IPC involved in moving data between documents would add complexity harder to exploit. Even when functioning properly, closing a tab doesn't return memory to the system. That's usually not a problem, but with FF being so memory-hungry, that really IS a problem. With separate processes for each document, closing a document would shut down the entire process, freeing all the memory. Plus, if the document hung, the shell could just kill the process. With multiple processes, one hanging process won't make other documents unusable. As it is, one hanging javascript program causes every tab of every window to completely freeze up. If the shell (container for windows and some UI stuff) crashes, it would be nice to locate the document processes and reconnect. The biggest drawback is that there's no way to forcibly kill all processes, unless you provide a tool to do it. Also, the shell should be as minimal as possible, hoisting as much work as possible onto the worker processes so as to minimize the impact (or chances) of a shell crash. I know that many of you are thinking that you should just fix the memory leaks and crashes. That's noble, but it's as futile as Microsoft trying to fix all their buffer overflows. The rate of feature additions is greater than the rate of bug fixing. You can never fix all the problems, so all you can do is improve the robustness of the system so that when problems DO happen, they aren't so catastrophic. Fail-safes. I don't recall if FF has crash-recovery, but it it doesn't, it should. But with separate processes, you don't even hardly need crash recovery, because you'll never have the whole browser crash. Thank you for taking the time to read my rant. Reproducible: Always</description>

For Example: 1. It gives a trust rating of a page out of 10, it shades red for the amount it find's risky. If the site has a 5 Risk rating the site is shaded red halfway. 2. Tells you how old the site or how long the site has been around. 3. Gives you the ranking of the website of every URL in it's database (not 100% accurate but you get the idea). It's around 80% accurate. 4. Shows the flag of the nation where the site is hosted and the nations name beside it. 5. Names the server where the site is hosted. These are just defenses to aviod unknown phishing sites, it blocks URLS that Netcraft Confirms as a phishing site. Not just this it prevents various other attacks similar to phishing attacks. Netcraft Toolbar is simply the best at blocking phishing sites (tried Google Safe Browsing and the new IE7 Beta 2). Firefox 2.0 should implement something similar to this. Phishing sites URLS should also be in red (just like Yellow is for Secure). This is might be too much, be we must evolve along with the world.

The old Fonts were designed with printing in mind, the new ones are made for displaying them I'm not sure if the Fonts are bundled with Windows or with any other app (Office?) but Mozilla should evaulate using those fonts as default Fonts. IMO they are quite better readable. (this also applies for Thunderbird) Reproducible: Always</description>

The tree view is very useful if you want to drop the bookmark into a folder, which is needed for pretty much every bookmark once you have a lot of them. You can then close the dialog with the tree view still showing. However, the next time you add a bookmark, you have to re-click the dialog to bring back the tree view. That's an unnecessary click; the tree view should default to whatever state you left it in, just like the browser window size does. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Hit ctrl-d to add a bookmark 2. Click triangle icon to show tree view. Add bookmark. Close dialog 3. Hit ctrl-d to add another bookmark Actual Results: dialog comes up again with tree view closed Expected Results: dialog should come up with tree view already opened, if you left it that way last time</description>

      <description>- add a post-date annotation for every entry in a feed folder - set the expiry of this any any other related annotations to no more than the lifetime of the item (i.e. before the next livemark refresh) - prevents the annotation table from bloating - implement a sortingAnnotation property on nsINavHistoryQueryOptions, and add a SORT_BY_ANNOTATION_DESCENDING/ASCENDING to the set of sortingMode options, that can sort the result set based on annotation content. - finish the attached prototype patch, which implements a special tree view for subscriptions so that unread items can be displayed etc.</description>

I might have another machine with IE on it, or want to be able to convert a friend who uses IE. I'm assuming that it *can* import from IE. If not, that's a bigger problem. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Find machine without IE, or delete all IE user data 2. Launch Firefox and select File:Import... Actual Results: Only Safari is shown as an import choice. Expected Results: Any available importers should be shown. If no data for them was found, they should be greyed-out (disabled). This is the 20060128 Places build.

Maybee somebody can code an selecton-menu to select which headers of which sidebar will be shown in the sidebar to. So users can select those two or three sidebars the use the most.

This is the option I'm talking about: user_pref("browser.cache.memory.capacity", SIZE); Thanks in advance, and if there's a particular reason for that option not being in the menu please tell me.

      <title>Send RSS feeds to Thunderbird from within Firefox</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.8.0.1) Gecko/20060111 Firefox/1.5.0.1 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.8.0.1) Gecko/20060111 Firefox/1.5.0.1 This is a request for an enhancement. I love the way that Firefox discovers RSS/Atom feeds, but I'm not too crazy about the way it actually displays them. I love the way that Thunderbird displays RSS feeds -- as messages in a mail folder, but I'm not too crazy about the way it discovers them (you have to manually add feeds to Thunderbird through a somewhat clunky interface). I'd love to have the best of both worlds: When Firefox discovs RSS/Atom feed and you click on the feed icon in the URL bar (or when you click on an RSS/Atom feed link in a web page), it should send a "command" (for lack of a better word -- I'm not a programmer!) to Thunderbird to add that RSS feed to Thunderbird's RSS feed reader, much in the same way that clicking on a "mailto:" link opens up a mail composition window in Thunderbird. Of course, this should be an *option*, so that people who don't want this behavior can have their RSS feeds served up completely by Firefox. Reproducible: Always</description>

The current options are insufficient: I don't want a new window for each new link; I don't want a new tab in a "random" window; I don't want to lose any of my existing open pages. Clearly, if the dedicated window does not already exist it should be created. This behaviour is very similar to that for IE (with the addition of making use of the tab functionality in Firefox). Given the current set of options, this functionality should be absolutely trivial to implement and arguably should probably be the default option for new installations.

A lot of extensions store "private" data, and have no way to "fully" integrate with Sanitize. Currently there is no unified interface to this functionality. nsIBrowserGlue (implemented in components/nsBrowserGlue.js) provides the UI-less functionality (by interanlly loading sanitize.js as a subscript). The UI on the other hand directly grabs sanitize.js. Methods allowing the addition of items are not provided. I could imagine an implementation like this: All is done in a single component (eg. ns(I)BrowserGlue). The UI uses this component too. Extensions may provide simple components (based on a simple interface) to add themselves. This might be done eg. by using a category (categorymanager) where these components add themselves upon registration. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce:</description>

      <title>Search for address/URL/URI, not only title, in history</title>

Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open history 2. Search for Mozilla 3. This page (&lt;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Firefox&gt;) isn't found because its title is 'Enter a bug'. Actual Results: It is unnecessary difficult to find pages in the history. Expected Results: This page isn't found I want some options when I search in the history, typically: 1. Search page titles 2. Search page addresses 3. Search page domains 4. Search page paths, i.e., the 'tail' after the protocol type and FQDN (for this page that would be 'enter_bug.cgi?product=Firefox') These options should be combinable, probably by using either check boxes (like the one on the Enter bug page you can check if it is security problem) or a menu where you can check multiple items simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Thread history to ease navigation of previously visited sites</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8.0.1) Gecko/20060111 Firefox/1.5.0.1 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8.0.1) Gecko/20060111 Firefox/1.5.0.1 Thread history to ease navigation of previously visited sites. Have a look at &lt;http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/macwarriors/projects/trailblazer/&gt;. Basically, the point is that when navigating the history it is sometimes useful to know that you started on page A, clicked links on A that lead to B and C. On B you found link D, E and F. C on the other hand was a cul-de-sac. Conceptually this is very similar to how you thread e-mails on mailing lists. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: Actual Results: It is unnecessary difficult to find pages in the history. Expected Results: A history that looked like this: Root site --&gt; A | +-&gt; B +-&gt; C | + --&gt; D</description>

      <title>Option for mailto: links to go to a web based e-mail client (webmail service)</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.12) Gecko/20050915 Firefox/1.0.7 (ax) Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.12) Gecko/20050915 Firefox/1.0.7 (ax) Firefox currently supports a wide number of stand alone e-mail applications (including it's own Thunderbird client), when an e-mail link is clicked on in Firefox. To the best of my knowledge it still does not support web based e-mail clients such as g-mail in this fashion. The idea is that if one prefers to use a web based e-mail account, they should have the option to configure firefox to log into that web based e-mail account and open a compose new message window. I understand this may require some colaboration with the popular web based e-mail services such as gmail and aim mail, but I think it would be worth the benifit. Reproducible: Always</description>

      <title>Manual proxy configuration does not reject URLs entered (as hostnames)</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; Avalon 6.0.5070; WinFX RunTime 3.0.50727) Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.1) Gecko/20060111 Firefox/1.5.0.1 In trying to set up Firefox, I copied my proxy settings from Internet Explorer. IE uses this format: http://192.168.1.1. Firefox uses 192.168.0.1. No validation is performed - Firefox accepts the erroneous input data and then fails to connect. This isn't helped by there being no examples of manual proxy configuration in the Help documentation or on the website. Come on guys, if you want to get people to switch from IE, either do things the same way or make it obvious you're doing it differently. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open Options 2. Click on Connection Settings 3. Enter http://&lt;your-proxy-ip-address 4. Try to access an Internet web site. Actual Results: You get the Firefox Try Again page. Expected Results: Displayed a page from the web site.</description>

      <title>menu item for tab navigation</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X; en) AppleWebKit/417.9 (KHTML, like Gecko) Safari/417.8 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8.0.1) Gecko/20060111 Firefox/1.5.0.1 Safari and Camino have an item in the Window menu for selecting the next and previous tab. On first inspection, this doesn't seem that useful--it's much easier just to click the tab. However, a menu item is the single best place to document the keyboard shortcut for an action. On OS X, a menu item also provides a handle for the standard keyboard shortcut mechanism (System Preferences &gt; Keyboard &amp; Mouse &gt; Keyboard Shortcuts). Safari users who occasionally dabble in Firefox would appreciate the ability to remap the tab navigation keys without digging into .js or .xml files. (Firefox does not always seem to honor keyboard shortcuts, but that's an issue for another report.) Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Select Window menu 2. Look for tab navigation items Actual Results: No tab navigation items found. Expected Results: Find tab navigation items; e.g., Select Next Tab, Select Previous Tab. The normal behavior is that a user-defined shortcut replaces the default. However, OS X does not let you map actions to PgUp and PgDn. If this enhancement request is accepted, I guess Firefox should continue to recognize Cmd-PgUp and Cmd-PgDn in addition to the user-defined shortcut. Indeed, I don't know that Firefox would have any way of knowing that the user had defined a new shortcut.</description>

      <title>Empty frame profile to make Desktop applications in xul.</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051224 Debian/1.5.dfsg-3 Firefox/1.5 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051224 Debian/1.5.dfsg-3 Firefox/1.5 This is not a bug, but a missing feature. I hope I don't upset you. Mozilla needs a way to run XUL applications, as desktop applications. mozilla -P empty wordprocessor.xul where an empty frame would load with the xul application in the window. It is very difficult to make applications on Linux when you consider all the dependicies needed. For example, python with gtk, is a poor choice since each user would have to install a gtk to run a program. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. mozilla -P user.js wordprocessor.xul 2. 3. Actual Results: user.js is a attempt to make an empty shell. User is given option to use profile. mozilla writes a lot of config files to directory and changes prefs.js. The window opens up changed, but menu bars still exist. The application looks as if it was opened in a web browser. If the browser is already open, the xul is placed in a tab. Expected Results: An empty frame with the xul application running. The application should look like any desktop application. The command should open up a new independent frame of Mozilla. firefox -P empty wordprocessor.xul, should open a window with empty frame and wordprocesser.xul running in the window.</description>

      <title>Some cookie use cases that should be addressed.</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.1) Gecko/20060111 Firefox/1.5.0.1 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.1) Gecko/20060111 Firefox/1.5.0.1 These things really bug me and pop up every couple of weeks. (Note: I've got my cookie settings on "Allow" and "Ask every time") Scenario 1: I have denied a site to set cookies in the past because I was "just browsing". Later that year, I decide I want to create an account and log in. So I fill out the form, hit submit and I get an error from the website saying "please allow cookies". So I look at the url in the address bar, then go to Tools-&gt;Options-&gt;Privacy-&gt;Cookies-&gt;Exceptions and scan that list visually for the domain name, and delete that "Block" record. I go back to the website, fill in the form again, and it works. Scenario 2: Just like Scenario 1, except that the web site has used some other domain to store the cookie. Sometimes this is easy to deduce, and I can find it in the Exceptions list (they left out the www, for example), but sometimes it can't be figured out, so I have to clear the ENTIRE exceptions list. Which means all that work I've done declaring which sites should be trusted and which sites shouldn't will have to be repeated. Suggestion: at the bare minimum, the Exceptions list should be searchable - especially nice would be if when you start typing into that "Address of website" text entry, it grepped the list underneath so that only sites containing the entered text were shown -- ie, i type "google" and it only shows the www.google.com, groups.google.com, and maps.google.com cookies. Bigger suggestion: Do an analysis of what the use cases are for allowing &amp; blocking cookies, and then hide all occurrences of the word "cookie" from the user. The only privacy concern regarding cookies that I know of is the fear that a site will track where I visit across domains (ie, a doubleclick.com cookie that can see me across sites because there's a banner on each site's page, letting doubleclick.com know that after i visited my personal blog identifying me as a congressman, i next went to suicidegirls). So maybe the popup dialog should say something like "Doubleclick.com wants to remember that you visited www.congressblog.com. Is this ok? (Allow) (Deny)" Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce:</description>

I'm referring to the initial launch of the application. Of course, a smaller faster browser is one answer. In the mean time - how about a speed launch / preloader? Adobe does this with Acrobat Reader. Their program takes to long to load, so I have the speedlaunch in my startup folder and know it feels faster loading adobe acrobat, as some of it is already loaded. Now you can compete with IE in terms of initial load time of the application, because FireFox will be partially preloaded as well! I think you should build this, default it to on; but allow anyone to remove the speed launch from startup. Has this been proposed? What do you think? Sincerely, Damien Stevens Utopia Net Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: Actual Results: It loads slowly the first time. Expected Results: Faster load time! See what Adobe has done with Acrobat Reader.</description>

However, the vast majority of problems with Firefox are based on having a corrupted or misconfigured profile. The uninstall program should have an option that asks the user if he wants to remove all profiles (default should be no) with a clear explanation saying what it does, like "Do you want to also remove your profiles (installed themes, extensions, settings, cookies and history)?" This would ease support issues greatly. Reproducible: Always</description>

      <title>New menu item and toolbar button to temporarily override page's fonts and colors</title>
      <description>This came out of a discussion with mconnor and others about bug 277966. The idea is to have a way to temporarily toggle the "Allow pages to choose their own fonts" and "Allow pages to choose their own colors" for a specific tab, without digging through 2 layers of options dialogs and without changing it globally and permanently. Such a feature could live in the View/Text Size menu (possibly renamed View/Text Style) and would have the same persistence as the Increase/Decrease Text Size menu items, i.e. it would stay in effect for that particular tab as long as the tab was open, but it would not be written to disk. Ideally, the change would be immediate and would not require a page refresh, but I have no idea if that's realistic.</description>

      <description>The bootstrap loader we're using is kind of old; it was cloned from one that we built when we were still figuring out how it should work.

      <title>check for performance impact</title>
      <description>Are we impacting page load time? One way we could check this is by modifying the loggifyer code (see debug.js) to automatically profile. We can see how much time we're taking in each function we call on the critical path (progresslistener, etc). This is a cool task in and of itself. The loggifyer could easily be augmented to do very interesting profiling stuff.</description>

      <title>clean up wireformat utils</title>
      <description>The code in wireformat.js could use some cleanup. It's hard to verify by inspection that is correct, and it's rather hard to unittest because of its asynchronous nature. We should refactor this code so that it's cleaner. See wireformat.js for more ideas/details.</description>

      <title>maybe move file reading earlier in startup phase</title>
      <description>Turns out we can read the profile directory much earlier than on profileafterchange. Darin says use "ProfDS" instead of "ProfD" to read the profile directory at xpcom-startup (or anytime really). So we can potentially move profile directory-dependant code earlier. Non-esential, but good to know.</description>

      <title>clean up problem queue interface</title>
      <description>The problem queue as its used in browser-view.js is not abstracted. It should be; the code as it is is hard to verify by inspection. We should have a Queue object that supports the operations we require (peek, shift, push, remove arbitrary element).</description>

      <title>a real javascript unittest framework</title>
      <description>Right now we're doing something really, really cheesey for unittests: defining them in functions at the end of our source files and then calling these functions explicitly when we're in debug mode. Blech. We need a real framework, one that: - can print the source of the test that failed - has a useful library of CHECK methods - can provide XUL or HTML docs to test functions - (maybe) can read source files - etc Lots of work has been done on unittesting; let's learn from what's out there.</description>

      <title>(maybe) ditch the stack-and-canvas based dimming on some platforms?</title>
      <description>Right now the way we achieve dimming out the content area and showing the warning is rather kludgey. The main limitation is that you can't place semi-transparent areas over the browser content area -- it doesn't work, they just show up as grey. There are two implications for us. First, that we can't just overlay a semi-transparent png on the content area to dim it. Second, that the "tail" of the warning message would look weird if positioned over the content area (the image only fills part of the box; the rest would look grey). Hence, our abomination of a technique to get things to work out (see phishing-afterload-displayer.js and safebrowsing-overlay.xul). However, I'm told that some recent changes might make this possible on some platforms (see depends on bug). Let's investigate whether we can't switch to something more sane (semi-transparent png to dim and transparent background on the tail) on the platforms that support it. At the very least, this can change in FFox 3.</description>

Reproducible: Always Actual Results: i click the bookmark, some page opens. if that REALLY is the page i bookmarked weeks ago... who know? i would not want to check the cert everytime i visit Expected Results: the browser asks me to verify the cert once and keeps track, that it will not change in the future.</description>

Would be great, when being able to add an option "This is a live bookmark". So you can add a Feed when knowing just the Feed-URL and not the Website referring to it. As the "add live bookmark" is not being shown when viewing a Feed within the browser (visit the Feed-URL), the asked option would be the ONLY way to add this feed without knowing a referer page. BTW. Adding the icon when viewing an RSS Feed in browser would not be bad, too. Reproducible: Always</description>

Using the up or down arrow key would set the scroll speed. At any point during an autoscroll, the up key decrements the downward scroll speed or increments the upward scroll speed. The down key decrements the upward scroll speed and increments the downward scroll speed. Given a long page, this functionality increases manoeuvrability where the arrow keys control the scroll speed better than analog inputs (moving the mouse). Having the left &amp; right arrow keys scroll in the same way would also be useful. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Use the middle-click to being autoscrolling. 2.

      <title>HTTP auth dialog should only be modal for the target tab, but not block the whole window (usability)</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.0.1) Gecko/20060126 SUSE/1.5.0.1-5.1 Firefox/1.5.0.1 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.0.1) Gecko/20060126 SUSE/1.5.0.1-5.1 Firefox/1.5.0.1 When accessing a website which requires HTTP basic authentification, the password prompt is shown as a modal dialog which blocks any other operations on the browser window. This causes bad usability because a user might encounter a HTTP auth prompt for which she does not remember the login information and might want to look it up in parallel in another tab. It would therefore be better to only lock the affected tab while the dialog is shown. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Have at least one tab open 2. open a website which requires HTTP auth in a new tab (e.g. http://www.w3.org/Member/) 3. Attempt to navigate back to the other tab while the auth dialog is shown Actual Results: Normal browser navigation is impossible due to modal auth dialog. Expected Results: The auth dialog blocks only operations to the originating tab until fully processed, but does allow normal operation on the other tabs in the meantime. Just consider the following use case: Some user is unexpectedly confronted with a HTTP auth dialog but knows that she has the login information stored somewhere in her webmail-account. So the natural thing to do would be to open a new tab and search the webmail-account for the login data and possibly copy the hard-to-remember default password from the e-mail over to the HTTP auth dialog. But this isn't possible because everything's locked. So the user has to click cancel in the dialog, which brings her to the auth error page in this tab, then open a new tab and do the research, then come back to the auth tab, hit back, click the password-protected link again and then finally login. It would be great if the AUTH dialog sticks to the tab it was coming from and leaves the other ones alone. (Unfortunately, this would IMHO require quite some re-design and coding effort). Back in the days of multiple browser windows this was not really an issue, but nowadays, where tab navigation is pretty much state-of-the-art, I've already seen several people being puzzled by the fact that they can't navigate their tabs when encountering such an AUTH dialog.</description>

This sequence of dialog boxes is clearly labeled to indicate the state of the browser in executing this operation; the one exception (from my perspective) is that it provides no clear indication of when the user is about to commit to the import operation. The second panel “Items to Import” should contain a button labeled “Import Now” to so indicate. As an example of a case when this would be desirable, I wanted to explore this part of Firefox functionality (importing) without actually importing, and couldn't tell when I crossed from choosing settings into committing to the import operation (until after the fact). I would have preferred to cancel prior to committing. Toward this end, I would like to see the “Next &gt;” button in the second panel relabeled as “Import Now”, while preserving all other functionality. This supports the general goal of having the Firefox UI safe to explore by trusting that irreversible actions are clearly labeled as such. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Select File | Import 2. Select anything appropriate to import, then go through the import process to completion.</description>

      <title>Places should include a list of open tabs</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20060320 Firefox/2.0a1 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20060320 Firefox/2.0a1 Hello, I found the Places features very promising. One thing I would find very useful is to simply have a new entry listing the currently open tabs, that is : [ Search ] &lt;hr/&gt; * History * Bookmarks Menu * Bookmarks Toolbar * Current Tabs &lt;=== HERE * Subscriptions I don't know if it should be relative only to the current window or include tabs from all window, but it would be *very* useful to be able to have a list of the open tabs, type two and three characters and then find it. Using Wikipedia, I frequently have more than 30 tabs open to do some maintenance tasks, and it's a nightmare to find the good one in those cases. See the screenshot to understand what I mean. The advantage over the list in the history I'm using here to make my idea clear is that it will not load the chosen page in the current tab, but will open the page I've already opened in the good tab.

      <title>Introduce an easier way to allow sites to cut/copy/paste (possibly a dialog) via scripts</title>

I have a webmail client that utilizes javascript to attach inline HTML files to emails. The only way it can accomplish this by accessing HTML saved to the clipboard. Instead of changing a file to disable this security feature (which is simply NOT a smart thing to do) how about replacing the "unprivileged scripts" dialog (which is useless) with an "allow once" option? Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Copy anything to the clipboard 2. Try to paste it into a field via a java app (I was using Horde webmail) 3. Actual Results: Dialogue box: "Unprivilidged scripts cannot access Cut/Copy/Paste programatically..." Expected Results: Given me an option to allow once, allow always, etc... Similar to how Firefox behaves with popups. Certainly there has to be some better way to handle this than what you reccomend on this page http://www.mozilla.org/editor/midasdemo/securityprefs.html This is the kind of bug that, if not resolved, will eventually make me discard Firefox and switch to another browser.</description>

      <title>Ability to create livemark from right-click on link to feed URI</title>
      <description>In m.feedback, a user requested the ability to right-click on a feed link and create a live bookmark from there. (Might be hard to do without the target page loaded, though.) Here's the original message: Name: George P Boutwel Email: george.boutwell_at_gmail.com Product: Bon Echo Summary: 2.0a1 Feedback Comments: I downloaded and installed firefox 2.0a1, I don't know how I ever lived without the close box on the tabs... That's just awesome, kudos to the develoers. I like the RSS subscription support (sorta - see below). In general I'm able to do the same daily browsing I did with Firefox 1.5.0.1 in Bon Echo without issue. Of course I have trouble with Places, RSS feeds/Live bookmarks (it is alpha though). Some things to look at (ie feedback) (I haven't dug in to see if these are already reported bugs or not): 1) Delete, seems like I wasn't able to delete anything in the Place dialogs. I think trying to delete even at one point threw an assertion error. Sorry I'm not able to duplicate it. If I come acrossed it again, I'll try to get duplicatable steps. 2) RSS feeds/Live Bookmarks don't seem to work for some web-sites like securityfocus.com 3) Having the ability to add an Live Bookmark/RSS feed, from the righ-click on a link would be AWESOME! 4) Import/Export RSS feeds/Live Bookmarks would be good. It's would give me the best way to test a lot of my RSS feeds and how 2.0 will handle them. I'd especially like to see OPML files supported. 6) On RSS Feeds/Live Bookmarks, an property that controls how many articles/entries show in the drop down would be great.. Especialy when you couple that with Open in Tabs. That's I think all I have for the moment. Gerat work and look forward to nightlies with fixes, and any other alphas.

      <title>Add "Show blocked popup(s)" button to popup blocker message bar</title>
      <description>Right now, the UI for the message bar that appears when a popup is blocked is a bit confusing. The interactive features are (1) a close box (simple enough), and (2) a "Properties" button that unexpectedly yields a menu when clicked. The menu has options to always allow popups from the current site, to disable the message bar, to actually edit popup blocker properties. It also (when possible, see bug 264716) has a list of popups that you can click on individually to show. I propose to change the message bar so that it contains two buttons: "Show blocked popup(s)", and "Properties...". The first button has the effect of showing *all* popups that were blocked. (If a power user wants finer-grained control, they can use the popup blocker widget in the status bar.) The Properties... button would more traditionally go to the popup blocker properties dialog. It's true that the "allow popups from this site" menu option is unaccounted-for in this proposed design; we could just leave that functionality to the properties dialog, since it opens pre-populated with the current site, or we could add another button for it to the message bar. I believe this would simplify the interaction model of the popup blocking message bar, at the cost of some visual cleanliness.</description>

      <title>History URL domain blacklisting</title>
      <description>My history list "By last visited" is overloaded with Gmail and my homepage. I see tens and sometimes hundreds of them per day. Sites that I will never revisit again by means of history; I go simply to my inbox to view my mail and I'll never re-read most of them. It is also terribly privacy sensitive to see all your mails displayed in places or in your sidebar. Everyone who looks two seconds over your shoulder or use your browser for a few moments can see your correspondence. A way to prevent that they overcrowd my history list and make places load slowly would be welcome and I think blacklisting of domains would be a good possibility.</description>

      <title>Tab options 'open links from other applications in...' should be removed</title>
      <description>The only safe option to open links from other applications is in a new window. The most recent window may be in a popup window where the navigation controls are not accessible. The new material may overwrite something the user was looking at, with no way for the user to press 'back'. I've also been surprised by what mozilla thinks the most recent window is. When you've got multiple windows open and are switching between them while another application churns in the background, which window content you lose to the new content becomes a lottery. A new tab in the most recent window may be in a popup window where the tab controls are not accessible, so that the tab is not visible. This tab option should be removed from the Options, and default to opening in a new window.</description>

Basically I'd like to extend rss by either a an &lt;item&gt; attribute folder=foo/bar or alternatively a new &lt;folder&gt; element for each &lt;item&gt;. In my example the live bookmark would be listed in [basefolder]/foo/bar/&lt;live_bookmark&gt;. It's getting quite annoying over time having to adapt file:///usr/share/doc/application_foo-&lt;version_changes&gt;/index.html urls manually, while tree-wise agregation would make it possible to let a tool doing the job, providing such a feed. While not directly a web issue, I'm quite sure I'm not the only one, who would appreciate this improved desktop experience, so it would be nice, if you'd consider implementing it.

Only after the user types some words in the basic mode can he use advanced queries. If he doesn't want to use any strings but only other constraints which I don't think is uncommon, there is no way to access Advanced Search directly. It is unfortunate and this use case should be handled better. In addition to that, the (+) button on the far right isn't noticeable enough and it's not clear that it is related to searching as it isn't associated with search field.

      <title>Disabling "Load Images" causes loss of navigation.</title>

They uncheck "Load Images" however, links that are not coded properly don't appear at all. Graphical picture buttons that are hyperlinked do not render. This can force users to load images (and ads) to continue through the site. Could all the text load first, then the text links that show the locations of all the hyperlinks on the page, and THEN the pictures? That way people could load images but as soon as they saw the link they wanted they could "click ahead". Design suggestion: All links on the page should display a text link to the hyperlink before the image loads. After the image loads it could be replaced. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Click Tools-&gt;options-&gt;content 2. Uncheck Load Images 3. Try to navigate through sites that use picture buttons for hyperlinks. Actual Results: Text version of hyperlink does not appear. Nothing appears above the hyperlink but it still there. If you run the cursor over the location, its location appears in the status bar. You can click and goto the site. Expected Results: A text of the hyperlink appears UNTIL the picture is loaded. This is just an alpha web site but it was created with Microsoft's Frontpage which does not code to show the link instead. Many web pages can not be navigated through without loading the images. This must be a way to force people to load the ads as well.</description>

      <title>modifier-clicking url proxy icon (favicon) should duplicate tab, copy tab to new window, save tab, etc. (using middle/ctrl/shift/alt clicks)</title>
      <description>Currently clicking on the back, forward or home buttons with certain modifiers opens the relevant URL in a different way (new tab, window, save, etc.). These special ways of opening URLs would be useful if applied to the current page too, and would provide a means of performing several frequently requested functionalities. Currently: * Clicking the url proxy icon selects all text in the location bar (whether or not any modifiers are used or the middle mouse button was used) * Hovering over the url proxy icon causes the cursor to become a grab hand. I propose the following changes: * Middle/Ctrl-clicking it opens the current page in a new selected tab * Shift-clicking it opens the current page in a new window * Shift+Middle/Ctrl-clicking it opens the current page in a new background tab * Alt-clicking it saves the current page * When hovered it just looks like a bookmarks toolbar item, so it is clear that it can be clicked but also reasonably intuitive that it can be dragged. The cursor would be unchanged, which would actually be more consistent with other UI elements and programs. The code and reasoning for choosing which action (already used by the back, forward and home buttons) is here: http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/browser/base/content/utilityOverlay.js#127 This is a split of bug 263942, after discussing that one with timeless on IRC he suggested that it would make much more sense for the functionality to be added to the url proxy icon instead of the reload button.</description>

I can't speak for others, but for me its a critical usability feature, available in Opera, and if not supported I would probably not find an alternative browser easily usable. Right now I'm using a prefs.js "hack" from Mozilla. But since vertical tabbar is almost at the point of "could nearly be working" now, it makes sense to get it working the rest of the way. Vertical tabbar capability exists in Firefox and is used. It just doesn't work quite properly right now, it has a few issues that horizontal tabbar doesn't, mostly because it's not properly integrated. If it were, then likely other extensions would better support it too. I feel that in view of its usefulness, it should be a tabbar option and not just rely upon what Simon Bünzli (probably accurately) calls a "hack". Simon Bünzli suggests that the JS in the Wiki mostly works due to the Mozilla community, and that this should therefore be filed as an enhancement request. If so, it's a serious one, because for heavy tab users, vertical tabbar can be a very valuable device for efficient browsing, presenting the Firefox user with the maximum number of tabs in one row/column. Thanks. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: n/a - enhancement request Actual Results: n/a - enhancement request</description>

      <description>Currently, the annotation strings used by the live bookmarks service are defined in constants in nsLivemarkService.h.

One of the main problems are Live Bookmarks has limited functionality 1. The unread pages should be in bold (unread in normal text) 2. If the Live Bookmark has a new feed (or update) the button should give out a glow. 3. If mouse is pointed for an x number of time, it should display a summary (if the original XML or Feed page has given a summary) 4. While the Live Bookmark icon is clicked, the button should revert to the linked Feed page with Links to add a Live Bookmark or subsribe to it to Firefox Feed Reader (if you have this planned) 5. Firefox should use the Feed Title as the default name (I think you got this covered) 6. When mouse rolls over the Feed button in the Location bar it should display some sort of behaviour (like glow or something) And maybe an about:config entry to override the Live Bookmark Icon (on the Bookmark Toolbar) with the site favicon !?! Live Bookmarks cannot also be reordered by Drag and Drop. Reproducible: Always</description>

      <title>Holding down ctrl should display access key for tabs 1-9</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Opera/9.00 (Windows NT 5.0; U; en) Build Identifier: Firefox 1.5 introduced pressing ctrl+(1-9) to select tabs 1-9. Displaying the access key would make easier to determine which number you should press to select that tab. E.g. For tab number 8 for example, it's probably more work to count up to that tab to work out that it is number 8 than to select it some other way. A visual cue would also improve the discoverability of this feature. Suggestions: - replace the favicon with stylised icons numbered 1-9 - replace the title instead, and keep displaying the favicons - display it some other way, e.g. a small tab below each tab.

      <title>Removing Bookmark Toolbar is hard/unintuitive</title>

I knew this was possible because I've done it before, but it took me a long time to find out how to do it. This bug is to suggest improving the context menus to make this easier. It seems that the context menu on parts of the navigation toolbar includes options to enable/disable both the navigation toolbar and the bookmarks toolbar. Right-clicking on the navigation toolbar is not the intuitive thing to do when you want to remove the bookmarks toolbar. Right clicking on the bookmarks toolbar itself shows a menu that is entirely related to bookmarks and doesn't have a "remove" option. I'd like to suggest that the option to enable/disable the bookmarks toolbar is either moved from the navigation toolbar to the bookmarks toolbar, or is shown on both context menus. (There is an obvious issue about how to get a toolbar back once you have removed it...) Cheers, Phil. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce:</description>

There is a dropdown list where you can set the minimum font-size. Unfortunately there are only a few entries you can select from and you can not enter your own values. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: Dropdown minimum font-size list. Actual Results: List contains a few entries but you can not define your own ones. Expected Results: The box should be user-editable so that you can type your own values in. Or: The list should contain more entries. The very big ones could be removed, but 4,5,6,7,8 should be in there. The reason for this enhancement request is, that the minimum font-size is often used to make webpages with small font-sizes more readable. In the dropdown-list the maximum minimum font-size is 9 but 9 is quite big in my opinion. I don't want to make the fonts really big, but I want to make fonts with font-size:4px readable. Additional in the dialog there is no infomation which unit the minimum-font-size has. Is it pt or px?</description>

Expected Results: The folder should stay open for x milliseconds (e.g., 2000 ms = 2 secs) so the user can verify that (a) the bookmark was really placed there (good feedback practice, and a natural human distrust of computers), and (b) the dropped bookmark was placed in the correct location (this is exacerbated by there not being an indicator for the drop-target). It would also be nice if, while the folder is still open, the user could perform actions on the open folder (e.g., go-to/edit/delete/move a(nother) bookmark).</description>

I already know that I want to go to a given web address before I have even brought the url entry field into focus and it is something I think that the web browser itself should be able to determine without me doing something that is almost entirely redundant like typing alt+D or ctrl+L when there are no other text fields in focus in the webpage or in the browser such as the search bar and the find bar. I have also noticed that currently it is not possible to to use the alt+enter shortcut to force a url to open in a new tab if one hides the navigation toolbar. It makes no sense to force the user to use the mouse to select open in a new tab from a drop down box or to have them open the tab first when alt+enter already provides an appropriate way to handle this. It also does not seem to be possible to set this and other keybindings by default from the GUI. The status bar should also have the ability to only show itself when a page is loading without the need for an extension like autohide-statusbar. Leaving the status bar active at all times is not really desireable given that I can view more of a web page without scrolling with the bar hidden most of the time. I also think that it would be a good idea to have ctrl+c automatically copy a url to the clipboard if no other text is selected; in conjunction with ctrl+v automatically summoning the urlbar with the pasted contents of the clipboard already filled in, or simply filling in the urlbar with the copied text if no other text field is active. It would also be nice to have a paste and go feature out of the box. I am aware of hacks and extensions that do this but it would still be nice to not need an extension or hack for something like that. Reproducible: Always</description>

It reduces the amount of clicks required for the most common usage of the URL bar (selecting the URL to either copy it or overwrite it with an entirely different URL) by one click while increasing the amount of clicks required for a less common use (appending something to an existing URL) by one click. Editing a URL is unaffected as a single-click-and-drag operation still works when the URL is not selected. The historic reason this isn't enabled on Unix is because of the copy buffer issue. This is invalid, as the initial selection doesn't overwrite the X copy buffer in Firefox. This must be made explicit by reselecting the URL. On modern Unix desktops this historic problem is simply a nuisance to people who neither use nor know about the X copy buffer. All they see is Firefox acting differently to how it does on Windows. And as stated above, because the initial select doesn't overwrite the contents of the X buffer, people who *do* use it (which includes me, all day long) are unaffected. Changing this would make Firefox 2 nicer to use on Unix. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Decide to select the current URL, either to do something with it or to overwrite it. 2. Click in the URL bar, once. Actual Results: The caret moves to the point where the URL was clicked. Nothing is selected. For the most common use of the URL bar, the user must first pause to figure out what happened, then double-click to get the desired action. Expected Results: The whole URL is copied. It may be dragged about or deleted and overwritten. Unix nerds are overjoyed to find that their X copy buffers still contain whatever they did before. Almost all open bugs containing the term "clickselectsall" are counter-bugs to this of one form or another. Should this be adopted, expect the usual wailing and gnashing of teeth. it should be made abundantly clear in the release notes that the initial click doesn't copy in X so as to reduce said teeth-grinding (although as noted above this is merely confusion; the change is non-destructive).</description>

As Firefox doesn't have any UI to enable it, and having it disabled by default doesn't seem to be very useful, it should be enabled by default. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Start typing the name of a site you commonly visit in the URL bar. Actual Results: The URL dropdown appears, but because Firefox's built-in inline autocomplete is disabled by default with no UI to activate it, it goes unnoticed and unloved. Expected Results: After a few characters, Firefox's built-in inline autocomplete saves you time by allowing you to just stab Enter if the autocomplete shows the correct site. This is noticed and loved. IE has the same pref, but has UI for enabling it. Firefox not only disables the pref by default, it doesn't even create it in prefs.js so the key must be manually added. This is sufficiently geekazoid to dissuade most people from bothering.</description>

      <description>I just accidently middle-clicked the "Latest headlines" bookmark. All I can say is ouch! 39 tabs were simultaneously loading, and my whole computer hung for a good while. bsmedberg had a good suggestion: we should protect against (accidently) opening too many tabs at once. This would be similar to how we warn before opening a window with existing tabs. So if, for example, the user tries to open 5 or more tabs at once, we would put up a dialog, asking if this is really appropriate. Comments, ideas?</description>

FF does some of these, including from the google box, but not only does it use inconsistent modifers (bug 237027), it doesn't work for form submits. Would it be possible to add this? I use it a lot in Safari. Reproducible: Always</description>

      <title>sites visited contains spyware through the browser</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.2) Gecko/20060308 Firefox/1.5.0.2 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.2) Gecko/20060308 Firefox/1.5.0.2 Whenever a site is visited, the spyware goes through the links in firefox. While searching for information on the various search engines the spyware links firefox as the channel or route the spyware gets recorded. When I run a spyware removal program, it picks up the link and shows the spyware in a folder on my computer and it shows it going through firefox to implant tracking cookies. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.Go to any search engine and do a search on whatever subject picked 2. 3. Actual Results: The results show firefox link and shows the links into my folders. One of the links is going through (Data miner)and linking up with companies putting sypware on my system for montioring. Expected Results: When I use the spyware remover it recovers the spyware for deletion. My system is restored to its normal processes. Each time I run firefox, I can expect the spyware to return, due to the pattern I get. This problem is solved by another browser and it eliminates all traces of spyware. The spyware goes through different links established by the site itself and the implanting of the spyware goes through their site and bypasses your browser. I would like to see a spyware remover installed with the browser to eliminate any spyware going through the browser to obtain information to the sites I visit. It would be great to have the spyware remover be activated by clicking on the menu bar button so the user call scan for the spyware and remove it. That would be a huge help. I clear my visited websites when I suppect the spyware continues to load to track personal information.</description>

      <title>Cookie exceptions list needs same search/filter functionality as View Cookies list</title>

Sorry. But the fact remains and has remained for years now that it would be quite simple for this functionality to be added, but 3 years on and several versions later, someone with bug-closing permissions apparently remains close-minded about it (no pun intended). ANY large list needs a filter. Period. It is sillier still to keep fighting against a functionality that ALREADY EXISTS in a similar dialog (View Cookies) in the same application... Please re-reconsider this important option for those of us who are using the exceptions list as I think it was designed to be used, and accumulating hundreds of exceptions regularly. The only other thing that makes sense is removing the Cookie Exceptions functionality altogether...and I am NOT advocating that. Sorry about the "tude", but this is clearly an issue that should not have lasted this long or suffered so much debate, especially considering the relatively small effort involved. Reproducible: Always Actual Results: Intense frustration of trying to adjust my cookie exceptions and going ballistic as I scroll through the enormous list, not finding what I need to find...</description>

Now it jumps to the next whitespace. But since when is that used in a URL? It would be more ligical to jump to useful locations, like '/' or '.'. That in combination with '+shift' makes it much faster to edit a (for example mis-typed) url. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Have a (semi)long url in the locationbar and focus it 2. Press Control+left/right-arrow 3. Actual Results: Jumps to next whitespace as in any other textfield. Expected Results: Jump to '/' or '.', or any other useful character.</description>

      <title>Implement pie-chart throbber</title>
      <description>Visual indication of page load progress is currently split across two locations in the browser. The throbber indicates that some type of network loading is going on, and the horizontal progress bar gives a SWAG of the overall progress of that load. To get a full picture, a user must look in both places. Additionally, there is no equivalent of the horizontal progress meter on background pages. One way of combining both the throbber and the progress meter would be to use a pie chart inside the throbber ring that progressively fills in until the load is complete. Art to follow.</description>

      <title>it would be nice if users get notified if they are running buggy plugins</title>
      <description>it would be nice if users get notified if they are running buggy plugins. while it is difficult to keep track of all the warez plugins, i believe that the majority of users who have plugins have java(tm), flash(tm) and maybe some porn watching plugin. so eventually someone keeps tracks of the known not buggy version of the above plugins for the user's OS, some javascript (the js does *NOT* need chrome privileges) compares the versions from navigator.plugins[i] and if the user is running a buggy version he is given a message about the problem and an url to install the new version. this may be done from a web page and eventually from chrome. there are worms in the wild targetting java(tm) applets and since the application is firefox, users may think it is firefox's fault. imho technical non-savvy users don't check for new versions of java(tm)/flash(tm).</description>

If I type in: \home\user\path\myfile.ext Firefox will happily save the file with name "\home\user\path\myfile.ext". However, the user clearly meant to save it as myfile.ext in path /home/user/path. I know '\' is valid char in file, but considering the Windows's usage of backslash as path separator, we can reasonably assume here \ means / indeed. FF can quitely convert \ to /, or give users warnings and an chance to make the change manually. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Click a link/button that does a download 2. (With Always ask when download file enabled) type in \home\user\path\myfile.ext in the File Name: 3. Click OK Actual Results: FF Save the file as "\home\user\path\myfile.ext" Expected Results: It should save it as myfile.ext in /home/user/path instead or give a warning to user for manual change.</description>

I want a way to increase (or simply set) the limit on the maximum number of cookies stored by Firefox beyond the current (reported) limit of 300. The reason: I have set up accounts at hundreds of related websites that I would like to visit in a systematic way on a regular basis (i.e., run through all of them in the same day, a few times a month). I'd like to be able to log in to all of them and have all the cookies persist for the maximum amount of time (expiration date on each cookie is one month after creation date). Unfortunately, by the time I finish logging in to the last of the sites, the earlier ones have already lost their cookies, so I have to log in again. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Create accounts at over 300 websites that use cookies to "remember" you on your next visit. 2. Log in to all of the sites. 3. Revisit the first few sites you logged in to. Actual Results: The sites don't remember you, so you have to log in again. Expected Results: The sites do remember you, so you don't have to log in again until the site's cookies actually expire according to their set expiration date.</description>

The value of dom.max_script_run_time in FF 1.5.0.2 is 5 second. It seems to be too low compare to what IE offers.

To compare it with IE: IE timesout after executing 5,000,000 statements on current page. http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=175500 Wouldn't it be a good idea to set dom.max_script_run_time to 60 sec or something like that in FF by default (I mean something reasonably high)?

      <title>Spell check feature request</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.2) Gecko/20060308 Firefox/1.5.0.2 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.2) Gecko/20060308 Firefox/1.5.0.2 A simple, robust spell check would be a very nice addition to Firefox (or as an extension). Suggested implementation: exactly like Google Toolbar's spell check. Reproducible: Always Why I requested this feature: I searched for Firfox spell check extensions on and off the Mozilla site, but the ones I found are either incompatible with Windows or with new versions of Firefox. I'm going to install Google Toolbar for it's spell check, but it would be nice to get just spell check without the other Google Toolbar clutter.</description>

      <title>Raw MIME type should be displayed in Open/Save Dialog, not only human readable file type description</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.12) Gecko/20051221 Firefox/1.0.7 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.12) Gecko/20051221 Firefox/1.0.7 Klicking on a link with a MIME type that cannot be opened by FF shows a dialog where I can choose to save the file or maybe open it in another helper app. The Description of the file type seems to be derived from the extension, not the MIME type. It is taken from some kind of registry or if no match is found it is constructed by capitalizing the file extension. On the internet, generally the MIME type is more important than the file extension, so I suggest that the mime type is displayed to the user as well, maybe instead of the current text, maybe in addition to it. For protocols where no MIME type is available (FTP, file, ...), the MIME type might be omitted, displayed as "unknown", derived from the registry or whatever approach you prefer. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Klick link to extension displayable by FF or a plugin and some unrecognized or save-only MIME type. E.g. *.pdf sent as application/octet-stream 2. Klick link with unknown MIME type and known but non-unique file extension. E.g. *.dat for application/ms-tnef (from bug #293804) Actual Results: 1. FF describes the File as a "PDF File" but does not open it inline. It is difficult for an average user to guess where this different behaviour does come from. You have chosen to open foo.pdf which is a: PDF File (*) open using acroread ( ) save to disk 2. FF shows the (probably incorrect) file type description known for this extension, but does not offer the MIME type, which hopefully would be unique and might be of more use to the user. You have chosen to open bar.dat which is a: MS Video File (*) open using mpeg player ( ) save to disk Expected Results: 1. "foo.pdf is of type application/octet-stream and would be handled by your OS as a PDF File" 2. "bar.dat is of type application/ms-tnef and would be handled by your OS as a MS Video File" Related Bugs: bug #140975 comment #9 describes the same problem. bug #293804 comment #4 is the same thing in TB. bug #276009 is where I got the URL from, and about default option. bug #57342 is about choosing what to do with unknown/incorrect MIME types.</description>

      <title>More explanation on global installation of extensions/themes</title>

Or I could have written this to webmaster of Extension website if it was possible. When I saw that "DOM Inspector" is an extension and it's available to every user, I was convinced that it's possible to install extension in a system-wide manner. So, last week, I searched in Google on how to do this and I spent TWO whole hours to get to know that I need to use "-install-global-extension" parameter. I mean, this piece of information, so important and so trivial, is mentioned no where! Not in Extension website, nor in Firefox's Help. Could you add it somewhere very accessible? PS: Maybe it would be nicer to have an easier way to install an extension in a system-wide manner. Reproducible: Always</description>

      <title>After update warn users specifically of firewall problem</title>
      <description>See bug 308979. Many users refuse to believe a firewall causes failure to connect after an update, and blame Firefox. For some, no amount of persuasion suffices. If the program is smart enough to detect a connection failure, the user is more likely to believe a well-placed error message than random users on a support forum. After an update is completed the warning should state that the firewall configuration may need editing and that the user should consult the firewall help documentation (or preferably, Firefox documentation -- see bugs 308979 and 308982).</description>

However, photos are usually named 1.jpg, 2.jpg, 3.jpg... So, I have to prepend some letters to distinguse between several web pages (a1.jpg, a2.jpg, b1.jpg, b2.jpg...). Could you add below "Save As...", menu item "Save As www.example.org/someDir/1.jpg" (full URI as file name on the disk)? File might have name "wwwexampleorgsomeDir1.jpg" (without special chars like ":" and "/") or file could be stored in directory "www.example.org" which have subdirectory "someDir".

      <title>Feature Suggestion: Web Applications as plug-ins</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.12) Gecko/20050915 Firefox/1.0.7 (ax) Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.12) Gecko/20050915 Firefox/1.0.7 (ax) It would be great if Mozilla further helped the transition to web based applications by allowing users to semi-permanently install web based application files within an add/remove style console in Firefox. For instance, instead of having to download from scratch an application like www.writely.com everytime the user uses it (or every time they clear their temporary internet files/cache), it could be installed and managed like a plugin of sorts (of course updates would automatically occur if changes are made to that web based application.) Now, the example I gave there (writely) is a relatively small application and takes very little time to download on a broadband connection, however much larger applications such as Google Earth could be moved entirely to the web with this kind of architecture.

      <title>Tabbed browsing lacks intuitive features, suggestions</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.2) Gecko/20060308 Firefox/1.5.0.2 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.2) Gecko/20060308 Firefox/1.5.0.2 Hello! I was unable to find the proper avenue in the Feedback section to submit two suggestions for improving the Firefox browser. So I thought a bug report would be an appropriate alternative, since more critical users could feasably consider these as bugs. I think these ideas will probably be easy to implement and will significantly improve Firefox's tabbed browsing experience. First, when the user right-clicks on some arbitrary link and selects "Open Link in a New Tab" from the popup menu, the new Tab should become the active tab. In other words, select the new tab for me so I can view the new page without having to select it myself. Currently, the existing page stays active and I have to click on the new tab to view the new page I just opened. I think it's reasonable to assume that the user wants to see the new page immediately when she opens it in a new tab. My second suggestion has to do with opening a new tab from scratch, either by selecting File-&gt;New Tab from the main browser window or by using the Ctrl+N hotkey mneumonic. The current version of Firefox defaults to a blank page, but I think there should be three options: 1. blank page, 2. current page, and 3. home page. The option could be set globally in the Tabs section of the Options dialog, so that every new tab will default to the current page, home page, or a blank page, whatever the user has specified. I hope these suggestions are helpful and find their way into a futre revision of Firefox. Thanks for considering them, and thanks for helping to pioneer the way toward viable alternatives to Microsoft products. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.a. Right-click any hyperlink and select "Open Link in a New Tab". 1.b. Observe that the new tab with the new web page is not active, you have to select that tab to see the new page. 2.a. Select File-&gt;New Tab (or press Ctrl+N). 2.b. Observe that the new tab only opens a blank page, and no options exist to default to the current page or the user's home page instead.</description>

The builder is probably using the old 1.5 packaging and simply placing the new bits in it. They should also be modifying the reg key values that are written by the installer so they match what is written by the autoupdate process (which looks like it writes the keys using dynamic information from the files that are deployed). By having two different sets of data written depending upon which installation method is chosen (installer vs. autoupdate), it makes it more difficult for systems management solutions to identify which version is installed. By using a consistent set of reg keys regardless of installer process, customers can get a better experience and better manage future updates to the product as they'll have a consistent way of seeing what version is installed. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. install 1.5.0.3 using the full installer exe 2. review the reg keys under HKLM\Software\Mozilla 3. install 1.5.0.3 via autoupdate from a prior version, on a separate machine from above 4. review the reg keys under HKLM\Software\Mozilla 5. Note the differences between the reg keys for the Mozilla Firefox key, and the GeckoVer for the two types of installs. Actual Results: When I install 1.5.0.3 by downloading the exe and installing it, I get HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Mozilla\Mozilla Firefox 1.5 When I install 1.5.0.3 via autoupdate, I get HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Mozilla\Mozilla Firefox 1.5.0.3 When I install 1.5.0.3 by downloading the exe and installing it, I get GeckoVer = 1.7.5 When I install 1.5.0.3 via autoupdate, I get GeckoVer = 1.8.0.3 Expected Results: The reg key and the reg value between the two types of installs should be the same. They should reflect the true versions HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Mozilla\Mozilla Firefox 1.5.0.3 and GeckoVer = 1.8.0.3</description>

Firefox has one really annoying gremlin - it doesn't follow the precident set in the Mosaic/Netscape days for abbreviations defaulting to the .com site appropriate to the abreviation in its URL window - i.e type boats you'll get boats.com fine, but type houses and you'll get http://www.parliament.uk/ - wtf? - that's because it's basically taking whatever sits at the number one slot of google's search list... How long before that's an paid for advert? I can see with open source that there'd be nothing to stop this being an option in preferences - but why make this a dafault? - especially as there's a google window sitting right next to the URL window. Sooner or later one of the big boys who's paid a lot for their domain name is going to litigate because their links are effectively diverting to a rival I'd have thought? Couple of forum debates about it at your forums and here too http://forums.maccentral.com/wwwthreads/showthreaded.php?Cat=&amp;Board=general&amp;Number=838814&amp;page=0&amp;view=expanded&amp;sb=5&amp;o=7 Reproducible: Always</description>

This means that I have to navigate back to the menu I sorted to be able to carry on working with it. Would be much better (and it does so in IE, or Windows Menus) if sorting didn't close the menu, but rather resorted the itesm only. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.Open Bookmarks menu 2.Select any bookmark and right click on it 3.Select Sort By Name Actual Results: Bookmarks sorted, menu closes. Expected Results: Bookmakrs sorted, menu stays open. I hope it is not a duplicate - since I tried searching for it, but failed. :-(</description>

      <title>Bookmark menu should remain displayed when performing actions on it</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.3) Gecko/20060426 Firefox/1.5.0.3 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.3) Gecko/20060426 Firefox/1.5.0.3 The bookmark menu (whether it be the Bookmarks menu, or a Bookmark button menu) should remain visible after an operation is performed on it. Including but not limited to: - Sort by Name - Delete - New Separator - New Folder - New Bookmark This is mainly a usability enhancement, as it is probably working as designed, but the design is suboptimal. There are two main reasons for this: 1) User feedback should be provided so that the user can confirm the operation was successful. When you right-click on an item in a bookmark menu then choose Delete and then the whole menu dissappears, it does not instill confidence that the action was successful. 2) When a user is in "bookmark management" mode, they will most likely perform OTHER bookmark management tasks in the same session. So if a user right-clicks in a bookmark menu to create a folder, they will most likely want to move bookmarks into that new folder. When the menu disappears, it makes it more cumbersome to continue working on bookmark organization. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Click the Bookmarks menu 2. Right-click somewhere below the first separator, in the user's bookmarks section. 3. Click on New Folder... 4. Click OK to accept the default name Actual Results: Bookmarks menu closes/disappears. Expected Results: Bookmarks menu should remain visible. The current design forces the user to click more than necessary when performing bookmark maintenance via the right-click menu. Also, the importance of user feedback can't be overstated. Displaying the menu after the user clicks a function is a great way to provide visible feedback that the action was taken and allow for further bookmark management tasks.</description>

Maybe it should be a plugin like flash, but since the library is free why not include it directly. WHY INCLUDE: Wikipedia exclusively provides Ogg Vorbis formats. Grandma has no idea what an Ogg file is, but she clicks on Beethoven Symphony and saves a file to her hard drive. Wouldn't clicking and getting music help promote Firefox as full featured. WHY NOT INCLUDE: If it increases the binary size by a significant amount. This could allow more sites to play annoying music (but they already do using flash). Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Go to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bessie_Brown 2. Click on Media File, "Song From A Cotton Field" 3. Firefox asks you to save file Actual Results: 3. Firefox asks you to save file Expected Results: 3. Firefox brings up window with play button/or plays song (Bessie Brown page included because it is small and easy to find song; Beethoven has tons of info before media file).</description>

But now there's something new: one can write something at it, and then select the search engine at the Quick Searches submenu to start searching. Meaning that writing "g ..." wouldn't be necessary. Manage Quick Searches would have options to add, edit, delete or sort them. I think this is useful to making things easier to the end user. Reproducible: Always</description>

      <title>Disable location bar hiding by default, to make chrome spoofing harder</title>
      <description>Firefox has had support for a cool anti-phishing microbar that shows the true location of a page even on popups that disable the full-size location bar, simply by changing the pref dom.disable_open_window_feature.location to true. When we first tried setting this before Firefox 1.0 shipped (see bug 22183 comment 120 and following) and got a lot of pushback. Now that Firefox is more established, and phishing is understood to be a serious problem by a broader range of the web audience, it may be appropriate to finally do this in Firefox-2.</description>

Now Flash is a major weapon for all the marketing companies. It is a major migrane inducer, waster of time and snatcher of network bandwidth. Having installed Flash I don't seem to be able to uninstall it for Firefox. It would be really nice to identify rogue sites in my options page, and block Flash presentations on them for good. This is an enhancement request. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: Some sites eg http://www.guardian.co.uk/ have dancing ads that chase you down the page asking you to participate in a survey. At least sometimes they have the manners to close themselves if you refuse to reply. Meanwhile pratts at Manchester Online have come up with this gem: http://www.manchesteronline.co.uk/ls/gmgmanol/jobs/advert?adId=10738247&amp;sid=801985C80034088421&amp;pos=17&amp;src=search&amp;tot=500&amp;page=2&amp;src=search Mouse-over the RBS ad at the top of the page and you get the famous pink dancing slipper ad (in Flash 8) that won't close at all and obscures the page. These people shouldn't be allowed a mouse. So please, please Mozilla people, give me the option to ban Flash on a site by site basis. Please. Actual Results: I can't switch off Flash. Expected Results: I would really like to selectively ban the scourge of Flash. Given me the ability to selectively ban Flash on various sites via the Options panel.</description>

It's a shock/DOS site that uses javascript and flash to spawn windows showing disturbing pictures and then launches email windows until the computer crashes. I believe there are is no actual vulnerability in firefox itself , but rather in flash. Still I had an idea : If Firefox (or indeed all the mozilla products) had a limit to how many windows it could open in a given timeframe , no matter what spawned the window, it could seriously diminish the effect of such an attack. I imaging that this would require a minimum time between calls for new windows to spawn .. if something tries to open windows faster than what is humanly possible (it takes time to find a link and click on it) then either the new windows are not opened or they are delayed. The delaytime would increase as long as firefox deems that the attack is still in progress - This would give a user time to close windows before they have a chance to open new windows. There should also be a minimum number of windows that would be allowed to open without delay at first so benign scripts that open a few windows would not be affected.

This is extremely cumbersome and inefficient. If I use google as default, I want to have a quick way to do rarer searches without having to go through those menus (and then change BACK after!). I suggest adding configurable keyboard shortcuts to the search providers. It would work as follows: 1- Default search provider is Google. When I type a search term and hit [Enter], search goes via Google. This is current behavior. 2- I add Wikipedia as a search provider. 3- I assign Wikipedia search provider a keyboard shortcut, ie Ctrl+W 4- Shortcuts are only active when focus is on the search pane, therefore not interfering with global shortcuts. 5- I type a search term in the search box and hit Ctrl+W. My search goes through Wikipedia. My default search provider remains Google, so I don't have to change back for my future searches. As you can see, this would allow the use of multiple search providers *simultaneously*. This is MUCH less painful than having to manually change my provider every time I use a different genre of search engine... A task thats more cumbersome to me than just going directly to a search website. Reproducible: Always</description>

The most useful would be find and find &amp; replace. Also useful would be spell check or popping up a larger (but modal?) window to edit the text with (cf. OmniWeb). For a good example of how this would be useful, edit a very large Wiki page. Thanks! Reproducible: Always</description>

      <title>Support JS for adding search engines that matches IE's API (provide a way to install search engines from web script)</title>
      <description>According to http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/searchguide/default_new.mspx# , IE7 will support "window.external.AddSearchProvider(‘URL’) where ‘URL’ points to an OpenSearch description document" to add an engine to the browser. Although there doesn't seem to be a standard API for such things, it'd be nice if we could make use of the same mechanism, in addition to our window.sidebar.addSearchEngine().</description>

      <title>Search UI Enhancement: Search Engine Targets (toolbar icons)</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.3) Gecko/20060426 Firefox/1.5.0.3 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.3) Gecko/20060426 Firefox/1.5.0.3 Bug 328343 (Multiple search toolbars) is similar, but completion of this enhancement request would resolve that one as well. The problem: People frequently search multiple sites. To do this, they have to select the engine of choice using the engine drop-down and then enter their search term. Alternately searching multiple sites takes longer than it needs to. The solution: Create Search Engine Targets, which are icons on the toolbar. When a Search Engine Target is clicked, the term inside the search box is searched on that search engine. Example: I regularly search Google, Wikipedia, and IMdb. Once this enhancement is implemented, I can place a Search Engine Target for each of these sites next to my Search Box. To search a site, I simply type my search terms into the existing Search Box and then click on the search engine of choice. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: This is an enhancement request.</description>

      <title>"Reload Live Bookmarks in this folder"</title>
      <description>At the moment I have a folder on my bookmarks toolbar with 4 of the most important live bookmarks. When I want to refresh them, I have three options: - right-click on every livemark separately and choose: "Reload Live Bookmark"; - in about:config change the pref that makes reload ALL livemarks more frequently; - install the Reliby extension that adds a button on the toolbar "Reload all Live Bookmarks". The problem is, that I don't want to reload ALL livemarks, but only the ones in a certain folder. But when I right-click on the folder, I miss the "Reload Live Bookmarks in this Folder" option.</description>

      <title>Clicking "Sign In" Causes SSL2 Error 12281</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; WinFX RunTime 3.0.50727) Build Identifier: 1.5.0.3 Detailed Summary: Beginning 15 May 2005, trying to log into any site using SSL2 gives the following error message as a dialog: "www.foo.com as sent an incorrect or unexpected message. Error Code: -12281" Searching on the web (including mozilla.org) reveals that this is the most general of SSL errors that can be thrown by a client. This problem also occurs with Mozilla Firefox on my co-worker's computer. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open http://www.google.com [or any website, bugzilla included, that uses SSL2]. 2. Click "Sign In" [try to login to bugzilla]. Actual Results: Error message dialog pops up: "www.google.com as sent an incorrect or unexpected message. Error Code: -12281" Expected Results: Firefox should either ignore this error code or perform as it did before 15 May 2005 The first disclaimer to this bug is that, yes, it seems to be a problem with the server sending bad SSL data to Firefox. HOWEVER, the reasons I wrote the bug are a) very little was returned regarding this error doing a google search on the web, b) a full uninstall and re-install of Firefox (minus deleting the Windows Registry entries for Firefox) did not resolve the problem, c) starting in safe mode did not solve the problem, d) disabling SSL2 simply makes a different error message appear, e) the problem occurs on any website using SSL2, and f) the problem occurs on more than one independent computer running Firefox. I have not duplicated the problem from my home, so it is possible that the error is being caused by the way data is being handled here at work. Needless to say, this bug is being written using filthy IE6 instead of my much preferred Mozilla browser.</description>

      <title>Ctrl+9 to select last tab instead of ninth tab, ala IE 7</title>
      <description>I found this a very nice shortcut in the IE 7 betas. By the time you have enough tabs open to want to select the seventh, eighth, or ninth, you probably can't tell which of those is which. So, really, Ctrl+9 isn't that useful as we have it now. IE 7 has Ctrl+9 as the shortcut to select the last tab, which I currently have to do by hitting Ctrl+Tab a bunch of times.</description>

This may make it slightly easier for users to understand/make the feature more discoverable, and would make the overall UI more coherent. Reproducible: Always</description>

I said ok and made up root dns server that has wildcard record returning one IP for any query. DNS &amp; access things works well, but when connection gets paid Firefox has forged name - IP pairs in cache. Pressing clear private data don't help, there's no clear DNS cache in preferences. Only restarting Firefox seems to clear DNS cache and that's suboptimal. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Forge DNS answers. 2. Try to clear cache. 3. At least I don't know how and I end up restarting Firefox. Actual Results: Not much, this bug is only annoying not severe. Expected Results: Wrong IP name pairs in cache. I think check box "clear also dns cache when you clean private data" would be best solution for this problem. I had this problem with Linux 1.5.0.3 and 3.0a1.</description>

Whatever descriptive text we decide to use (if we decide to use any) should also be set to the tooltip of the URL / location bar. The text might be "Enter a URL to visit a webpage", or something... better... Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. open a new tab or enter about:blank into the URL box, or just go the old-fashioned way and remove the text in the URL / location bar It is kinda rare that the URL bar is empty /and/ doesn't have focus. When new tabs are opened, the URL bar /has/ focus, but if you click a way (e.g. to select the search engine box) it's blank and doesn't have focus - so why not stick some text in there?</description>

Regardless of selected search in the searchbox. This don't happens any more. The right-click search use the latest selected search engine. And this is silly. If for example you select some text and like to search the web for this, and the latest engine selected was "ubuntu package search" It should be nice to have an option on that, since this mean that you first have to select example google/yahoo,etc . Then do the select text and right-click search It was easier in 1.5 Reproducible: Always</description>

      <title>per tab switch to switch audio on / off to get rid of annoying ads sounds</title>

This is at least disturbing but gets really worse with lots of tabs open, a couple of them producing sounds at the same time. This request for enhancement asks for a new feature to handle this issue. I don't know how the system works and how much control the browser can get on plug-ins (often ads are macromedia flashs these days). From the users point of view I can think of two possible implementations: i) a new entry in the tab's context menue providing an audio toggle, only affecting this tab. ii) a general adjustment (preferences) with allows to have the active tab only send audio to the system. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: Browse e.g. the following site for a example of a flash ads http://www.jumpcut.com/</description>

      <title>Safebrowsing: 'Get me out of here' should go to the default home page</title>
      <description>When you come upon a phishy site, the 'Get me out of here' link should do something different. Throwing out some ideas here: - Take you to www.google.com or www.mozilla.com if only one tab open - close the tab and focus on tab you came from if more then one tab open - Take you back as if the back button was hit - if you didn't come from anywhere (ex opened the link in a new tab) close the tab - if that was the only tab open then load google.com or www.mozilla.com - Would say load the homepage but for people that have multiple that would open a few tabs which would be annoying. (currently something like this happens but only the first tab is loaded with the same text as in the tools-&gt;options-&gt;general-&gt;'location(s)' shows) Hmm too many ifs. Guess you should just be taken to google.com or mozilla.com</description>

When you enter a url to such a feed into the location bar and go to that feed, mozilla will display such a nicely formatted page (for example, enter, in a capable firefox browser, into the location bar http://www.sciam.com/xml/sciam.xml ). I'd like there to be an option, for a live bookmark's right-click context menu in the bookmarks menu, to open the live bookmark in this view. -- To currently get this view, you have to right-click on the live bookmark in the bookmarks menu, choose properties, highlight then copy the feed location entry, which will be the url to the feed, dismiss the modal dialogue, hightlight whatever's in your location bar and paste the feed location's copied entry and hit enter. Firefox may then requery the feed's url (I'm not certain if it does, and perhaps it needn't always, should my feature request be implemented, as it might already have that information), and finally display the nicely formatted page, with links and synopses.

      <description>[rfe] import wizard needs some branding when I first run firefox (or thunderbird) I get the import wizard. and while there is some branding (at least on windows xp, if you look at the task bar), the import wizard itsself has no branding to indicate that this dialog is from firefox (or tbird). perhaps we could add a firefox logo (tbird logo) to this first wizard page or to the top area ("Import Settings And Data From") or to the title of the window? I'll attach a screen shot. also, maybe "Import Settings And Data From" should be ""Import Settings And Data"?

Allowing data: and file: protocols will open up new possibilities such as side-by-side searches of multiple sites, prompting for secondary variables (e.g., driving directions), and automatic parsing (of dates for instance, or names in both "Last, First" and "First Last" forms). Even more can be done with chrome:, like searching the local computer/network or bookmarks/browsing history/downloads/feeds/tabs/etc., configuring secondary variables on the fly (driving directions start/end, results per page), locally saved persistent results, and other applications that I can't yet imagine. Security shouldn't be an issue, because data: and file: in this use are merely frontends for HTTP, and any abuse from a chrome: search could just as easily come from a non-search extension. I think the change would be valuable; can anyone give a reason why it should not be implemented? Reproducible: Always</description>

Use case: User opens two tabbed browser windows. User drags multiple tabs from window number one to window number two with the intent to open the dropped tabs from window number one as new tabs in window number two (tab-to-tab drag and drop). Current behavior: When a tab bar becomes full in a target tabbed browser window, the drop target area is limited to small area above currently open tabs (only a few pixels). Using a resolution of 1024x768 with a window spanning half the screen width, this condition is reached with only three open tabs in the target tabbed browser window. Suggestion: Increasing tab-to-tab drop target area to include bottom status bar and toolbar area. i.e. dragging a tab to these areas would open the page as a new tab in the target tabbed browser window. Suggest no change in behavior of the two current tab drop targets (url box target &amp; specific tab target). Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.Open two tabbed-browser Firefox windows each covering half the screen width. 2.Create 5 tabs in the window on the left. Create two tabs in the right window. 3.Attempt to drag all tabs from the window on the left into the window on the right using existing drop target.</description>

      <title>preprocessor.pl could read variables from DTD files</title>
      <description>We were talking about file formats in l10n in bug 340173 and I wonder if we could add reading variables from DTD files to preprocessor.pl. We have reoccuring bugs about whitespace trouble due to -I being really just an inclusion of the file, and it allows for other "code injections", too. As bsmedberg talked about adding loading stringbundles from DTD files, it may be cute for l10n to allow preprocessor vars to be read from DTDs, too.</description>

      <description>In addition to the JS API to let a page ask to be added to the list of available search engines (see bug 337780), we should provide a way for sites to tell whether they're already in that list, so they can choose not to show the UI (e.g., a button) for adding themselves. Since we'll only want to let sites ask about their own engines, we'll need to be able to identify an engine by something more secure than its title (see bug 335012).</description>

      <title>Tie shortcuts, tooltips, etc. together for UI automation purposes</title>
      <description>Inspired by some discussion on IRC, this is an idea that we have code to automatically add keyboard shortcuts to tooltips. Presumably, this behavior would be controlled by a hidden pref. I claim it should be on by default, but that's open for debate; I think mconnor disagrees. The important point here is that if this were implemented, it should NOT be done by manually changing strings everywhere, but by programmatically attaching the shortcuts to the ends of the appropriate tooltips as necessary. This may be hard; I'm not sure we currently have a way of matching a tooltip to functionality (i.e. that the tooltip on the "Find Next" button matches the "Find Next" functionality). That would probably be a necessary first step. As a side effect of implementing this (mainly the aforementioned "first step"), we might be able to do some other snazzy things automatically, such as better link buttons/tooltips to help documentation, systematically disable showing tooltips in menus (if desired), or whatever.</description>

      <description>The backend doesn't support changing the local list data provider. To support that we would need to do the following: 1) Change the hard coded value in browser/components/safebrowsing/content/globalstore.js to change with data provider changes. 2) Determine a way to get blacklist/whitelist table names. This is currently a list hard coded in browser/components/safebrowsing/content/sb-loader.js. We could either: a) move to a pref, or b) add it to the update URL protocol. The benefit of (b) would be that providers can add/remove tables without requiring a client change.</description>

This means that millions of users don't know how to get problems fixed, and may switch to alternative products, revert to older (possibly insecure) versions, or invent cumbersome workarounds. Suggestion: Add a "Report a Bug" button that starts a wizard to report a bug, automatically filling in the product family, component, platform and OS. Plus ideally some automatically-captured breadcrumb trail of what the user was doing, with a wizard to ask (in lay language) which feature is affected. E.g. if the user had been in preferences and then certificate manager, but had to close the certificate manager window to get to the "report bug" window, the wizard would present checkboxes for both these components. The server-side (Bugzilla?) would then automatically show relevant open bugs for the component(s) selected - not all open bugs for all components. It should also allow for anonymous entry, for those too lazy or paranoid to sign up, and/or allow the user to create an account without losing the wizard-gathered information. I realize adding this kind of feature might overload bugzilla and the developers with rubbish. So it needs more computer smarts to filter it down and automatically identify duplicate real bugs. But we have more CPU power than we used to ... Reproducible: Always</description>

I can scroll the old page and everything behaves like it should even i can click on links which aborts the load process of digg.com. But making new tabs (mouse-middle) and new windows (shift-left) isn't possible. OT: spell check rocks!!! makes it lot easier for a non English guy like me :) Reproducible: Always</description>

      <title>Missing: Save as Web Archive</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.4) Gecko/20060508 Firefox/1.5.0.4 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.4) Gecko/20060508 Firefox/1.5.0.4 Firefox is just beautiful, in so many ways. However, there is still one reason to use IE. I've gotten to the point where I actually use ie for any online transaction, which really sucks - and that reason is "save as web archive". Now that people are using the web for serious things, it's more important that people keep all those confirmation numbers and information pages, and "save complete" is just such an ugly hack. PLEASE can we have save as mht file? Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: Run it, and go save as Actual Results: It doesn't allow you to save as a single file Expected Results: It should come on - I'm a developer - how hard would it be to do? You import a standard zip libary, and save everything into the zip in the same structure you currently save to disk - you make the page loader actually be able to read out of a zip - and you're done - half an hour development time for a "deal breaker" level feature. Sounds a good tradeoff to me!</description>

This should be added for 2.0 Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open 3 tabs, 3 different sites 2. View the first tab, then switch over to the last tab. 3. Close the last tab. Actual Results: 2nd tab becomes focused/displayed. Expected Results: Should have brought me back to the tab I was previously viewing (1st tab)... This particularly becomes an annoyance when browsing in the first tab on sites that open new tabs. -Opera browser has had this functionality (properly working tabs) for many years.</description>

IMHO, this is more intuitive and convenient. The user shouldn't unnecessarily be forced to go into a separate interface (the manager window) to make a small change in the interface in question (rearranging the engines). Besides this functionality already exists in the bookmarks menu. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.Click on the dropmarker in the search field to bring up the search engines list. 2.Try to drag an engine to another position within the list. Actual Results: Nothing happens Expected Results: The search engine should be moved to the new position.</description>

Bug: if I type /usr/bin/xmm, the widget tab completes for me to /usr/bin/xmms; however if I press enter, firefox gets /usr/bin/xmm back, and complains. Terrible-UI-ness: if I browse to /usr/bin (and why, as an end user, should I have to know about /usr/bin anyway?) it takes easily 15 seconds before it renders the list of applications in that folder. It's simply the worst file browser that I've ever seen. Why can't firefox instead use the open desktop menu standards, so that the user can pick and application from the gnome/kde/fluxbox/whatever menu? (Of course "advanced" users can be catered to with a text entry "advanced" option.) The widget really is terrible. Rather than fixing this bug, you should just dump it.

      <title>Tracking: Add full-text indexing to bookmark and/or history searches</title>
      <description>Now that SQLite, the back-end storage for Places, is going to support full-text indexing (http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/wiki?p=FullTextIndex), we can significantly enhance Firefox's search capabilities by searching more than titles and URLs. Among the design questions to be considered are what to index, how and where to display the results, and what options to support. This bug is intended to serve as both a tracking bug for individual portions of the work and a discussion point (in addition to mozilla.dev.apps.firefox) for design ideas.</description>

      <description>Include results from full-text searches (of history, bookmarks, or whatever pages have been added to the index) along with current results from searching titles and URLs. Results from those two searches should probably simply be merged, sorted by last visit. (SQLite might well do that merge automatically.) Results should include snippets from the result pages when possible.</description>

So for example I have both g and Google as keywords for the Google search and both dict and d for answers.com search. It would be useful for anyone who uses the quick searches as much as I do, if Firefox would take any abbreviated but unambiguous version of the keyword. We could then also use these abbreviations on misc computers such as library computers. Reproducible: Always</description>

      <title>Allow subscription to system's default feed handler</title>
      <description>A simpler solution to bug 339514 and about opposite to bug 327079, why not make it possible to pass feeds to the system's default feed handler through the feed protocol (where available/applicable)? This would solve the issue of feed handlers requiring special command line arguments (these would be added by the system's protocol registry) and might in the future also be used for getting a feed into the new feed registry introduced with IE7.</description>

The problem is, that the cross icon is displayed even if the page is not loading, and the spiral icon is displayed even when the page is already loading/reloading. I suggest to have one smart button that - when loading a page, it shows the cross icon and stops the loading when pressed; - when the page is loaded, it shows the spiral icon and reloads the page when pressed. This allows for a more logical interface. It would also save space, as the smart button replaces the two dumb buttons. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

This proposal applies to those cases of HTML documents where a #Fragment is not found in the above sense. Proposal FireFox should provide a user option to extend the fragment locator by automatically treating unfound fragments as find requests. Elements * Whether to do a Match Case find or not may be specified as a sub-option. * If the URI identifies a new document, the find context should be the top of the new document. * Otherwise, i.e. the link consists of only the fragment identiifier, the find context should be the position of the referencing A tag making the link. * A link containing any URI part (before the hash mark) is treated as a new document even if identifying the same one as currently displayed -- i.e. the find context is the top of the document. It is my belief that this proposed action is permitted by current HTTP and HTML architecture and specifications. Usage The proposal will be particularly useful in those cases where an author of one document wishes to refer to a part of another document but the author of the second document has not identified that part by an attribute in the markup. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: N/A Actual Results: N/A Expected Results: N/A Considering the failure to locate an anchor in the document matching a given Fragment Identifier to be an error, the user agent is free to correct that error with the user's consent, which consent may be in the form of a previously selected option. I refer you to the Error Handling section of Architecture of the World Wide Web (http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#error-handling). Also: http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Fragment.html</description>

Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Close a tab with content in it. 2. Mouse to History &gt; Recently Closed Tabs &gt; 3. Middle-click an entry. Actual Results: Bon Echo closes the menu, but does nothing. Expected Results: A new tab opens, "unclosing" that tab.</description>

      <title>Show overflow menus when right-click tab scroll buttons</title>
      <description>Right-clicking on a tab overflow scroll button should show a menu listing the tabs beyond that button for quick tab switching. To make this functionality more obvious dropmarkers should be added to the scroll buttons, and hence the arrows on the scroll buttons should really be a bit bigger, as in the suggested UI screenshot below (I pinched the arrows from print preview!) N.B. I'd also suggest a scrollbar be used for vertical scrolling, should these popups become too tall, since scrollbars are much more effective for scrolling through potentially long lists of things (whereas more 'standard' arrowscrollboxes are only really effective when few items overflow - hence the need for these menus in the first place).</description>

      <title>Options for browser.tabs.closeButtons in the preferences UI</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322) Build Identifier: I have read many people complain about how Firefox 2 has close buttons on each tab rather than at the far right ala Firefox 1.x. Of course, there is the browser.tabs.closeButtons option in about:config however this option takes an integer and is quite inconvenient for people not used to about:config. I reckon it would be a good idea to include a set of options in the preferences UI enabling people to change this option without hassle. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Go to the preferences. 2. There is no option to change tab close button behaviour. Actual Results: Users must go to about:config to change this. Expected Results: Users should have an option in the preferences UI.</description>

      <title>allow context-menu searching (for selected text) using installed search engines</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.4) Gecko/20060508 Firefox/1.5.0.4 Build Identifier: Currently, when there is a text selection, the user can right-click and 'Search Web for &lt;text&gt;'. This is very handy -- but why limit this to Google searching? Very often I want to search Answers.com, or perhaps Wikipedia, with some on-screen text. Right now I have their search engines installed, and so I can copy the text, focus the search bar, select the relevant engine, paste the text, and press [enter]. This is quite a lot of effort though. How about allowing the user to invoke, via the context menu, any installed search engine with the selected text, as Opera does? See attached screenshot. Bonus points for allowing this to work when there is no selection as well, allowing the user to search for a right-clicked word. For example, if the user right-clicks the on-screen word "burlesque", and the user has no text selection, offer options to search for the word "burlesque" with all installed search engines.

This has two major benefits: 1. It's very handy, especially for looking up definitions. 2. It makes 'Search &lt;active search engine&gt; for &lt;selected text&gt;' more discoverable: "Every time I right-click it offers to search for the right-clicked word. Hmm, I wonder if it works for phrases too. Maybe if I make a selection first..." Reproducible: Always</description>

Firefox, very kindly, stores form data, and passwords for websites. When entering password data, could firefox remember the fingerprint of the certificate of the site for which that data is being entered. On a phishing attempt, firefox would check through its list and note that the user is entering the same username and password as has previously been used, but to a different certificate. A popup explaining what's happening would then say if they are simply, say, creating a new account with the same username and password, then its probably not a phishing attempt (and that data would be added to the list for checking next time), if it isn't a creation then it is almost certainly phishing. My apologies if posting this suggestion is an abuse of the bug system. Reproducible: Always</description>

All these changes are confusing when we are switching between the tabs and don't want to change order. Also this behaviour isn't concurrent with all OSs, it's a gtk feature (we don't see this on Win32). See bug #307184 for more information. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open up three or more tabs 2. Switch between tabs fast 3. Notice the dragging icon and the cursor change Actual Results: Visual changes that confuse the user Expected Results: One visual change indicating where the tab should go when dragging occurs, no visual change when switching between the tabs See bug #307184</description>

I need it because I browse RSS using www.netvibes.com So I can browse RSS anywhere ( with ;-) or without ;-( Firefox ) The only way I found (when the RSS icon is not present in the web page but when it is only present in the right part of the url bar) is to click on the RSS icon and to add the RSS stream in the bookmark. Then I right click in the bookmark on this live bookmark to get its property. So I can get the url of this RSS stream. I suggest two things 1) when I left-click on the RSS icon the "add a live bookmark" page appear The url of the RSS should be present on this window (I should be able to copy it... but not modify it) This could appear on top of the window (before the name of the live bookmark and the directories) 2) when I right-click on the RSS icon the following contextual menu should appear - add a live bookmark (same as left-click) - copy the RSS url in the copyboard - name of the first RSS stream - name of others RSS streams - ...

      <description>Actually, the spellchecker is slow (bug 340326). But even if it were running at the speed of light, I still don't want to see all these red lines underlying patches I'm reviewing. It simply doesn't make sense! I know I can disable it on a per textarea basis, but I want a global pref to disable it all the time and for all pages (I already disabled it for Thunderbird). You can have it turned on by default but please let me disable it if I want to. Hidden prefs are not very friendly.</description>

      <title>Search keyword suggestion</title>

Perhaps the context menu option should be reworded, or a tooltip added, or the Add Bookmark window renamed (in that case), to make it easier to comprehend. As it is, it seems like a failed bookmark thing that adds itself to the Bookmarks menu and seems to search for nothing. My suggestion is to change this so that it behaves more like the Search Engine Wizard extension. Instead of a mysterious bookmark, it could add an actual search plugin. This would be easier to figure out, we wouldn't have an unuseable bookmark sitting in the Bookmarks menu, and it would be very cool! Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Find a nitwit such as myself. 2. Get them to right click a search form field. 3. See how long it takes them to figure out how it works. Expected Results: Search engine should have been added to the options in the Search Box.</description>

So, I have nothing against the current bother of having to add microsummary plugins. However, I have an asthetic suggestion: Could the options in the Bookmarks menu be given two lines, with a title on one line and a description/microsummary on the other? It may look knid of nice, and easier to organize, when bookmarks are more pleasantly spaced out. I'm finding microsummaries a bit difficult to appreciate as it is, since the summaries are quite small and have to actually contain the name of the page that they link to as well. If multiline bookmarks won't go over well, how about tooltips that show the summary/title of a bookmark? Reproducible: Always</description>

This is intended to reduce the likelihood of ordinary keyboard-sniffing software getting at the most valuable data. While it's unlikely to be anything close to a complete solution to the problem, it sounds like a simple, low-cost enhancement. This could occur automatically whenever a &lt;input type=password ...&gt; field gets focus, plus for any other explicit password prompts hard-coded into the gui. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Monitor X events of firefox window from an external process like xev Actual Results: 2.

      <description>Consider this situation: 1. User types a long post into a text area on a forum, which disallows guest posting. 2. For whatever reason Firefox crashes 3. When user restarts Firefox his session on that forum is expired, and since the forum disallows guest posting, the loaded page doesn't have a textarea in it. [Alternatively, the page with the textarea is on a page loaded from post-data] 4. User logs into the forum again, but the post he typed is gone. 5. User is frustrated and tells himself once again to never write long posts in Firefox. (User may be savvy enough to restore the lost text from sessionstore.bak, but I wasn't the several times it happened to me.) Session store should provide a user-visible way to restore the typed text easily. It could be implemented as a notificationbox on the affected tabs. Bonus points for letting user re-login and filling the form - once a sufficiently similar page is loaded into the tab - from the session store data.</description>

But from time to time it may helpful to get the information about files stored in the cache on a more user-friendly way, for example in a table form with the possibility to sort the different columns like key, fetch count, modification date or filename. This may very helpful in the case of extracting files from the cache. Another example is to delete single files (for example large ones) from the cache to keep the rest of the cache as it is and free up the storage. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.about:cache 2. 3. Actual Results: The files in the cache. Expected Results: The files in the cache are shown in a not very user-friendly way. There is a extension available under http://park2.wakwak.com/~benki/cacheviewer.html which creates a useful list in an external window.</description>

Using 'Add a Keyword for this Search...' does ask for a keyword, but not a description. To add any of this missing information, the user must add the bookmark and then go to the bookmark's properties. The Add Bookmark dialog should be more like the Bookmark Properties dialog.

      <title>[rfe] tab preview from all tabs menupopup</title>
      <description>[rfe] tab preview from all tabs menupopup this comes from john, see https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=343251#c100 "How about showing a preview of tabs as the user hovers over them, especially as some sites have the same title for all their pages. Temporarily switching to it would probably be too confusing, but a picture of it could be shown over the current tab. To prevent this from slowing down the UI, you would only show it if the user hovers over a menuitem for a little while, like a tooltip. Bonus marks for translucency ;) Presumeably only P3." I chatted with vlad about this, and he seemed interested in doing this (using canvas / drawWindow() in addition to vlad, michael.wu (of Reveal fame) seems like someone who knows a thing or two about this.</description>

This becomes a problem if the character set is specified only in the HTTP header, but not using the META element, e.g. &lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"&gt; Ideally, all applicable HTTP headers should be transformed to their http-equiv in HTML head section. This may be a duplicate of bug 125504. But since I'm talking about Firefox, not the deprecated Mozilla Suite, I now file a new bug here. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. View a HTML document encoded in character set other than the default character set of HTML documents (Western, ISO-8859-1). Make sure it doesn't use &lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type"&gt; 2. Save the HTML document using context menus (File menu or right-click menu). 3. Open the HTML document downloaded Actual Results: HTML viewed in wrong character set.

When i open the Bookmarks Manager and enter a search string in the Search field: Then I get a list of matches. I do not find a way to see the path in the bookmarks folder to the returned elements (bookmarks). Is there a way to see this from the bookmarks manager? If not could some developer make this possible? I have thousands of elements in the bookmarks manager. It is not easy to remember which subfolder a specific element (link) was put within the bookmarks folder. It would help me a lot if I could do the following: When I want to add a new bookmark and I do not know (remember) what folder within the bookmarks I should put it, then I would do a search in the Bookmarks Manager, and get the full path within the bookmarks folder of selected element in the result list. Then I could easily put the link where it belongs. Have I missed something.... is this possible now, or.... Regards Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. See details. Expected Results: Be able to get the path within the bookmarks folder for any of the bookmarks returned from a search in the Bookmarks Manager. I would like to be able to rightclick one of the returned elements from a search and then pick: "Show path" or similar from the context menu. This could easily be solved in 100 different ways. I'm sure a developer will find a nice one.</description>

Likewise, when I add/change/delete to bookmakrs on my own computer, then I would like my bookmarks on the www to be updated automagically. I belive this would be a nice feature for people that are travelling a lot. Today, I would have to: First remember to export my bookmarks to my email. Then I would have to import the bookmarks to the borrowed computer. Then I would have to remember to export the bookmarks to my email again, from the borrowed computer. Then I would have to remember to import the new bookmarks from my email. Not a very easy task. If Firefox cannot provide an online storage place for the bookmarks then Firefox and Google (or some other) might want to do this together. I belive google or some other www company would offer this storage for free as long as they could display adds in the process of syncing the bookmarks between the www and current computer....

As far as I can tell, that bug's about adding 'Recently Closed Tabs' to the main menu -- while this is about adding 'Undo Close Tab'.] 'Undo Close Tab' should be added to the history menu, above 'Recently Closed Tabs'. Rationale: 1. This would make the keyboard shortcut more discoverable (see bug 344736). 2. It's inconsistent UI to have 'Undo Close Tab' on the tab-bar context menu only, which I believe is the case currently. 3. When the tab bar is hidden, there's no way of accessing 'Undo Close Tab'. 'Recently Closed Tabs' is accessible, sure, but that's less convenient (requires navigating an extra sub-menu and, often, making a choice between multiple items). Reproducible: Always</description>

That feature is very nice but nearly indiscoverable for the average Joe. Also, I've been following the development of firefox 2.0 quite closely, including the microsummary, yet I really had to struggle to find out how to add a microsummary (i.e. a textbox becomes a dropbox when microsummaries are found) on a webpage I _knew_ would have one. A nice UI interface that indicates a microsummary that also shortcuts to the 'add bookmark...' dialog already using that mc would help a lot promoting that feature. Case study: - I'm viewing a site and would enjoy the microsummary feature offered but since I moved my bookmarking system to de.li.cio.us, I won't ever see the dropbox in the 'add bookmark...' dialog and miss it.

Please fix this error in judgement on Mozilla's part. It's really rediculous. I OUGHT to be able to allow my site visitors to do this by now. It's not exactly 1950, you know. Seriousely, this is a SIMPLE and BASIC function in all other browsers on the planet. I LOVE Firefox! Why this let down? WHY??? If there IS a fix to this, please KINDLY leave that fix somewhere on your site where a person can find it through a search engine, ok? I've just wasted like 3 hours looking for that fix, and it's just nowhere to be found. Reproducible: Always Actual Results: Page reloads at best. I've tried tons of variations on the javascript:document.setHomePage() code, and so far, no luck. Expected Results: Well, I expected to easily be able to find a simple JavaScript code that follows the DOM, that I could easily hard-code into my web site, which would create a link users could click on. Such a link would open their Firefox Options to the General tab and paste the url (either current or hard-coded) into the Home Page URL bar. After a visitor would use this link and have this action performed, all they would have to do is click on "OK" and that would be it. How hard should that be, really? Please, just make Firefox work with IE's JavaScript that's already tried and true, ok? It really stinks that you guys didn't already do this. It just falls into the "duh" catagory of life.</description>

This has been discussed at length in Bug 343251. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open enough tabs to implement "overflow" 2. click the "all tabs" button Actual Results: A list of tabs is provided with the active tab in bold. Expected Results: A list of tabs is provided providing feedback of both the active tab and visible tabs. There have been several ideas introduced including highlighting the background of the visible tabs and adding a check or bullet next to the active tab. Each of these has had their negative points brought to light including: 1. The visible tabs background highlight might interfere with the selection highlight. 2. What should the threshold be for turning on the background highlighting? 3. The addition of a check or bullet to the front of the menu item takes up vertical space for all menu-items. I noticed Google groups has implemented a system in their post sidebar which indicates both the selected post and the range of posts visible on the current screen. This is done without background highlighting, without a check or bullet, and only taking 6 pts of vertical space. There are thin vertical bars which indicate the visible messages, and an arrow-head indicating the selected message. I think a system similar to this would effectively implement/improve user-feedback for the both the visible and active tabs without the negative points of the other options brought to light in bug 343251.

      <title>View Installed Plug-ins</title>
      <description>Right now there's no easy way to know what plug-ins are installed in Firefox other than typing in about:plugins which no one in the real world knows about. About Plug-ins used to be a link under the Help Menu. I don't believe it belongs there. The best place is probably Add-ons manager. The other issue w/ the current about:plugins page is that it's sorted by file. It should be sorted by plug-in. (Add-ons manager really should manage plug-ins as well, displaying installed plug-ins, associate mime types, display information - desc plus version, and allow for uninstall.)</description>

Next time I see that section again, I can just click on the note to see what I had scribbled. Thanks Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2.NA 3.</description>

      <title>Place both tab scroll arrows next to "all tabs" button</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1b1) Gecko/20060725 BonEcho/2.0b1 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1b1) Gecko/20060725 BonEcho/2.0b1 With the addition of the "All Tabs" menu and the choice to have it always available, we have made this area of the tab bar the "default" spot for tab manipulation. The user will quickly become accustomed to moving to this spot. When we go into "overflow", we add two scroll arrows. One of the scroll arrows is currently next to the "All Tabs" menu, the other is at the opposite end of the tab bar. It would be better if both arrows were next to the "all tabs" menu. Two of the three controls are in this area already when in "overflow", and all of the controls are in this area under normal conditions. The control that is missing is as far away from the "default" spot as possible. There was recently a change in the find bar to move the close button for exactly this reason. This change would fix the issue with clipping tabs on the opposite side of the tab bar and the issue with the far arrow button not extending to the edge. The change could also provide a larger "window" for actual tabs since there would not need to be as much padding on the controls. Reproducible: Always</description>

      <title>Hitting shortcut to focus the content window so arrow keys scroll the page.[navigation quick switch]</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.0.4) Gecko/20060608 Ubuntu/dapper-security Firefox/1.5.0.4 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.0.4) Gecko/20060608 Ubuntu/dapper-security Firefox/1.5.0.4 This is a feature request, mostly usefull for people who prefer keyboard to the mouse. I would like a shortcut that would : a) focus the webpage no matter what I am doing. b) If hit again while the webpage is focused, it would bring the webpage back to its original position and put the cursor back into whereever it was, like a form field for example. This could also server as a kind of reset-everything-you're-doing-and-fall-back-to-a-safe-place. Example 1 (filling forms): When filling in forms in long pages and I want to page-up to re-read something I have to either Tab myself to death until I perceive the subtle focusing hints on the page or I have to click somewhere in the page to give it focus. Hitting 'shortcut' could do just that. If hit again I'm back to entering text. Example 2 (the location bar): Sometimes I focus the location bar just to give up typing something because I realize I missed something in the bottom on the page. So I want to read the rest and it would be just great to immediately focus the page and start scrolling with the keyboard. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.Start filing a bug in bugzilla.mozilla.org 2.when in the "steps to reproduce" field try using your keyboard to go to the top of the page. 3.count how many keystrokes it took you (no mouse cheating) Actual Results: 5 keystrokes for me. Expected Results: Alwasys 2 keystrokes. 1. Esc-Esc to focus page 2. Ctrl-Home to go up. And this would be independent of the web page.</description>

      <title>Provide a browser.tabs.tabMaxWidth</title>

Previously, I always used a userChrome.css for a tab fixed width. Without that, the tabs fill up the width of the tab strip which is inconvenient for various reasons. e.g. you need to chase close buttons which have different distances. And another reason is that there is no space to doubleclick on the tab strip when you have 6 tabs open. In the latest test version of BonEcho however, the userChrome code doesn't work anymore. I tried extensions like TabControl, but it also overlays other tab functions that are better in BonEcho. So please provide a pref to set a max width, or change the code so that the userChrome works again. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open tabs one by one Actual Results: They fill up the tab strip Expected Results: Every tab should have the same size that I can specify in about:config</description>

      <title>In the search bar, scrolling the mouse wheel should switch the engine</title>
      <description>(This is based on StringCheesian's proposal on f.m.o.) 1. This would be very handy for switching the engine for 'Search &lt;selected engine&gt; for &lt;selected text&gt;' searches (see bug 203959). 2. This would probably be more discoverable and more memorable than Ctrl+Up/Ctrl+Down -- and perhaps more convenient as well, for those who focus the search bar with the mouse (rather than using Ctrl+K). Perhaps this would apply only to the engine icon itself.</description>

      <title>Add a "Save Image as..." entry to the context menu for &lt;canvas&gt;</title>
      <description>[I hope this is the correct component. I didn't put it in Core &gt; Layout: Canvas because there should be a bug there about the backend for this, and I'm fairly sure there is, and the point is that the functionality actually gets exposed to the user] Currently, a &lt;canvas&gt; element has roughly the same context menu as a blank area in the page. That's fairly suboptimal, in my opinion. It would be nice if we had some of the options you have on a normal &lt;img&gt; element, such as saving. Linking to it is probably hard or impossible (though perhaps one could generate a data URI? Not sure if there's a way to recreate everything done to a canvas after the fact), but being able to save it would be useful.</description>

But the downside is: they take up a lot of screenspace the 3rd is absolutly essential the 2nd you need and the first should be there, but the empty space is completely unnescesary. Here we could compensate for the lost space due to the bookmarktoolbar and tab bar by [b]integrating[/b]or combining the menubar and the blue top bar with the firefox icon This wil give you another centimeter (approx. 35cm2)of screenspace, which in my opinion is most essential for a webbrowser.

Internet Explorer, on the other hand, is perfectly capable of doing this. This site, http://www.quiznos.com/storefinder/results.aspx?CountryID=1&amp;StateID=61&amp;City=Vienna&amp;Zip=&amp;Proximity=10, is just one of the numerous sites that has an address on multiple lines. When I highlight " 320 Maple Ave W Vienna, VA 22180 " and copy it to paste it into Google Maps in another tab, the text shown is only the first line. This is extremely infuriating since it takes multiple times just to copy an address. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Go to any site. For example, go to a store and find its location. A sample is provided at http://www.quiznos.com/storefinder/results.aspx?CountryID=1&amp;StateID=61&amp;City=Vienna&amp;Zip=&amp;Proximity=10 2. Highlight and copy the address (two lines of text). 3. Go to Microsoft Word or any text field on the internet (in Firefox, of course) and paste. Actual Results: After performing these steps, the same problem still occured - in that only the first line of text was copied. Expected Results: Firefox should have copied the full address (both lines of text). This works in internet explorer</description>

      <title>Middle-clicking on left side of tab should switch focus to the tab on the left after closing the current one</title>
      <description>* Open three tabs and focus the one in the middle * Middle-click on a spot near the left edge of the current tab * Focus should switch to the left tab when the middle tab closes This is not my idea but I discovered the function in the Optimoz Tweaks extension. It is a handy function that can save an extra mouse movement. The extension itself is old and a bit buggy; e.g. it makes the All Tabs menu extremely short as a side-effect. I think it would be something nice to build in.</description>

The description needs to point out that this is a tool for developers. Suggestion: "Dom Inspector A web developer tool for investigating the structure of a window or web page" Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Run firefox-2.0b1.en-US.win32.installer.exe 2. Select Custom option Actual Results: Explanation of the Dom Inspector which doesn't indicate to my grandma that this is for web developers only. Expected Results: Something that indicates that this is a tool for web developers</description>

Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.. 2.. 3.. Actual Results: . Expected Results: . We should intergrate a "Refresh All" in the content menu when rightclicking on a live bookmark or the live bookmarks folder. Its get to be a pain when some bookmarks will not load and you have to individually reload each live bookmark. What a pain when you have 20 plus bookmarks. I believe this should be added to firefox 2 before it ships. Should I take this myself(have a few months on coding, currently in college) or would someone take this enhancement?</description>

      <title>Allow extensions to add searchplugins at an arbitrary position in the list</title>
      <description>Currently extensions can add a searchplugin at the top of the list by setting the browser.search.order.1 pref. This is a little unfortunate because it doesn't "push down" the defaults by one. We can fix this by using a prefbranch: pref("browser.search.order.extra.seznam", "Seznam"); This will push Seznam to the top of the list.</description>

      <title>There should be UI for setting dom.max_script_run_time</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.0.6) Gecko/20060804 Firefox/1.5.0.6 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.0.6) Gecko/20060804 Firefox/1.5.0.6 Details: see below. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open "Edit -&gt; Preferences" (or "Tools -&gt; Options") menu 2. Open the various tabs and submenus, looking for the timeout delay before a script is declared "unresponsive". Actual Results: Preference in question is nowhere to be found. Expected Results: Preference should be found somewhere among the "Preferences", not only as a "needle in the haystack" under about:config Additional information: The time delay before a script is declared "unresponsive" and causes a popup message is currently fixed at 5 seconds, and can only be modified by means of about:config (or user.js). This 5-second delay is in many cases too short: after noticing that, in most cases, clicking "Continue" allowed (in Firefox) the page to open normally, or (in Thunderbird) the compose window for the "reply to all" email to open normally, with no adverse effects, I went on a hunt for where that timeout was defined. After a little trial-and-error, I have set dom.max_script_run_time to 30 seconds in Firefox and to 15 in Thunderbird; the result is much more satisfactory for me, with my kind of browsing and my set of installed extensions. I realise that the ideal value cannot be determined once and for all, for all users of Firefox, Thunderbird, Camino and the Mozilla Suite; therefore I believe that users should be able to set this timeout easily to whatever value they prefer, without having to resort to a needle-in-the-haystack search in about:config. This is all the more needed because, if and when the popup opens, the corresponding tab becomes focused, which can be annoying if the user was in the process of clicking on a link or a button.</description>

      <title>we need a "New Tab" button on the tab bar [tabbar, tab-bar] in the default UI</title>

I think it makes sense to have it on the tab bar, rather than the navigation toolbar. The "New Tab Button on Tab Bar" extension (https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1456/) does a good job of this I think. Opera has the actual text "New Tab" on the button, but I don't think that's necessary and mostly wastes precious space. New users won't know the key-combinations (CTRL + T) and other shortcuts (e.g. double clicking a blank area of the tab bar) every power user uses, to open a new tab they gotta go through the File menu or, if they know how and are bothered enough, add the New Tab button to the navigation toolbar. I also think the tab bar should always be displayed by defualt, but there's no point in that unless/until this bug is fixed. (I think it's kinda likely that this bug is a dupe, but I searched for a good while and found nothing) Reproducible: Always</description>

This impacts theme authors who apply styling changes to part of the toolbar as well as, possibly, end users who apply accessibility-related changes to their browser appearance through userChrome.css or accessibility extensions. Any one of the following would serve: window#main-window[fullscreenmode="true"] toolbox#navigator-toolbox[fullscreenmode="true"] or something along those lines. Reproducible: Always</description>

Simply changing the font there does not apply because by default, FireFox has the Advanced option of "Allow pages to choose their own font instead of the ones I listed above. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: * Change your font setting to Comic Sans MS * Click "OK" Actual Results: The font setting is not applied until the Advanced option is unticked. Expected Results: The end-user should be able to change the font straight from the userprefs menu for Content. I am not even sure if this is intended behavior because I've never actually attempted to do this before. I just feel the userprefs dialog for Content is a bit deceptive because it cannot actually change the font settings until the option through "Advanced" is unticked. Having this option under content or negating it somehow would make it easier for people to customize the font the browser uses.</description>

This also allows better visibility to this feature. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open firefox. Type some non-URL keywords. For example "New York Times" 2.

      <title>Warning user when they visit badware/malware sites</title>
      <description>Prompted from http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=449050 Currently firefox supports anti-phishing. That is to say, people are warned if they visit a site that is likely to try and scam them (of money, of their personal data, etc.) What about another similar feature, maybe called 'Safer-browsing' which warns users if they are visiting a site which is likely to contain malware/badware. Google seem to be providing such a feature for their search results: - http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/5251742.stm If firefox could use such a list, it would protect its users even more. Of course there are some points to consider: 1) If firefox did use such a list, what would happen if a user clicked on a malware site from a google search. Would google, then firefox, warn them of this? Two warnings are unnecessary 2) How long is the list of sites that contain badware. I would expect it to be longer than the anti-phishing list, but maybe not. 3) Would google (or other providers) be willing to give this information out for this purpose? 4) Should the user have to discriminate between anti-phishing, and safer-browsing. That is to say, should there be a new set of options for "Safer browsing" (anti-badware), or should the anti-badware list just be merged into the anti-phishing list, and controlled from one set of options. Or to put it another way, would an end-user want to be protected from phishing but not from badware, and vica versa?</description>

So when I have two Firefox window (both with any number of tabs), I would be able to drag&amp;grop one window (or just tabs, depending on which one I grab) to the other, so the dragged tab/window would disappear from its previous location, and new tabs would appear in the destination firefox-window.

      <title>Tab strip should be a toolbar instead</title>
      <description>From bug 347844 comment 7: "The tab strip should become the 'Tab Toolbar' and be toggleable on and off, and customizable, in the same way other toolbars are. Currently it would have a large flexible 'Tabs' section, and an 'All Tabs' button at the end. Maybe 'New Tab', 'Close Tab', etc. buttons qould be other choices in the menu o' buttons of what could go here." This allows a lot of things: (1) Addition of a 1.0/1.5-style "close tab" button without a pref (2) Placement of the New Tab button (or an "undo close tab" button) on the tab strip itself (3) Removal of the All Tabs menu (4) Permanent hiding of the tab strip ...all without touching preferences, in a way that very much matches user expectations from the other toolbars. We can still style the tab strip the same way, and we can still auto-hide it (under a pref) the same way.</description>

      <title>Frames Context menu should show Frame menu instead of page menu items</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; de; rv:1.8.0.2) Gecko/20060308 Firefox/1.5.0.2 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; de; rv:1.8.0.2) Gecko/20060308 Firefox/1.5.0.2 When using "Show page source" or "Show page information" on sites using frames it's very awkward to find the frame related "Show page source" and "Show page information" menu items hidden within a sub menu. Comparing the frequency on how often "Show page source" or "Show page information" are used on inner and outer frames, respectively (99.9% : 0.1%), it would be much more efficient to have the "Current Frame" submenu replaced with an "Outer Frame" (or "Window") submenu and to swap functionality of the corresponding menu items accordingly. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open a Frames based webpage 2. Right click into any of the frames Actual Results: Selecting context menu item "Show page source" shows the source of the outermost frame (or "top" window object), whereas opening the "Current Frame" submenu and then selecting the context menu item "Show page source" shows the source of the currently active frame (or "self" window object). Expected Results: Selecting context menu item "Show page source" should show the source of the currently active frame (or "self" window object), whereas opening the "Outer Frame" submenu and then selecting the context menu item "Show page source" should show the source of the outermost frame (or "top" window object). Possible solution: Just rename the sub menu and exchange event handlers, both in the context menu and the main menu as well.</description>

I love Firefox, but I hate the GTK file dialog. I found a great fix that allows you to replace the GTK dialog with another (XUL??) dialog that works (for me) much better here: http://konquefox.free.fr/index.html#trick_filepicker It'd be great if this was exposed on the preferences dialog or at least if there were an extension that did this. As it stands even KDE users must live with the Gnome dialog unless they do a lot of research and then they have to manually edit a config file. Reproducible: Always</description>

Actual Results: the modal dialog prompted and the selected tab changes without apparent notice.

It looks more out of place with the new visual refresh theme. Recommend considering the adoption of more modern looking tabs similar to those in Camino 1.x. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open Preference Menu for Firefox 2. Click on advanced Actual Results: OS X 10.2 style tabs for General, Network Update, Encryption tab selection are displayed. These are similar to the tabs in very old builds of camino or the mozilla suite. Expected Results: OS X 10.4 style tabs for General, Network Update, Encryption tab selection are displayed. These are similar to the tabs in camino's preference panel. Camino once used similar style tabs and switched over to more modern looking tabs. With all the effort being placed on the great looking new theme, it may be worth reconsidering redoing this tab implementation.</description>

Type "about:" in the location bar. 2. Hit Enter. 3. (The Firefox "about:" page, with the nice big Fox logo, is now displayed.) Actual Results: There is no distinctive favicon on the corresponding tab. Expected Results: I suggest that there be one: for instance, the Firefox logo. Additional info: When using many tabs (several tens), I usually group tabs by separating them with an "about:" tab. This is both nice (the tab content is pleasing when opening it as "the next tab in sequence") and economical (no modem access is required). It would IMHO be even nicer if, rather than showing a "blank paper sheet", the favicon (the only visible thing when tabs are many and narrow) would display, let's say, the Firefox logo.</description>

The exact way to integrate this information with Firefox's browser chrome may still be under debate, but it would be nice to recognize when an extended validation certificate is encountered and provide the user with some way to know that an extended validation site has occurred. On the "Security" tab of "Page Info" would be a good place to start. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Install Microsoft Testing Root Certificate Authority certificate (http://crypto.stanford.edu/~collinj/testingroot.cer) 3. Visit https://www.woodgrovebank.com/ Actual Results: Address bar turns yellow with lock icon. Nothing particularly unusual is shown if you click on the lock icon. Expected Results: Address bar turns green (maybe) and organization name (and possibly CA identity) from certificate is displayed. Or, if that's too radical of a change, at least show some information about the fact that extended validation is present when you click the lock icon. You can also get the Microsoft Testing Root Certificate Authority certificate here: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=0742AE7E-6E7F-47D3-8327-E20D94AF2794&amp;displaylang=en If you install it using that tool, you'll need to export it to Firefox using the certificates snap-in in the Microsoft Management Console (C:\WINDOWS\system32\mmc.exe).

Use Most-Recently Used list to keep track of user tab selection changes. If user was viewing tab 2 and he then switches to tab 5 and closes tab 5, then tab 2 should become the current tab. Also, use the same MRU list to cycle through the tabs forward or backward by using the Control-Tab and Shift-Control-Tab keys. This allow the user to cycle between two or three tabs that are not adjacent to each other. Note: cycling through the tabs using these key combinations should not change the relative order of tabs in the MRU list, just changes the currently displayed tab. Reproducible: Always</description>

      <title>[Mac] Add site icons / favicons to bookmarks toolbar buttons</title>
      <description>Since a theme refresh is being explored for Firefox 2, I thought this was worth revisiting. I've created a patch to add icons to the bookmarks toolbar, and personally I think it looks much better with them. Maybe you guys will disagree. I think the icons break up what is otherwise a long bar of grey text, and make the individual button regions more defined. They're also practical, as they make an easier visual target of the button you're after. The only downside is they take up a little more room on the toolbar. Comparison screenshots follow, then a patch.</description>

This is not a request for special SVG context menu items (like zoom and pan) though that would be nice. This is just a request that extension authors can find when the user has clicked on SVG content (either inline or as a reference). This will be very useful for SVG specific menu items like zooming, panning, and rotating. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Build an extension 2. try to use the context menu to find out if the user clicked on SVG content. 3. fail. Actual Results: no indication of presence of SVG Expected Results: having available a boolean onSVG value in the context menu interface that reports the presence of SVG In http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/browser/base/content/browser.js , there should be code something like this pseudocode: function nsContextMenu( xulMenu ) { ... this.onSVG = false; } nsContextMenu.prototype = { ... setTarget : function ( node, rangeParent, rangeOffset ) { ... // See if the user clicked on SVG const NS_SVG = "http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"; if ((this.target.parentNode.namespaceURI == NS_SVG) || (this.target.namespaceURI == NS_SVG)) this.onSVG = true; } }</description>

      <title>Educate users about RSS/Atom feeds and Live Bookmarks</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1b1) Gecko/20060815 BonEcho/2.0b1 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1b1) Gecko/20060815 BonEcho/2.0b1 IMHO, the first time that a user visits a site with a RSS/Atom feed, Firefox should educate them about what "feeds" are, and how "Live Bookmarks" works. Here's a mock up notification dialog: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- RSS/Atom feed(s) detected (number of feeds detected) |X| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Whether it’s news from CNN and the BBC, or posts on your friend’s blog, the Web is updated continually. Firefox’s Live Bookmarks feature automatically keeps track of these updates for you, so you always know when new content has been added to your favorite sites. With Live Bookmarks, the content comes to you. Instead of constantly checking Web pages for changes and additions, a Live Bookmark delivers updates from a RSS/Atom feed to you as soon as they are available. You can also choose to use your own RSS/Atom reader such as Google Reader, Bloglines, or My Yahoo. When RSS or Atom feeds are available, a orange RSS icon will appear in the Location Bar like this: [screenshot of location bar with RSS icon] Click on the orange RSS icon there to view and subscribed to the available feeds. See Help topic for details. [OK] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Reproducible: Always</description>

      <title>fullscreen mode displays strage white and grey line on top of the page</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.8.0.6) Gecko/20060728 Firefox/1.5.0.6 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.8.0.6) Gecko/20060728 Firefox/1.5.0.6 If you enter the fullscreen mode [F11] you will see a strange white and a grey line on the top of your screen. I prepared a page where you can see nothing but a picture. 800 pixel width, 600 pixel height. It's completly black, but there is a red line on the bottom of the picture, it's 1 pixel in height. The picture starts on the most left and on the most uppest pixel of the screen (or at least it should if firefox would do what the source code tells him to do). So you should see everything black, but the red line on the bottom of your screen if your screen resolution is 800x600. Instead, you see a white and a grey line on the top of the screen but not the red line on the bottom. you can see the red line, if you scroll down with your mouse wheel. No you can't use the scrollbars, they are disabled in the source code, so that they don't waste space and a picture of 800x600 can be displayed if your screen resolution is also 800x600. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. go to http://www.ontheserver.de/temp/Mozilla/Firefox/fullscreen 2. change your screen resolution to 800x600 3. press [F11] to enter the fullscreen mode in firefox 4. don't see the red line at the bottom but the white and grey at the top Actual Results: you see a grey and a white line on the top of the screen. Expected Results: The white and the grey line shouldn't be there. But you should see the red line on the bottom of the screen. I am using the default theme. Maybe it has something to do with the theme. Firefox doesn't provide 800x600 pixels in fullscreen mode, only 800x598.</description>

Probably the most unintrusive way is to expand the "Add Bookmark" dialog and show some educational content inside it. "Discoverability" is key because there's not really a point of having a new feature when a user doesn't even know it's there to use. Reproducible: Always</description>

      <title>Request: Hide mouse cursor while using the keyboard to scroll or type</title>

As soon as you move the mouse, it can come back. For a comparison, I think Safari might do this. Thanks (Sorry if this is a duplicate, I expected to find a similar request in bugzilla but nothing was found for "hide cursor scroll" in all Firefox components, OPEN or CLOSED...)

Then, if a user right clicks on a folder containing one or more live titles, there should be a "Reload All Live Titles" in the context menu that when clicked reloads all the Live Titles in the folder. Reproducible: Always Actual Results: User has to manually reload Live Titles one by one. Expected Results: User can do this: (a): right click on a live title, see "Reload all Live Titles", click it, and all live titles are reloaded. (b): right click on a folder containing one or more live titles, see "Reload all Live Titles", click it, and all live titles in the corresponding folder are reloaded.</description>

      <title>Local copies of config files ignored and hence preferences overwritten during product update</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.0.6) Gecko/20060728 Firefox/1.5.0.6 (Debian-1.5.dfsg+1.5.0.6-2) Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.0.6) Gecko/20060728 Firefox/1.5.0.6 (Debian-1.5.dfsg+1.5.0.6-2) I have made some changes to a system-wide config file - nsFilePicker.js but this bug applies to any file within /usr/lib/firefox/components (in Debian). Whenever I update Firefox these files are overwritten and my changes lost - fair enough they are system-wide after all. To avoid this I have placed a copy of the file (including the changes) in my local ~/firefox/&lt;profile&gt;/components directory - as is the norm when making user specific config changes. This file should be detected and used overriding the system-wide ones but it is not. Thus each time I update Firefox I must make those changes again or copy a backup version of my changed file over the freshly installed one - this is not a good way to do things! Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Copy /usr/lib/firefox/components/nsFilePicker.js to ~/firefox/&lt;profile&gt;/components/nsFilePicker 2. Make some changes in the local copy 3. Start Firefox Actual Results: Changes in local file are ignored but make those changes in the usr/lib/firefox/.. copy and they are obeyed. Note: when making changes to nsFilePicker you need to refresh the Extensions list by adding, removing or updating an extension and then restarting Firefox. This is done in both cases and the changes in the local file are still ignored. Expected Results: The local config changes should be obeyed. The reason I am making the changes is to make firefox stop using it's own file/print dialogs and get it to use my preferred window manager ones (in my case the KDE dialogs). So what I am really after is a local config change that allows me to set which dialogs to use. Changing nsFilePicker.js is a workaround and I'm happy with it but the local copy being ignored is a pain as I have to repeat my changes each time I update Forefox (which is quite a bit when using Debian unstable!).</description>

I was checking out this awesome highres image of Venice, Italy, and in parallell I had a Google Maps window up so that I could figure out what the streets/canals are named etc. In the Google Maps window I can drag the entire map around very conveniently but left-clicking-and-holding-while-dragging and after I had been ALT-TABing between these two for a while I realized that I was missing the same functionality for that huge image in Firefox. Using the scrollbars works but it feels very clunky. So, my feature request is: When a huge image is in it's "zoomed in" mode, enabled the user to move around using left-click-and-hold-dragging just like how Google Maps work. This will certainly be very nice to have to all kinds of images, even portaits and so on. Reproducible: Always</description>

It's to restrictive for administrators! I miss an opportunity to install an xpi (plugin) via command line like: c:\firefox&gt; firefox.exe -i plugin.xpi So it's possible wo write very easily some batch scripts to install only the neccessairy plugins for an individual user in the system. The plugins should be installable from any ressource in the network (or the internet), like this: c:\firefox&gt; firefox.exe -i http://192.168.2.50/firefox/plugins/plugin.xpi I hope you can realize such a great enhancement as soon as possible, to make it more attractive for administrators of big corporations, to distribute firefox and its plugins. Reproducible: Always Actual Results: plugins are only distributeable via a preconfigured deployment version. Expected Results: more flexibility for network administrators the unattended setup is very bad solved at the moment. Any other software installer gives this important opportunity of silent switches for a unattended setup and roll out in big networks.</description>

      <title>Drop "Copy Link Location" from mailto: link context menu</title>
      <description>If you right-click on an email link (with a "mailto:" in the href), there are a two variations of the copy command available: 1. Copy Email Address 2. Copy Link Location Copying the email address does what you would expect, putting "name@domain.com" in the clipboard. The Copy Link Location copies the contents of the "href" attribute, putting something like "mailto:name@domain.com" in the clipboard. I'm finding it a bit difficult to imagine a situation in which one would want to copy the link location for an email link. If there is something I'm missing, please let me know. The only argument I could think of for this was consistency with other links - though I'm not sure it's a strong point. Can we scrap the Copy Link Location in mailto: links? Bug #102418 covered this for the old Mozilla suite.</description>

It is currently hard-coded as a constant: "var speed = 12" in function accelerate() in /seamonkey/source/xpfe/communicator/resources/content/utilityOverlay.js (I give the exact link as of today to LXR at the URL of the bug.) I personally think 12 is too fast, and would be happy if the value were simply raised (higher numbers cause slower acceleration). Reproducible: Always bug 330069 requests a similar functionality.</description>

      <title>Tab option not great in all situations.</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.6) Gecko/20060728 Firefox/1.5.0.6 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.6) Gecko/20060728 Firefox/1.5.0.6 In Tools/Options.../Tabs, you can select "Force links that open new windows to open in a new tab", which I have selected. I think that this rule should not apply to said links in javascript popup windows because the windows are usually only large enough to display its own content. When using this tab option, any links that are meant to open new windows end up opening a new tab, which is expected, but not practical. Links like that usually open different websites, which were not meant to be viewed in a tiny popup box. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Tools/Options.../Tabs 2. Check "Force links that open new windows to open in:" and select "a new tab" 3. Open a target="_blank" link in a popup window Actual Results: New tab opens in popup window. Expected Results: I suggest that only in this situation, the link should open a new window.</description>

      <title>"Open in new window" redirect issues</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9a1) Gecko/20060826 Minefield/3.0a1 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9a1) Gecko/20060826 Minefield/3.0a1 First, the description in Options|Tabs is confusing. "New pages open in:" is confusing because new pages usually open in the same window, and this does nothing to change that behavior. The description in the help file "Open links that would open new windows in:" is much better and should replace it. An option to make such links open in the same page would be useful as well as being able to designate behavior per-site. Sites like hardocp that give a blurb for a story and then insist on opening another window for the real story on another site is a real annoyance and the motivation for this feature request. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Navigate to Options|Tabs 2. The text reads "New pages open in:" 3. There is no option to open links in the same window. 4. There is no option to select per-site behavior. Actual Results: Features do not exist. Expected Results: Features work as described.</description>

      <description>search suggestion fail over url:- Wikipedia search do not have search suggestions. So why not provide google suggestion as a fail over URL this may be a single url or a list of urls in about:config also useful case is where user search "biju kris" in google, no suggestion came but if search was in yahoo it would have shown "biju krishnan" so it will be a good idea if we could configure a list of fail over urls first firefox should check url provided in search add-on if missed, then the first URL from about:config still missed then the second URL from about:config and so on</description>

This is a frustrating UI decision for those who block cookies by default (such as myself), as I must periodically unblock a site and it is sometimes hard to find the exact address I previously blocked (e.g. ebay.com vs. search.ebay.com vs. cgi3.ebay.com). There should be a way to to a substring search on the exception list, as is already the case for set cookies. Furthermore, as a matter of consistency, it might be good to eliminate (or move over to an "advanced" section) the manual exception-setting field, as it could at first glance be perceived as a search field (yes, I know we should be reading the help text, but just looking at the dialog layout vis-a-vis the existing cookie dialog layout, the functionality could be easily confused). Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open preferences dialog. 2. Navigate to "privacy" tab. 3. Under cookies, click "exceptions" to raise the relevant dialog. Actual Results: Observe lack of search facility, and constrast with "Show cookies" dialog. Expected Results: A search/filter field should be present.</description>

In other words, in absence of specialized GUI, bookmark management was used a way to add and manage user defined search engines. Now enter management for search engines. Proposal. 1. "Add a Keyword for this Search" must add new search engine as visible in drop-down list of search engines and "Manage Search Engines" dialog. 2. "Manage Search Engines" dialog must allow user to assign a keyword for a search engine. Later on, user would use the keyword to invoke corresponding search engine directly from location input field. I hope what I have said still classifies as "common sense" and would straighten Firefox' GUI. And allow me - end-user - easily add search engines w/o any special hacks.

As you can see in the image below, the 3 tabs are in 3 different levels of contrast.(the first one is a regular tab.. the second one is with hover/mouseover and the last is the current tab.) http://img520.imageshack.us/my.php?image=ffox2b2qz7.png The current tab is the most legible/clear one and the only time I tend to look at the tabs is when I'm looking to switch to another tab and it takes too much effort to read the text in those tabs. Compare readability with the same fonts used in the bookmarks/menu toolbars. Even in the new theme concept mockups the contrast of the fonts is not affected and they look perfectly legible. http://wiki.mozilla.org/Image:Fx2-new-theme-concept-tabs.png IMO normal vs bold is good enough to differentiate between the current tab and others. maybe a leave the other tabs in the regular background color and make the current one white/bright. but there's no need to make the fonts duller. Reproducible: Always There seems to be a windows bug report that is almost similiar but the tabs don't look as bad/unreadable on the screenshots I see there as they do on my desktop. https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=350690</description>

He was wondering if it might be possible to select more than one search engine from the search bar and have the results from each one open in different tabs. I could see this implemented in one really useful way: A window that can pop up on a certain key press (or by clicking something with the mouse I suppose...) that has a search box (with default focus) and a list of search engines below with check boxes next to each. Type in your query, tab through with the keyboard to select the engines you want, then press enter (click ok). New tabs open with all the relevant searches. Would something like this maybe be possible for either FF2 or FF3? Reproducible: Always</description>

      <title>Add a Keyword for this Search should pre-select 'Quick Searches' folder in the 'Create In' dropdown, or at least give option to.</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1b2) Gecko/20060821 Firefox/2.0b2 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1b2) Gecko/20060821 Firefox/2.0b2 When a user right-clicks in a Search form on any webpage, the context menu prompts them to 'Add a Keyword for this Search'. By it's very nature, this is (according to the pre-packaged Bookmarks folder) a 'Quick Search'. Therefore, it should, by default - be placed in the 'Quick Searches' bookmarks folder. Instead, the dialog box that appears prompts the user to enter in all the info and the default location to place that bookmark is in the root of the Bookmarks folder. It's no wonder it's a little-known/little used feature of Firefox! I 'converted' a family member this week and helped him get set up on Firefox - I turn my attention away for 30 seconds and he's already deleted the 'Quick Searches' folder!! I seem to recall bringing up this issue 6months-to-a-year ago, but was told "Places is coming! Don't worry about it!". Places is not here, and as I don't know how it will handle Keywords, my suggestion may be of use anyway. (see consideration, below) Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Right-click on webpage's Search form. 2. Select "Add Keyword for this Search" from the context menu. 3. Note tha the 'Create in' location is set to (the root folder) 'Bookmarks'. A point for consideration: - Some people may move or delete the Quick Searches folder. Therefore, the simplest solution to avoid issues might be to do an 'if exist' (however that is done) and if 'Quick Searches' does not exist, prompt the user with an Alert briefly explaining that this is the suggested location. It could offer 3 choices: 1) a "Create it now?" option 2) a "Select a new location for Quick Searches folder" option, and store the new location info for future use. 3) a "allow me to always decide" option, in which case the "Bookmarks"(root) would always be pre-selected.</description>

      <title>Icons in Firefox 2.0b2 toolbar are shorter than text boxes</title>
      <description>The Firefox 2.0b2 release has changed the default icons for its toolbar. The "Go" icon, the search box engine icon, and the "Search" icon look a bit weird, i.e., they are shorted than the text boxes next to them, which make them look awkward at best. In my opinion, they need more work to match the elegant new tabs. I'll post a screenshot in a moment.</description>

I then have to cut and paste it to where I want it..or just manually post all html coding - very frustrating once I've manually typed them in they work fine!...PLEASE HELP ME! Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.you have to have an account to post there...so, you'll have to open up one..sorry about this. But, it's quite simple..at the top of the page you'll see log-in/ register/ log-out...click on the register and open an account. Then go the forum and try to post a message. 2.click on the post reply button and it will open a 'text box' go ahead and type in some text. 3.highlight the text, using curser, and then try to click on the buttons above the text box...you'll see that all html coding is placed after any text you've typed..so you get [color=#3366FF][/color][size=5][/size] I cannot get it to wrap around my text that I want changed. Actual Results: image &amp; font tags will not wrap around my text. Expected Results: It should have placed the tags around my highlighted text. I'm using the Silver skin theme.

      <title>"Remove All Sites" in Cookies exceptions should ask for confirmation.</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.0.6) Gecko/20060728 Firefox/1.5.0.6 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.0.6) Gecko/20060728 Firefox/1.5.0.6 If you press the button accidentally, you lose the list of allowed sites. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Go to Preferences → Privacy → Cookies; 2. Make sure that “Allow sites to set cookies” is unchecked; 3. Press the “Exceptions” button 4. Have some exceptions in the list 5. (Don't do if you need the exceptions!) Press the “Remove All Sites” button. Actual Results: The list is cleared, impossible to restore it (except, maybe, by killing Firefox's process before it stores the profile). Expected Results: A dialog appears to ask if I really want to clear the list. Or a button to undo the action. Same in 2.0b2.</description>

      <description>Right now, the "Downloads" window can be brought up by going to the Tools menu. In the tools menu, we have the DOM inspector, Error console, and things like that. Just like in Camino and Safari, it would make sense to have this in the Window menu. If there is no equivalent to the Window menu on other platforms, this could possibly be mac-only.</description>

Please consider that it's a behaviour that quite a lot of people find annoying (see bug 216346 and ALL its duplicates). IMHO the preference should be set to false by default (the less destructive behaviour) but since the developers think true is better, a radio button or a checkbox at least would be useful under Edit - Preferences - Tabs.

      <title>should we add a "remember my tabs" to the close confirm prompt on quit?</title>
      <description>should we add a "remember my tabs" to the close confirm prompt on quit? on quit, we march through all the windows and, if your prefs are set right, we'll prompt and warn the user that we are about to close a window with &lt;n&gt; tabs. in this scenario, the choice is: "close tabs" or "cancel". (This is good, for when closing the window). but on Quit, what about a third option: "close and remember tabs"? or maybe another way to ask for this feature is: how can I quit the browser and have it remember my windows and tabs (using session restore)?</description>

      <title>Implement pref-based search parameters</title>
      <description>For various partner builds we'd like to be able to set search parameters based on the value of a pref, rather than hardcoding the value into the searchplugin. This should use a special prefbranch so that searchplugins installed off the web don't have access to random preferences. Gavin's proposed syntax: &lt;MozParam name="fr" condition="pref" pref="yahoo-fr" /&gt; with pref("browser.search.param.yahoo-fr", "moz2"); will produce fr=moz2 as a search parameter.</description>

Press Ctrl-D to open the "Add Bookmarks" Dialog 2. 3. Actual Results: When bookmarking a page and the "Add Bookmark" dialog appears, the window automatically shows the parent "Bookmark" folder as well as the last used bookmark subfolders in which a bookmark was saved. Expected Results: From a usability perspective, it should not be a multiple-step process to view and select subfolders of the parent "Bookmarks", in which you would like to save a bookmark. Currently, you have to push the drop-down button to see all available subfolders of the parent "Bookmarks". In my opinion, all parent folders should be listed and you should be able to select any subfolder by pausing the mouse upon its parent and having that folder automatically expanded for selection This enhancement is similiar to the functionality of the main Firefox menubar where the submenus are expanded automatically if the mouse is paused upon its parent menu.</description>

When the editor process ends, Firefox would react by reinitializing the textarea with the new contents of the temporary file. This last operation could be undoable. Care must be taken for the case when the user has left the page containing the textarea at the time when the editor process ends. The user should be allowed to send more than one textarea to external editors at the same time. The Preferences would contain a field allowing the user to specify an external editor. By default, it would be the system's standard text editor, like gedit under GNOME, Notepad under Windows, etc. Reproducible: Always</description>

      <title>highlight links available in pages using the keyboard</title>
      <description>I set my preferences to not underline links (because this makes the UI ugly IMO) but sometimes it's difficult to guess where these links are in some pages (because the text is not explicit enough). So having a way as easy as Ctrl+&lt;something&gt; to highlight them would be great. This is much faster than changing prefs for this single page only. Also, I think that it may be difficult for people with visual disabilities to easily see links in some texts, so this feature would probably also be useful for them. This is the reason why I CC'ed Aaron.</description>

      <title>May wanna add hl={moz:language} to google.xml's suggest</title>
      <description>Right now, google offers to corpuses, one global, one for Japan. For 2.0, we're adding a hl=ja to a distinct google-ja.xml to select that corpus. As google adds more corpuses, adding a hl={moz:language} to the generic google.xml should improve UE for more locales. This should be developed in parallel, so that we can test the implementation on both sides. Once that works on the trunk, it might be a good idea to backport that support to the 1.8 branch, too. As the hl param really only wants the language, we'll need to add support for that to nsSearchService.js.</description>

This trail consists in an ordered list of the last pages visited on the site. It allows a user to easily access previously visited pages, without having to trawl through the browser history. The Firefox "Go" menu seems to provide similar functionality, though it seems to contain elements from all previously visited sites, rather than elements only from the current site. I was wondering if it could be possible to reproduce the functionality of a "breadcrumb trail" for all websites. This could perhaps be accomplished, for example, by grouping the last visited pages of the current website at the top of the Go menu, above a separator. I'm sorry if I have not properly grasped the way the "Go" menu works, or have committed some other inane stupidity. Love, Karderio. [1] http://live.gnome.org/ for example. The Moinmoin wiki includes a trail by default. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: - Feature request</description>

An improvement on the Autocomplete feature would be to place more value on urls that are typed manually into the location bar versus urls that are from the browsing history. I would suggest keeping the manually typed urls around in the Autocomplete cache for a longer period of time. To be honest, I personally don't care to ever see my history show up in the Autocomplete. I only care about what I type in on a repeated basis. king regards, Casey Plummer Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Type in a url you use once in a while, but consistently. 2. Wait until the url expires from the Autocomplete cache. 1. Type in a url you use once in a while, but consistently. 3.

Instead of typing "www.example.com", I accidently type "www.example.ocm" [sic], or "ww.example.com" [sic] or something similiar. The result is the domain name is unabled to be resolved to an IP address and Firefox informs me that it cannot find the server. The invalid domain name which doesn't resolve to anything gets added to the list of websites visited. Now, if I try type "www.ex" then it will suggest me to visit "www.example.ocm", even though it is an invalid domain name that doesn't point to any real IP address. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Goto www.example.ocm 2. Type www.ex and look at the suggested website. Actual Results: It suggests me an website that does not exist, in fact the domain name doesn't even resolve to an IP address.

      <title>It should be possible to enable inline auto-complete via the Options menu</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.7) Gecko/20060909 Firefox/1.5.0.7 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.7) Gecko/20060909 Firefox/1.5.0.7 I have installed Firefox for several non-technical friends and family members for security reasons. Today, one asked why the auto-complete was not working the way she wanted (in other words the way it did so in IE). She wanted it to appear inline so all that she would have to do was go to the address bar, start typing the URL, and press Enter when it was recognized from history. There was no option in the GUI to enable this. After doing a Google search, I found that it could be enabled by going to about:config and creating a Boolean value browser.urlbar.autoFill set to True. Doing so fixed the problem on that installation. However, since many users may want to enable this feature, there should be a way to do so from Tools-&gt;Options, rather than editing the configuration file by hand. Can this be added? Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: N/A - this is a feature request. Actual Results: Inline autocomplete can be enabled from about:config, but not from Tools-&gt;Options. Expected Results: There should be a check box in Tools-&gt;Options-&gt;Advanced-&gt;General to enable this feature.</description>

      <title>"File menu" of "Web Browser" oxymoron</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1b2) Gecko/20060821 Firefox/2.0b2 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1b2) Gecko/20060821 Firefox/2.0b2 At moment, first menu item of Firefox/Mozilla's main menu is called "File". That's of course is oxymoron: Firefox/Mozilla are not used to manage local files. I'm filing that non-issue now because I have just found good name for that menu item: "Location" (Idea stolen from Konqi). "Page" for some reasons doesn't sound good to me, though would be definitely more user friendly. That way, I hope Firefox/Mozilla would be more CUI (Common User Interface) /compliant/. (Nobody uses that "CUI" abomination anymore, yet name is Okay for GUI made following common sense.) * Firefox/Mozilla doesn't work with files. It works with web locations and pages. Both "Page" and "Location" are suitable names, though I think "Location" is more technically correct: few web pages are really pages nowadays. (Or probably "Page" would fit better. It seems that most developers around the web used to "Page" rather than "Location" term.) * The only file relevant management item found in "File" menu is "Import". But again, it doesn't import web page/location what browser is designed to work with - but user preferences/bookmarks/etc from alternative browsers. * Tab/Window management commands have to go to "View" or new (well forgotten old) "Windows" menu. * "Open Location" rename to "Open" * "Save Page As" rename to "Save As" * "Save Frame As" - kill it. Anyway Firefox &amp; modern Mozilla do not highlight current frame (as it used to in older times). Only reliable way to access that function is from pop-up menu in frame itself. * "Open File" can be left here. Not often used yet required function. Cannot think of better name for it nor placement. * Provide placeholder where extensions can add their own menu items, specific to shown current web page. * Move/rename "Tools" &gt; "Page Info" to "Location" &gt; "Properties". * Add menu item for page SSL info, if any. At moment it is accessible directly only thru mouse click on lock icon in location bar. (It is part of "Page Info" dialog). * Move "Subscribe to This Page" from "Bookmarks" to "Location"/"Page" menu. It belongs here. I hope with the changes above, the "File" menu would be useful and logical place for all location/page relevant things. The consolidation of the functionality didn't happen since I think few would expect to find web relevant thing in menu called "File". Reproducible: Always</description>

      <title>The way Firefox used to display a svg image is not friendly.</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; Maxthon; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; InfoPath.1) Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; zh-CN; rv:1.8.0.6) When a svg image contians size information, and the container of the svg is small than the svg image's size. View in IE: the svg image is shrinked in size to fits the contianer. View in Firefox: the svg image is not shrinked, and horizontal &amp; vertical scroll bar will appear around the svg image, you have scrolled to see the whole image. I think the IE's way is better. And I have found some other software use the same way with IE to tread the svg image. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.Creat a html file with the attached svg image, make sure the contianer's size is smaller than the image's. 2.View the html file in Firefox and IE. Actual Results: In IE: the svg image is shrinked in size to fits the contianer. In Firefox: the svg image is not shrinked, and horizontal &amp; vertical scroll bar will appear around the svg image, you have scrolled to see the whole image. Expected Results: The Firefox's result is same with IE's. This is a SVG problem. But I can't find the svg in the Component list.</description>

The search result should open in a new background tab Extended Implementation: - We could provide the user with an option (or a hidden about:config preference) to allow him to open the new tab in the foreground instead of background. User Experience: - A very useful functionality and a definite leap in browsing experience. Can be currently experienced through extensions like Drag De Go (https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/2918/ ).

I have a page where i check my account status memory-wise. It's just an example anyway. When i click on the shortcut that i created (of course, with middle button - so it opens in a new tab), i want to be able to switch back to what i was doing, which is NOT the case - because i get that 'BEEP' that means something like good old 'unable to comply'. Another thing, it would be good to be able to middle-click on the GO button, next to the Address bar, to opet entered address in a new tab. Would add-up to the consistency. I've been waiting for this little feature(s) for quite a while now. Hope i didn't repeat. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. open a site. 2. open a new won, for which you know it will ask for a user/pass 3. try to continue what you were doing :) Actual Results: As described in the problem Expected Results: Also described - i want to be able to ignore it, at least for a while... The tab could blink to warn me something is going on.</description>

      <title>History-based anti-phishing mechanism</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.7) Gecko/20060909 Firefox/1.5.0.7 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.7) Gecko/20060909 Firefox/1.5.0.7 A suggestion for a new (additional) anti-phishing mechanism, that does not rely on blacklisting but rather on client-side, automatic whitelisting. In a nutshell: Whenever a password form is submitted, the browser should check if the user had previously logged onto this site. If not, a clear warning should be displayed prior to sending the HTTP request with the password. Technical details: Every time the user visits a website and submits a password-form, the browser remembers it. This is not maintained as part of the history, and not deleted when browsing history is deleted. To maintain privacy, the list of visited sites does not actually contain the domain names, but rather a cryptographic hash thereof. Thus, we can verify if a specific site is in the whitelist, but there is no easy way to obtain a list of visited sites. Still, for the extra-paranoid, a special menu option will be avilable for deleting the whitelist. When a user submits a password form to a site that was not whitelisted, a warning window will appear. The window will contain a brief explanation, a link to more detailed information about phishing, and mainly the question: "Are you sure you wish to submit a password to DOMAIN-NAME?" It is important that DOMAIN-NAME will be presented in all-uppercase using a serif font; this will help distinguish, e.g., PAYPAI from PAYPAL (if you're using a sans-serif font, the following could be indistinguishable: paypaI and paypal). Finally, for easier migration and a better user experience, the whitelist can be populated initially from one or more of the following sources: 1. When FF is upgraded from a previous version, without this mechanism: initialize the list based on the browser history. 2. Likewise when FF is installed on a machine with IE. 3. Pre-populate the list with known valid sites that are common phishing targets (reputable online stores, Paypal, banks, etc.) Reproducible: Always</description>

I have no clue what shortcut it must be - since all modifier shortcuts are already taken. It's kind of related to bug #279223 - since at moment it is even unknown where/how link would open. For well known offender sites (e.g. corporate intranet web applications) which often insist on opening something in new window/tab that would be very helpful. (Also that would make Google Mail top menu usable - for now it has all links to open in new window/tab what's pretty annoying.) P.S. The shortcut is another great feature found in Apple's Safari. Apple handles that elegantly: you provided with modifier shortcut to /change/ how link would open. &lt;Cmd&gt; is toggle for opening in new tab. &lt;Alt&gt; is toggle for opening in new window. &lt;Shift&gt; is toggle for opening in background. Link on web page is already marked to be open in someway: new windows, new tab. And you have set you preferences. The keys allow you toggle that. When status bar says that hovered link would open in some undesired way, you just press modifier keys until status bar says that link would open in a way you want it to be open.

Mycroft is surprisingly not even in the Top 25 plugins installed according to the site's latest stats. It is obvious that users aren't using their noggin and are accessing the site &amp; finding their plugins the 'slow' way, which is kinda ironic as Search efficiency is the very purpose of the Search Bar!

      <title>locale selection/switch toolbar widget</title>
      <description>I'm writing this bug from an Internet Cafe in Hungary, and FF uses a Hungarian locale. I'd like to switch it to English, but I can't do it (ok, I can do it with some command-line wizardry, but it would require a restart anyway). If the Cafe proprietors had the option, they would probably add to the FF toolbar a locale-changing button, or a multi-value-toggle like you have on the Windows/KDE/Gnome taskbar. We're talking an optional button of course, not something appearing on the toolbar by default.</description>

      <title>Make about and other generated pages more easily stylable</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20060924 BonEcho/2.0 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20060924 BonEcho/2.0 The browser needs to assign a unique ID to the html tag of each generated page. This ID would then be available for use to style the page (e.g. through a theme, userContent.css, extension, etc). If confirmed as an RFE, this will be a tracking bug to the changes for the individual pages. Reasoning: It is difficult to style most of the about:* pages (and others) that are generated internally by Firefox. These pages are not chrome, but are instead usually rendered as html content. This, and the fact that the pages are not uniquely identified, makes it hard to style the page according to the current theme being used in Firefox. Reproducible: Always The most obvious pages that need to be addressed are those most commonly used by users. This includes about:blank, about:plugins, and about:. Hopefully, all generated content will eventually have its own unique ID. For the purpose of clarity, the IDs should all start with a similar prefix; preferrably "about-". Below is a tentative list of pages that need to be addressed. Some pages already have subelements with their own IDs, but are not fully stylable since their html element still has no ID. about: &gt; html - &gt; div "#aboutPageContainer" about:blank &gt; html - about:buildconfig &gt; html - about:cache &gt; html - about:cache-entry &gt; html - about:credits &gt; html - about:license &gt; html - &gt; body "#lic-info" about:mozilla &gt; html - &gt; p "#moztext" &gt; p "#from" about:plugins &gt; html - &gt; div "#outside" view-source: &gt; html - &gt; body "#viewsource" about:config is a special case that renders as chrome and already has a usable ID (#config); so it does not need to be modified.</description>

      <title>.tabs-alltabs-stack should be 24 pixels wide instead of 18</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061002 BonEcho/2.0 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061002 BonEcho/2.0 .tabs-alltabs-stack should be 24 pixels wide instead of 18. By widening .tabs-alltabs-stack, it both makes it easier to click on and, more importantly, it will allow for at least 2 ways at 1280 width for fixed width tabs to perfectly fill the scrollbox with it still present. Example: 18 is divisible by 2,3,6,9,18 24 is divisible by 2,3,4,6,8,12,24 Having 2 or 3 tabs fixed width filling the scrollbox with no overflow are obviously useless. However, the bigger problem is that the rest of the components on the tab bar have widths that are divisible by both 4 AND 6, making .tabs-alltabs-stack the odd one out. So, by then having .tabs-alltabs-stack width equal to 18, it takes away all the possible multiples of 4. (for reference, .scrollbutton-up and .scrollbutton-down-stack add up to 36 pixels, the close button at the right is 24 pixels if enabled, I am assuming that .tabs-left has been removed by editing userChrome.css for simplicity) Here I will compare having 3,4,6,8,12,24 as the possible number of fixed width tabs to perfectly fill the scrollspace without overflow to 3,6,9,18, each at 1280 width resolution. As 1280 minus 18 or 1280 minus 24 are already not divisible by 3,6,9,12, 18, or 24, that immediately limits the first set to only 4 or 8 as possibilities, but even worse, it limites the second set to none (which is the bug). By making .tabs-alltabs-stack 24 pixels wide it would open up these possibilities, and would also open up even more possibilities at other resolutions, for example, at 1152 width.

You have a microsummary that displays (for example) the latest bid from an eBay auction. The microsummary update interval is the firefox default of 30 minutes. at 12:00 the microsummary updates itself to show the latest bid is $100 at 12:10 a new bid is placed for $120 at 12:20 you visit the auction in question by clicking the microsummary When you visit the auction in question, the microsummary will still read '$100' even tho you have just visited the site, and can see the current bid is '$120' at 12:30 the microsummary will update itself to read '$120'. I think if you choose to manually visit a site, and it is part of a microsummary, then the microsummary should be immediately updated so it doesn't appear to display contradictory information.</description>

But when I have fewer than 7 tabs open, Firefox draws an [x] button the active tab but not on the other tabs, but if I mouseover another tab then the [x] button appears. The problem is that when I'm moving my mouse to click on another tab, I'm "aiming" for anywhere on the tab and suddenly I click the tab before I realize that an [x] button has appeared and I end up closing the tab instead of switching to it. Personally, I don't really like having an [x] on every tab.. but I feel like if you're going to do that, it should always be there and not just on the mouseover. I'd rather see it have an [x] on the active tab, and allow you to right-click other tabs to close them without switching to them. But that's just my opinion. Reproducible: Always</description>

This would be nice to have because, without it, there is really no way of making sure that a box which may contain arbitrary text (e.g. because it is derived from user input) does not exceed a specified width. It is also worth noting that this property is supported by Internet Explorer, at least in 6.0 and possibly in earlier versions. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: Create a table with several cells and put a CSS width property on one of them. Also put "word-wrap: break-word". Then put a really, really long word (like WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW) into one of the cells. Actual Results: Since the CSS property is unsupported, the text stretches the box horizontally instead of forcing a line break. Expected Results: Line breaks get inserted in mid-word as necessary to prevent the box from stretching horizontally.</description>

      <title>Add option to disable search engine autodiscovery notification (search bar glow)</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061003 Firefox/2.0 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061003 Firefox/2.0 New feature of upcoming Ff2.0 is search engine management and option for web pages to provide plugs for such search engines. Presence of site specific search engine in standard theme is indicated by "glowing" up search engine selection button. The problem is that "glowing" effect isn't optional and to turn it off I have to add the engine, what messes up my search engine list. Scenario: I want to have 2 engines only so that switching would be very fast. But now I have to have 8 so that there would be no glow on sites I have to work with every day. This of course messes up my search engines by useless to me bloat. That's not the same as SSL indication - which is active only when I work with SSL protected site (and that's rather important bit). RSS indication is also not that annoying, since it is normally available only for particular pages with news lines only. The search engines are normally available for whole site - what means that the button glows on every page I visit, what is redundant and needless to say very irritating. In other words I want to have and option to turn that glow off. I still might want to add engine from a site - but I do not need to told every time that I can do that. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. go to www.theregister.co.uk - it glows 2. open any article - it still glows 3. open any other article - it glows again 4. open en.wikipedia.org - it glows no mater what 5. open any article - it glows regardless Actual Results: Search engine selection button glows every time. Expected Results: Search engine selection button doesn't glow at all. Also as I noted in comment to other bug, mix of blue and gray used for glow is really bad color combination. (I might opine also that Home Page button color in new theme is also stands out too much: brown + gray also mix poorly. I had to remove from toolbar so that it wouldn't irritate my eyes. Previous white icon was fitting gray interface better.) P.S. Only workaround I know is to install Google Toolbar and replace standard Ff search with Google's one. But that's again degradation of functionality.</description>

      <title>Multilingual / multi-language Firefox package for MacOS X</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.7) Gecko/20060909 Firefox/1.5.0.7 Build Identifier: Currently if I want to have Firefox available in English and French on MacOS X, so that: - when user 'a' logs in he get to use Firefox in French - when user 'b' logs in she get to use Firefox in English I need to have two versions of Firefox installed. This is contrary to the intended MacOS X design where one application is available in multiple languages - rather than multiple localised versions of the same application on the same computer. For this reason this enhancement request would be to have a multilingual Firefox binary for MacOS X. Eventually this approach could be carried over to other platforms. Also: If the intended language pack is not available on the user's computer that matches the user's login environment, but is found to be available online then the user should be asked whether he wishes to download it or use one of the currently available installed language packs. If the choice is the latter then it is remembered until the login environment language is changed. optional keywords: localisaton, localization, internationalisation, internationalization, locale, application Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

The FF 1.5 close tab button should close all buttons The add bookmarks button should automatically create either new bookmarks for all selected tabs, Or create a new tab-set. allowing the user to open all tabs at once. Dragging the set around in the tab bar should re-arange the entire set, not just the current tab. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.click the current tab 2.press shift 3.click any other tab Actual Results: Apply tab selection graphics, and options Expected Results: general browsing sweetness should appear.</description>

When writing extensions, authors sometimes need to write different skins for Mac builds and the only way to specify a Mac only CSS is to use Javascript to detect the user agent and then change some CSS class names, or set a DOM attribute and then use the CSS selector to switch the skin accordingly. e.g., The following pseudo-code may be used: if(Mac) node.setAttribute("macos","true") #button1 {border:1px solid} #button1[macosx="true"] {border:0px} In the past, it used to be possible to use the macBrowserOverlay.xul to set the attribute automatically (without Javascript), but now it doesn't seem to work. I propose that Mac builds have an attribute on some root node so that extension developers can write conditional CSS skins. Reproducible: Always</description>

      <title>Firefox should be able to create microsummaries without need for embedment in webpage</title>
      <description>Microsummaries are pretty cool, but at the moment only webpages that have a microsummary embedded in them can use this feature easily. If a website doesn't supply a microsummary then you are able to write one yourself and then add it manually to your firefox profile dir, etc. Both these ways are unnecessarily cumbersome. The first way (a microsummary embedded into a website) means that the webmaster must provide the microsummary themselves. Do they want to? Can they be bothered to? Will they microsummarize the information the end user wants? Is it worth their time if no one knows about/uses microsummaries? The second way (writing it yourself and manually getting it into firefox) is technically difficult and not something that your average end user will ever bother with. So what's the alternative? How about firefox generating the microsummary code for the end user itself! I imagine it would work something along these lines: An end user reading a website highlights some text and then click Bookmarks &gt; Add Microsummary Bookmark. A bookmark is created pointing at the URL, and the Microsummary would be the highlighted text. The dialog for Add Microsummary Bookmark might also contain a way of setting the update interval for the microsummary (firefox default currently 30 mins, with a minimum interval of one minute allowed). This would encourage use of microsummaries by all people, irregardless of whether the website you were microsummarizing cared about firefox or microsummaries or not. It would allow end users to easily make their own microsummaries for their own purposes. It would also not be much of a UI hit; an extra item in the Bookmarks menu, an extra item on the right click context menu and probably an updated Bookmarks dialog to allow the user to change the update frequency if making a microsummary. There's no need for websites to have to provide the microsummary for firefox - empower the users instead!</description>

      <description>When we rebrand firefox (via --with-branding) there should also be some way to change the name of the executable. It's kind of strange starting IceWeasel or FirePants or whatever by launching "firefox.exe"... This sounds like a job for $(MOZ_APP_NAME) except that's not easily settable either.

      <title>PGP/GPG encryption and signing support for Firefox</title>

I was reading this blog: http://www.links.org/?p=130 and comments, and got an idea how to enable better security for users using web mail. My idea is to build GPG into Firefox or at least integrate it. GPG keyring (user's private and public key) should be an object similar to certificate. User will be able to create/import it into Firefox, export it or delete it. Keyring could be secured with password (with FireFox security device), and additionaly with passphrase. Public keys could be easily retrieved from public key servers. How decryption will work? If FireFox will detect PGP/GPG code (in a form), it will enable decryption. When decrypted, it will be "grabbed", decrypted and shown in plaintext. Similar to Enigmail extension for Thunderbird. And since there is a portable Firefox for Windows (http://portableapps.com/), user will be able to use strong encryption from his/her USB drive. Sorry again for posting this here, I was unable to find direct "feature request". Please just think of this idea. It should be developed in more detail, of course. But if it will be implemented, it will bring strong encryption for broad audience of users. And the problem of scurity of the webmail will be solved. Reproducible: Always</description>

      <title>pref for overriding maxVersion</title>
      <description>I just d/l'ed Firefox 2.0rc3, and unfortunately, many extensions have not yet updated their maxVersion - even though it's fairly obvious that 2.0b1 and up also means 2.0rc3 compatibility. Sure, that isn't a certainty - but I'd like to try it anyway. Another scenario is when an extension stops being developped, so no one bumps the maxVersion even if it can be bumped up to the current release or to the trunk version. So what I would like is a pref, which, when set to true, will allow non-disabled extensions to be run irrespective of the maxVersion (or maybe the minVersion as well). Possibly, before the first time a seemingly incompatible extension is enabled there can be a confirmation dialog, but that's just icing.</description>

I strongly prefer having a single 'Close current tab' button on the end of the tab bar, rather than having separate close buttons on each tab. In particular, when you get to a point where opening and closing tabs causes the tabs themselves to change widths, the close button then becomes a moving target. Best solution IMHO would be to make both button locations be options in the Tab section of Options, letting both locations be used as prefered. Reproducible: Always</description>

Implementation example: - when "Block pop-up windows" is enabled, keep everything the same as the current implementation - when it is disabled, instead of graying out the "Exceptions" button, change it to a "Block List" button - store both the "exceptions" and "block" lists, separately - add a button to the toolbar which toggles between "Allow Pop-Ups from this site" and "Block Pop-Ups from this site", depending on preference state.

      <title>Double clicking on the tab overflow scroll buttons should scroll by the width of the tab bar</title>
      <description>Much of the criticism for our implementation of tab overflow is how it is really slow and awkward for power users to manage. However, I have a proposal to make the overflow tolerable and quick for power users of Firefox. Most power users are familiar with the usefulness of the middle-mouse button. So, I thought that clicking the overflow buttons with the middle mouse button should scroll by a large amount. Ideally, by the width of the tab strip. I made an implementation of this and found that I could go from one end of the tab strip to the other, with about 25 tabs open, in 3 mouse clicks. This was with the default minTabWidth. In my opinion, this would help make tab overflow a lot more tolerable while adding no feature or UI bloat whatsoever. Nonetheless, I need your thoughts.</description>

      <title>Make Live Titles more discoverable [microsummaries]</title>
      <description>Users need easier, more discoverable access to the Live Titles interface. Currently, the interface is hidden in Bookmarks &gt; (bookmark) &gt; Properties &gt; Name field &gt; Listbox dropdown arrow. Until the user clicks that arrow, nothing indicates that Live Titles exists at all. I knew about Live Titles but when beginning to use FF2, 1) I didn't remember or notice they'd been implemented, and 2) Once I knew, I couldn't find the interface. I doubt most end users will be able to figure it out. I can think of three scenarios in which the user would add a Live Title: 1) Drag a link to the bookmarks 2) Ctrl+D / Bookmarks &gt; Bookmark this page. 3) Existing Bookmarks #1 DRAG A LINK TO BOOKMARKS When the user drags a link to their bookmarks, nothing indicates that a Live Title is an option, nor is there any way to use it. After that, the user is working with an existing bookmark (see #3, below). I don't know an elegant solution. A dialog could ask,'Use a Live or static Title?', but that seems cumbersome. Maybe display an explanation the first time, with a 'never show this dialog again' checkbox? Perhaps a visual indicator that a Live Title exists for this bookmark? Some change to icon, text, or background color? #2 CTRL+D / BOOKMARKS &gt; BOOKMARK THIS PAGE The only indicator here is the drop-down arrow for the Name field. It's easy to miss, it's not labeled, and nothing about it 'means' "Live Title"; the arrow could be for any function. Clicking the arrow displays options labeled "Live Titles"; but there is still no explanation of what LT does and it's a brand new feature for most users. #3 EXISTING BOOKMARKS If you right-click an existing bookmark, the context menu does not indicate the existance of Live Titles (unless you are already using LT for that bookmark). If you enter properties, you see the same interface as #2, above. See bug 337825 forthe original discussion of the interface.</description>

      <title>enable pages to specify microsummaries within the pages themselves</title>
      <description>Currently, a page that wants to specify its microsummary has to point to a different resource which contains the microsummary instead of merely inlining the microsummary within the page itself. This is intentional, as microsummaries are much smaller than the pages they summarize, and hosting them at a separate resource significantly reduces the burden on the server of loading those microsummaries. But in some cases sites may prefer the ease of inlining to the reduced load of hosting separately, and we should make it possible for sites to make that choice. I see two possibilities for how we could do this: 1. We could allow a page to specify that its title is its microsummary (in which case we would use it much as we already use page titles for labeling bookmarks, except that we would regularly check it for changes and update bookmarks accordingly). 2. We could define a type of meta tag for specifying a microsummary.</description>

This technique has been used on numerous web pages (think del.icio.us, Flickr) And, i would LOVE to see it implemented in Firefox. The only reason I use del.icio.us is the way that tags are utilized for bookmarking pages. I would ditch them if I could take Firefox with me on my USB stick and have a similar bookmark "cloud".

The time from clicking a link or entering a URL to initial display of the page is increased by about 1/10 s when the tabbar is present. This doesn't sound like alot but it really changes the browsing experience expecially when quickly navigating a site. A friend and me were quite disappointed to see opera easily outperform FF but we finally nailed it down to the tabbar being hid/visible. I guess the tabbar shouldn't take that mouch processing power and something seems to be messed up. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.Open a fresh FF window 2.navigate around a site with good load times ( maybe even locally stored ) 3.add a Tab ( or more. doesn't matter) and compare navigation speed. 4.quantify your annoyance with the Faster Fox Add-on Expected Results: Tabbar shouldn't eat that much time. Faster Fox helps quantifying the perceived lag with its 'Page Load Timer'.</description>

      <title>Tab key should focus first visible item instead of first item (if page has been scrolled)</title>

Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.Open Firefox, Start Google.com 2.type "mozilla" in a search window 3.press page down few times to browse to the very end of the list 4.press tab Firefox sets focus to the first link while your actual view is different. Expected Results: Start Opera. 1. Reproduce steps 1 and 2 from above (search for "firefox" in google and scroll down with PgDown to the end of the list) 2. Press Shift+Down And Opera selects the very first link of your actual view. IMHO that kind of behavior is more logical.</description>

      <title>No proxy for: Override proxy settings</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.7) Gecko/20060909 Firefox/1.5.0.7 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.7) Gecko/20060909 Firefox/1.5.0.7 I am not sure if this is a bug report or a feature request. This is probably expected behavior but changing the behavior would be great. In the config dialog where you set the list of hosts and addresses, if an address is entered, it is only honored with an exact match of the url as typed in the url box. I am a developer and often set up a local site which I override in my hosts file to point to my local development address. Even though localhost and 127.0.0.1 is set up in the bypass proxy settings, the hosts file is not consulted before comparing to this value. If you type in the hostname that you have overriden to localhost, the request still goes down the proxy. It would be great if the program resolved the hosts file first and compares the IP address to the list of bypass hosts. I realize that this is another hit to the hosts file for every proxy request but this could possibly be cached in memory for best performance. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.override a host in your hosts file to point to 127.0.0.1 2.enter 127.0.0.1 into the bypass proxy textbox in settings dialog 3.enter the name of the host you have overridden into the url bar of firefox. 4.press enter or click go. Actual Results: The request is served by the proxy and the proxy is not bypassed. Expected Results: I would expect firefox to know that the host is local based on a lookup of the hosts file.</description>

      <title>Firefox: Let authors put line breaks (newlines) in tooltips (title attribute)</title>
      <description>Many web authors make use of the MSIE behavior that translates newlines in title attributes into line breaks in the resulting tooltip. This has led to frequent requests for Mozilla to do the same thing; see for example the many votes, comments, and duplicates for bug 67127 (which was until recently listed as a Core bug rather than being specific to the Suite: this bug is being filed to fill the void due to that change). See that bug for several testcases, some attempted patches, and very lengthy discussion. Note that this bug is related to bug 218223, but that bug asks for automatic wrapping of tooltips to multiple lines while this one asks for explicit author-specified line breaks. Emulating MSIE's behavior is not ideal: it can easily lead to accidental line breaks if the HTML source is word-wrapped, and it is not compatible with web standards. The HTML 4.01 spec (http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/types.html#h-6.2) says that "User agents should interpret attribute values as follows: * Replace character entities with characters, * Ignore line feeds, * Replace each carriage return or tab with a single space." This rules out a direct mapping of source code newlines to tooltip line breaks. However, it could be consistent with the spec to allow character entities such as &amp;#10; to yield tooltip line breaks by delaying entity replacement until after explicit CRs and tabs have been replaced by spaces. (Technically, the spec does not say what order those steps must occur in.) The desired behavior is outlined in bug 67127 comment 131. Before any patch enabling this would work, two things would need to happen. First, the parsing behavior would need to change as outlined above: this would rely on the details of the eventual fix to bug 322270 (enabling the desired behavior may not be feasible). And second, my interim Firefox patch for bug 67127 would need to be reverted (see bug 67127 comment 214 for details: note that for most existing pages, the effect of my interim patch is identical to the effect of any eventual fix for bug 322270). A patch for this issue may in fact be in easy reach (subject to those two caveats): both bug 67127 and bug 45375 were recently fixed for the SeaMonkey suite by the patch in bug 356900, and it seems likely that it could be adapted for Firefox. (I haven't had the time to try yet myself.) Given that, it isn't clear that bug 228673 is actually a dependency for this bug, but I'm copying it over here from bug 67127 at least until a Firefox patch that works around it does appear. (Bug 356900 comment 15 indicates that the workaround won't be necessary once the reflow branch lands for Firefox 3; if we do get a workaround fix here before then, a Firefox analogue of bug 357337 would be necessary.)</description>

      <title>Feed preview should include pubDate of each entry</title>
      <description>Despite my efforts I still can't find another bug for this. I am not asking for a full feed reader, just more information being shown in the preview, so this shouldn't be a dupe of bug 343029. And I am only asking to show date &amp; time, not any of the other hoopla that bug 354859 entails. I made a patch which addresses this. It will convert the date given in each entry to the user's local time zone and display it in a professional syntax. Think IE7. This will add to our feed preview but still keep it as just a preview.</description>

However having two widgets close together introduces discomfort as I now have to aim for the right one. I realize that the close tabs is not on by default, but you still have the close button of the rightmost tab to worry about. I think it would be best to move the list all tabs to the far left so that it's the only widget there. Reproducible: Always</description>

There are the Tool &amp; Side Bar's which could possibly get their own list in the Add On's window. And there are the dictionary's which could be installed (in most cases a user should only install one of them, except in those cases you live in a bilingual not native english speaking country &amp; you end up installing about three of them or even more if you are a real polyglot). Again they might better have their own list in the Add On Window. It would be great to see Firefox 2.0 somehow to get these small changes rather soon, maybe in a Firefox 2.0.1 Release. I also wanted to request for a multilingual version of firefox OS X (like the camino guys make one for Camino) instead of language specific monolingual release - maybe the camino project also has some internationalized parts which in firefox OS X are only available in english ( inside the xxxx.app you find the talkback.app application ) Reproducible: Always</description>

Why when I open bookmarks with "Open All in Tabs" link I lose my currently opened tabs? Why don't it open in new tabs by default? I think it's more logic that it open in new tabs other than overriding my opened tabs !! why would I have to open a new window then "Open All in Tabs" to get bookmarks opened without losing my currently opened tabs? What if I've too many bookmarks in a folder so I cannot right click on every bookmark and "open in a new tab"?? should I open a new window then? I think opening a new window for that will make the great "tabbed browsing feature" of Firefox less useful ... Thanks very very very much for you great efforts :) !

Instead, the new tab should open to the right of the current tab so that you can see the tab you just opened.

I'd say the popularity of RSS (and Atom) feeds substantially benefited from the launch of the feed icon, which is now recognized cross-platform. Hence, I think that there should be some discussion about microsummaries' visual identity, which could drive other browser manufacturers toward implementing them. There doesn't seem to be a bug for this yet (although bug 348944, for one, would benefit from it), and feel free to disagree with me here, or remind me that I'm not a dev and shouldn't interfere to this extent.

      <title>There is no "deny always" option for certificates</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0 There's two things going on here, one of which _might_ be a bug, and one of which is a feature request. In the cert management process, when you're presented with a new certificate that can't be validated by some authority, you are given the option to accept now, accept always or deny now. There is no Deny Always option. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Try to deny a certificate that is required (whatever that means) several times on a page. 2. Click deny, several times, not just once. 3. Actual Results: On many weblogs that include paypal links, for example, if you've decided not to trust verisign as a root CA, you have to click three or more times on identical dialogs to deny the paypal cert (just as an example). Expected Results: One click per cert per page. This part is, I think, the "bug" part - if you've chosen to deny the paypal cert once, you shouldn't have to do it again for the same page. The additional feature that I'd like to request here is that fourth button, that you should also (like password-saving) be able to choose to _never_ accept that certificate, deny-always. I realize that the UI here is cluttered already, but I also think it's a reasonable feature to include, so there you go. Sorry if "security" is the wrong place to file this one.</description>

Example: I have to send only my Photography folders to a friend. With FF 1.5 and 2.0 I can only export the whole bookmarks file, messed with many extra info (last visited, added etc) that in this case I don't need to export.

When using Google's Browser Sync on public computers it is possible to clear all your sync'd data on close using the Clear Private Data feature, that is all *except* your bookmarks. I know that this may be an issue only for those who sync setting on public computer and may possible be better addressed in the browser sync'ing extensions but I think it would be an unobtrusive feature of the core browser anyway.</description>

Basically just a window that is completely sandboxed. Perhaps also as a menu item off of a right-clicked hyperlink (open in private window...)? I try to keep track of and clean my cookies and cache, if someone sends me a link to some unknown place it would be great to know that I can open it up in a special window/tab and when I close it, all of the cookies/cache/etc. that it generates will be gone. If this is a duplicate I apologize, I could not find anything like this while searching through the bug list. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: N/A -- feature request</description>

I propose 2 simple additions to the feed API to address this: 1) Add an integer "mode" attribute to nsIFeedProcessor, which can be set to one of MODE_NORMAL, MODE_FEED_METADATA_ONLY, MODE_FEED_ENTRY_ONLY_TITLES_AND_LINKS (not really attached to the names here). The default is MODE_NORMAL, and it'll behave as it does currently. 2) Add an analogous "mode" parameter to nsIFeedContainer, so you can look up how a given feed or entry has been parsed. Given an agreed upon API, I will implement this. Reproducible: Always</description>

      <title>Dragging a Tab to a new window does not maintain form entries</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0 While I'm sure this is likely to be a dupe, I can't find the original in the system; I did search, and I apologize. On the off-chance that it's not a dupe- Dragging a tab from one Firefox window to another works well, even though it is not specifically coded. It drags the URL, and in doing so re-loads the URL, appearing as if you dragged the tab to the new window. In doing so, however, the new tab loses everything that was entered into that original page, such as entries in a form. The 10.5 version of Safari supports dragging and dropping tabs between windows, and it's not unreasonable user behavior. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open a website with a long form, such as Bugzilla 2. Enter information into the form 3. Open a new browser window 4. Drag the tab from the first window to the second Actual Results: The second window will load the page fresh, with no information. Your tab will continue to remain in the original window. Expected Results: The second window will contain the tab with the filled out information. The original window will no longer contain the tab.</description>

Currently (ver. 2.0), it is always sorted according to the most visited pages, with no option to change this behavior. In conjuction with the preference "browser.urlbar.autoFill = true" from "about:config", this offered the user a way to type only the first letters of each part of the address and let the browser's location bar autocomplete the rest of the next part for him only.

This is very user unfriendly and I wonder why this has become worse with every version of FF: - In V1 I opened the cooky list, checked, "block this cooky", selected the unwanted cookie and pressed delete. Very nice when I wanted to just delete some cookies and block others. - In V1.5 I had to check the "block deleted cookies" checkbox outside the cooky list. This made it quite cumbersome because I had to switch back and forth between the outer and the inner dialog. - Now, with V2 the option to block a cooky from the cooky list is completely gone. At least, I can't find it. I have looked for an equivalent option but I can't find it. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open Tools/options/Privacy/Cookies/Show cookies 2. 3. Actual Results: There is no option there to block an unqanted cooky from the list. Expected Results: An option to block an unwanted cooky from the cooky list I know that I can manually enter cookies in the exception list. I know that I can set FF to ask me every time about what to do with a cookie. But both of these are very *tedious* and annoying. I'll show you my use case: It is what I want to do and what worked perfectly well in V1, resonably well in V1.5 and no more in V2: - Happily surfing the web with all cookies being accepted. I'm fine with that. - One or two times a week I open Tools/Options/Privacy and open the cooky list - I then go through the list and remove unwanted cookies *and* I want some of them to be completely blocked from now on - I don't want to take a note of the unwanted cooky, close the cooky list, open the exceptions list and type in the cooky there and this is what FF 2.0 now forces me to do - I want to block unwanted cookies from the cookies list. That worked perfectly well in V1, reasonably wll in V1.5 and not at all in V2</description>

We shouldn't limit this to &lt;textarea&gt; tags. It should work in &lt;input type="text"&gt; too.</description>

      <title>[SessionStore] Add 'Recently Closed Windows'/'Undo Close Window' (or make API easier on extensions)</title>
      <description>It would be useful to have a 'Recently Closed Windows' menu that works as for 'Recently Closed Tabs' (and maybe an Undo Close Window keyboard shortcut too). While you're less likely to accidentally close a window than a tab, it can still be useful to go back to an earlier window, and it would be cheap to implement. Implementation -------------- Bug 344642 removed the Undo Close Window API from the SessionStore API because it wasn't being used in Fx2 (and there wasn't time to test it). Reverting that would provide the necessary backend, and it would just need a menu and shortcut hooking up. Alternative ----------- If this isn't implemented, then it'd be good to change the SessionStore API so extensions can at least do this themselves without horrific hacks. At the moment one would expect the following code to dump data on closed windows, but getWindowState throws an exception because in the nsSessionStore service's own "domwindowclosed" observer it voids the window data (dietrich confirmed the problem on IRC). Components .classes["@mozilla.org/observer-service;1"] .getService(Components.interfaces.nsIObserverService) .addObserver( { observe: function(aSubject, aTopic, aData) { var state = Components .classes["@mozilla.org/browser/sessionstore;1"] .getService(Components.interfaces.nsISessionStore) .getWindowState(aSubject); dump(state); } }, "domwindowclosed", false ); Note: the window state actually gets invalidated at http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla1.8/source/browser/components/sessionstore/src/nsSessionStore.js#481</description>

      <title>provide a user choice/override mechanism for audio objects with autostart="true"</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0 Build Identifier: Websites can take control of a user's audio output device without permission, or warning towards the users. If the website offers no audio controls the user has no choice but to disable all output from the device or to leave the page. This feature can be exploited for intrusive adverisements, just like windows could once pop-up out of nowhere before Firefox was fitted with a pop-up blocker. The audio output can interfere with the output from other applications and even mimic their sounds which could possibly be used for phishing purposes since the user cannot tell from which application, or page the sound originated. Although there are currently not yet any examples of these practices it would be best to avoid them. This feature also breaks in multi-tasking environments, in the current situation Firefox will play the audio from one page, other pages with embedded audio that are opened in other tabs or windows will not play at all. Unexpected and unwanted audio can also be a problem for people using a speech synthesizer to read the pages for them. A possible solution for this problem would be to display a notification bar as used by the pop-up blocker which asks the user to inform the user that the website wants to play an audio file and asks for it's permission. Pages should not be allowed to access the audio output device when they are out of focus, unless given explicit permission by the user to do so. This could be done in the form a contextual menu. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: Visit any page that contains a code that will play audio automatically, for example: &lt;embed src="BigChurchOrgan.mp3" type="audio/x-mp3" loop="true" autostart="true"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;</description>

I would suggest that in ADDITION to what we have already when right-clicking text, add another menu item like 'other search engines' that opens another pop-up menu listing all the other search engines installed.

I would like for that ability to be extended to tabs. It would be wonderful if I could right-click on any tab, and select a "Send Tabs as Links" option. This option would create an e-mail that included the URL to every tab that was currently open in the browser session from which the "Send Tabs as Links" option was selected. There are many times that I've done some research on a topic, opening up multiple tabs on the topic within a browser window, and want to share all of those tabs as links with my colleagues without having to copy-and-paste each link into an e-mail.

As suggested in Bug 338427 the first language to be used could be the page language but this doesn't have to be 100% accurate. A different language can be set in the HTML code compared to the language actually used on the website. By remembering the spell check language for each site after you changed it, these problems can be prevented. Reproducible: Always P.s. The bug tracker could use a 'Spell checker' item in the 'Component' list.</description>

      <title>add to Google Reader (bypass Google RSS landing page)</title>
      <description>Since Firefox 2, I can click on the orange RSS feed icon in the URL bar to add the site's RSS feed to Google Reader. When I do this, I am taken to a page on google.com asking me whether I want to add the feed to my Google personalized home page or to my Google Reader feeds. I always choose Google Reader, so I'd rather bypass this question. It seems I can do this by changing the browser.feeds.handlers.webservice and browser.contentHandlers.auto.application/vnd.mozilla.maybe.feed preferences to http://fusion.google.com/addtoreader?feedurl=%s. Can we either make this the default (completely bypassing the Google landing page for all users) or find some other way of allowing the user to bypass it (e.g. having separate items in the "Subscribe to the feed using" RSS preference box).</description>

      <title>Simplify the overall user interface - integrate "Go", "Stop", "Reload" buttons into single control</title>

When a user types a new address into the bar, the "Go" icon (forward arrow) appears in the button. The user can press the button to begin loading the requested page. While the page is loading, the "Go" icon changes to the "Stop" icon (red X). When the page has loaded, the "Stop" icon changes to the "Reload" icon (cycling arrow). The "Reload" icon remains until the user enters a new unique web site address, and then it changes into the "Go" icon. This way, the "Reload" and "Stop" icons can be eliminated, reducing the visual clutter and simplifying the interface beyond the simplicity offered in the new Windows Internet Explorer. This change would also allow an address bar to be included in pop-up windows, offering the user some amount of control of the page loading. This would be especially useful if the user does not want a pop-up window to continue loading. Reproducible: Always</description>

In this enhancement bug report, I'd like to suggest that the "home page" button functionality be moved to the drop-down menu in the address field. When the user clicks the arrow for the drop-down menu, the first option in the menu is always the home page, and it is identified by the "home" icon preceding the title of the home page. It would be separated from the rest of the entries in the drop-down menu by a horizontal line. Together with my previous suggestion for eliminating the separate "stop" and "reload" buttons, this suggestion would allow only the "back" and "forward" arrows to appear before the address bar, simplifying the user experience greatly and distinguishing it further from versions of Internet Explorer. The separate 'reload', 'stop', and 'home' icons can be a thing of the past, leaving room for a longer address bar. Reproducible: Always</description>

Such a feature would interrupt your browsing session once every hour and stop you from typing for 5 minutes. This feature could either be disabled by default, or be set to some insanely high value like a 2-second lock every 8 hours of continuous use. Such a high value would affect very few people.

But at the very bottom, there is a link "This isn't a web forgery". That sentence is very confusing if you don't realize that what it really means is "Click here if this isn't a web forgery". The kind of person that needs the well-written paragraph above this link probably won't understand the implied "click here", and read this as a sentence that contradicts the previous paragraph. This text should be more explicit ("Click here if..."), or at least look more button-like. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Put yourself in your Mom's shoes 2. Click on a link in your spam folder 3. Read the message Actual Results: I'm confused - is this a forgery or isn't it? Expected Results: I'm very certain - this is a forgery.

      <title>apply optimized build flags to Firefox for Intel Mac</title>
      <description>I'm surprised I didn't see this already reported. Somebody dupe it if I just missed it in the search. Neil Lee is distributing an optimized version of Firefox with compile flags for G3, G4, G5 and Intel macs: http://www.beatnikpad.com/archives/2006/10/26/firefox-20 This makes some sense for the G3-5 line but for the Intel Macs the CPU's are more homogeneous. Speedup on this MBP/C2D is from 10.5 seconds to create a new browser window to 3.2 seconds (10 sample average). I guess this could also be reported as a "firefox is slow on intel macs" bug - whatever, but Neil's compile flags appear to be the fix. I hear from many mac alpha-geeks that they run this build without drawbacks. I'm reporting this against the 2.0 branch because that's where the effort has been targeted, but the Trunk would probably appreciate similar love.</description>

      <title>Add unbranded Firefox builds to release deliverables</title>
      <description>Tracking bug for providing unbranded/"free" builds of Firefox for win32/Linux/Mac. These would be builds without any trademarked branding and no talkback bits. To do this, I think we just need to turn $shiptalkback off in the tinder-configs and remove any references to --enable-official-branding. I think we'll need to turn off --enable-update-packaging and the update generation stuff in the tinder-configs; anything else I'm missing? We'll likely stick these builds in the contrib directory within the ftp structure. Timeframe for this is the Firefox 2.0.0.2 release. I'll take this, to ensure it doesn't get lost in the shuffle.</description>

      <description>This is a top user support issue. When users experience a problem, they are commonly unaware of the existence of the profile, and they attempt troubleshooting by uninstalling and reinstalling. The help documentation lacks any information on troubleshooting. There should be a top-level section, which should include, at a minimum: (1) notice that settings and user data are stored in the profile folder, which are not affected by uninstallation or reinstallation; (2) instructions on using safe mode, or whatever other approved troubleshooting methods are available.</description>

But still there are some important files that are needed to be backup. Like 'localstore.rdf ' : many users already has faced this problem : toolbar customization has lost after restart or crash. if FF provides a Backup-auto Restore system for localstore.rdf just like bookmarks.bak or bookmarkbackups then an end user doesn't have to face any difficulty as FF itself takes care of ''localstore.rdf ' corruption other files are : key3.db signons.txt ( I think password files (key3.db and signons.txt ) are more important than bookmarks.html or localstore.rdf ) My suggestion is to implement a common backup-restore system for these files which are much important as much as bookmarks.html. if you think about the size of localstore.rdf , it is &lt; 100 kb ( in my profile it is 57kb ) signons.txt+key3.db &lt; 50kb so backing up 2 or 3 copies of these files ( in the same way for bookmarks ) will not take much space in hard disk but it will curb the negative effect of abrupt corruption of these files Reproducible: Always</description>

I think this is one of the best forms of advertisement for your product. Every time I install Firefox at a public computer I need to reset my settings, and worse I get all the first time prompts for things like secure websites and remembering passwords. This is especially problematic because if I antecedently accept password logging I may face serious security risks. My suggestion is for there to be a simple file containing current Firefox settings which can be saved. People could email this file to themselves so that they could access it anywhere. When they install Firefox at a public computer they could save the file to desktop and use an import - browse function that would quickly load these settings to the newly installed version of Firefox. Settings that I would include - Bookmarks and Bookmark toolbar, Google toolbar, all options settings and homepage. Major benefits: -compete with explorer. People would be even more apt to use Firefox if they could have their personal settings anywhere. -Access larger market. The more public computers that Firefox is on the more people will be exposed to it. -You could include an option to let people send you this file. This would be useful in analyzing which options people prefer. I know you do not respond to all of the suggestions, but if this is implemented it would make me happy to know.

      <title>Restoring many tabs with security errors can get annoying (have to click through many dialogs)</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061024 Iceweasel/2.0 (Debian-2.0+dfsg-1) Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061024 Iceweasel/2.0 (Debian-2.0+dfsg-1) FF 2.0 seems to have changed default behaviour for "Security error: Domain name mismatch" popup, which defaults now to "cancel" (opposite of what it used to be). This have an implication of making my startup time 5 times more, because in the previous version I kept pressing enter zillion times, and eventually it started; now I have to read the popup, click on ok, again and again. The problem is that I get a popup for http_auth passwords (which is fine), expired ssl certs and ssl domain name mismatches. Since I have 100+ tabs open, starting FF causes some 50+ popups to open, informing me about things I am already well aware of, since I already acknowledged them when I first opened the page, before the session was in fact saved. First I would have liked to suggest to make it possible to optionally revert to the old default, but I guess some security-oversensitive fellows around may have stomped upon me and feed my remains to wild aardvarks. (No, it is not possible to convince half of the rest of the world to fix their webservers, buy IPs, renew their expired certs. I am no God. I have to work with these, that's fact, not a choice.) So I have a better suggestion: please implement a switch in the session restore feature which - if selected - would pop up only ONE popup, which would kindly inform the monkey before firefox that if I click on OK then I will get no further warnings about SSL problems (certs, mismatches, god knows what) while the session is being restored [since I already have seen these warnings anyway, and agreed to enter the site since if I would have not the site would not have been saved in the session]. I would press OK for the BigFatWarning, and the session would be restored without popups, except maybe password popups (which may, or may not be missed if there is only one stored password for the given site, and the master password was already given). It would be so nice to have this feature... but of course it must not be the default, and the user should get the warnings due after utilising this. It would be user friendly. ;-) Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open sites with expired certs, domain mismatches in 50 tabs, acknowledge every problems with OK 2. Enable session restore 3. Quit firefox 4. Start firefox Actual Results: Lots of popups [same as in step 1], some defaults to cancel [opposite of what was already chosen]. Expected Results: No popups, maybe one telling me no further popups. There is no session restore category in the bugzilla.</description>

I have been modifying hashcolouredtabs to consistently show an icon for pages that don't have their own site icon; As I have been using data uris I need to set the data in the favicon table myself which means calling setFaviconData and setFaviconUrlForPage; I can check the page is suitable by calling canAddURI, but I cannot easily check if history is currently enabled. Of course it is quite possible that, for privacy reasons, the check should actually be in setFaviconUrlForPage itself.</description>

      <title>Enhanced sidebar usability/functionality request</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0 This one is hard to explain, so I will do my best. Please bear with me. Today, when viewing the sidebar, we have a choice -- bookmarks, or history. This functionality is fine, but could be extended in a more user-friendly manner (so I think... others may disagree). Rather than having the "either-or" option, why not have the ability to have both, whereas I can have bookmarks loaded, and history directly below it (or the other way around if I feel like dragging). This option would ideally include the following: a) Display both Bookmarks and History in the sidebar, both showing at the same time but in a manner where one can resize and/or move an element via click/drag b) The option to 'close' a particular element of a sidebar (i.e. close only the History bar, but keep bookmarks still opened) c) The option to close all immediately (rather than one-by-one, so that on the next decision to open the sidebar, both are displayed in the same manner of before) d) Integration with other tools into the sidebar (JavaScript console, for example) Reproducible: Always Again, this is a feature request that would be helpful for me, and maybe others.</description>

      <title>Enhanced branching of forward and back navigation</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0 Just had an idea to make 'forward' and 'back' navigation even more powerful. Might be easier to illustrate this with a simple example - I start on page A, and then click a link (or do a search) to goto page B. I then click 'back', to view something I missed on page A, and click another link to open page C. I find what I'm looking for, but I now want to go back to page B. At the moment, this isn't possible through the standard 'back' and 'forward' buttons. When I click 'back' on page C, I am on page A, but there is no 'forward' to get to page B, as the 'forward' now takes me to C. Of course this is quite trivial in the simple example, but imagine if I went 'back' many many pages, and then forgot which page I was on originally. So - it might be nice if Firefox could store all branches of navigation that the user takes, rather than just a linear history. So when I click on the dropdown on the 'forward' button on page A, I get an option of seeing other branches that I previously took. Of course you could say that one can workaround this whole issue if on page 'A', I just open a new window or a new tab to get to page 'C', to preserve my navigational links to page 'B' - but... how many times have I accidentally just left clicked and lost my navigational link to 'B'.... then have to trawl through my history to find the entry I want.... And then think about the possible extensions of this into the History function - as well as a View By Date / Site - we could View "By Navigation" - i.e. have the user be able to see all the navigational trails that they took - this is much more intuitive than a blanket list of all pages and sites we visited - and can help to remind us about our own thought processes while navigating these sites!

      <title>OS dialogs do not use correct native theme in XP</title>
      <description>When I bring up any OS dialogs from within Minefield (e.g. the file browser dialog when you do File-&gt;Open or download something), the dialog is not correctly painted with the native Luna theme in XP. This worked correctly in Firefox 2, so I guess it's either a regression, or something that was fixed in Firefox 2 after branching. I've been seeing this for weeks now, but the latest build I've tested is "Gecko/20061215 Minefield/3.0a1", which still exhibits this behavior. Sorry if this turns out to be a dupe, but I searched for "theme" and "native" and didn't find anything that looked like this.</description>

      <title>When pasting multi-line URL in location bar, remove line breaks and surrounding spaces from link</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0 It is not an uncommon situation for me to have to paste a multi-line URL into the location bar. For instance, when people send me links via email or IM, they are often line-wrapped. Many apps, including Thunderbird stops highlighting the link on wrap (which is understandable behavior). It would be nice to just copy the multi-line link and paste it into Firefox. Firefox cuts off the paste in the location bar on new line, but a better behavior would be if it simply removed any line breaks and surrounding spaces. I can't think of a downside to this behavior and it would seem to be useful in many cases. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Copy the following URL that has been line-wrapped by some application you received it in: http://www.example.com/path/to/ test.html 2. Paste it into the location bar. Actual Results: http://www.example.com/path/to/ Expected Results: http://www.example.com/path/to/test.html</description>

Instead, only the current level is sorted; I believe this should be done recursively, and it still isn't (in either the menu or the manager) despite Bug 149690 being marked fixed. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Click Bookmarks 2. Right click on an item that isn't in a folder 3. Click "Sort By Name" Actual Results: The top/current level is sorted. Expected Results: All bookmarks are sorted with respect to the items in their current folder. I would also expect that the bookmarks be kept sorted. I filed a separate bug, Bug 364107 , about that.</description>

      <title>add drag-to-tabbar functionality for back/forward buttons and menus</title>
      <description>It should be possible to drag the back, forward, or any of the items within the back and forward menus onto the tabbar, in the same way a link can be dragged to the tabbar. For ex: dragging the back button onto an existing tab header would replace that tab with the previous page. Another ex: open forward button menu and drag an entry in between two tabs, and a new tab is created with its page set to the dragged entry. When I say "drag the button", I don't mean the actual button gets dragged. Visually, the button would stay where it is and the the cursor changes into the drag cursor (mouse pointer with grayish rectangle). (I wasn't sure the exact component this should go under - it involves toolbar buttons and the tabbar.)</description>

      <title>add notification to the end of delayedStartup() in browser.js for extensions</title>
      <description>[rfe] add notification to the end of delayedStartup() in browser.js for extensions this problem comes from patrick hunt, the primary author of the del.icio.us extension from yahoo! (https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/3615/) patrick writes: "In general we've seen problems where firefox services are not available during extension "onload" handler being called. I discussed this with Seth a few weeks ago. It would be great if mozilla could clarify what is available during code load, onload handler being called, etc... Perhaps if extensions could register observers that get called when all mozilla services have been loaded this might be a good way to handle. For example: the rdf localstore doesn't seen to be available during onload handler, you need to set a timeout to run code after onload in order to gain access to localstore." for firefox 2, for bookmarks, the bookmark service is not loaded until delayedStartup(). I know that patrick ran into this issue, and in his del.icio.us extension had to use the setTimeout() hack. trading emails with him, having a new notification at the end of delayedStartup() would solve the setTimeout() problem. I'm not sure about all the specific localstore that he mentions, however. Mark, would this be something up your alley?</description>

(https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/3615/) below are selected quotes from an email thread about this. putting it into bugzilla so that others (primarily mark finkle and robert strong) have some context. patrick writes: "is there a way to add EULA support in the XPI/installer? Basically show the eula and accept/decline buttons (whatever) during the installer dialog. Also eula support on AMO itself." about adding eula support to amo, basil and shaver wrote (a few weeks ago) that they think EULA presentation is under consideration for the next AMO revision. about client side eula, patrick writes: "I was thinking that we should package the EULA in the XPI itself. During the "install dialog" if the xpi contains a EULA the dialog could do the right thing - probably means display accept/decline buttons along with the eula text (this would have to be worked out in detail if you have interest). Nice thing about this is if you don't have a eula then the dialog is unchanged, if you do have a eula then the right thing can happen, even if the user gets the xpi from a location other than AMO (having on AMO would be great too though). " basil writes: "I just tried out an extension that does something similar - AllPeers. If I recall, it presented the EULA after install." patrick writes: "Tave to present the eula _before_ the extension is actually installed (ie running). Since our extension code doesn't start running until the extension is installed and the browser restarted it's not sufficient for them to do this (I tried). That's why I suggested adding something to the install dialog itself with the content (EULA) contained within the XPI." shaver writes: "Another issue to consider -- because I know you were dying for more! -- is whether every user on the system needs to agree, or every new profile, etc. It's an edge case for you right now, but if an extension is installed globally it's available for all users on the system, and I could see that being the case as part of some custom distribution or other software-bundling thing down the road."</description>

      <title>Scrolling pref should affect notification box "roll in" animation effect</title>
      <description>I have smooth scrolling and autoscrolling turned OFF in Firefox's Advanced options tab. Yet the Find dialog and the 'Firefox has prevented 2 popup windows from appearing' dialogs that get drawn in-window at top and bottom still painfully animate and move window content up/down as they appear/disappear. The popup 'completed downloading' alert in bottom right animates as well. I turn smooth scrolling off because it's painfully slow and irritating to watch. Don't animate ANYTHING by scrolling! Obey the user preference! Never scroll the window - if a top dialog is removed, show empty space or what's above the current user scroll position in the page in the newly-vacated space rather than moving the window content up to fill the space.</description>

Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. click irc:// URI in Firefox -&gt; ChatZilla opens the URI 2. Try to bookmark the IRC channel as a firefox bookmark Actual Results: not possible Expected Results: should get an entry somewhere. I think Firefox should integrate at least ChatZilla extension more into the UI. Because you loose data between browser and extension right now.

      <title>Complete Firefox Session Saving functionality</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.1) Gecko/20061204 Firefox/2.0.0.1 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.1) Gecko/20061204 Firefox/2.0.0.1 Currently, Firefox 2.0 has nearly-full-featured session saving functionality, including the ability to save and name/rename/edit sessions, and restore the previous session on startup. However, it is missing three things: 1. "Open All in Tabs" is misleading, particularly the "in Tabs" part. It does not suggest or imply the current behavior. Removing "in Tabs" would actually be more suggestive of the current behavior, making it appear similar to "File &gt; Open" in most programs. It should be changed, perhaps to "Open this Folder" or "Open these Tabs". 2. The "Bookmark All Tabs" menuitem should be renamed to "Save this Session". This would make it much more clear that Session saving can be done through bookmarks. 3. The ability to set Firefox to open a particular Bookmark folder on startup. Trying to delete this folder should warn the user that this will delete their next session. If they delete anyway, set the startup option to load the windows and tabs from last time. Deleting individual bookmarks in the folder should not warn, however. With these two fixed, Firefox would be a full-featured session saving browser. Reproducible: Always</description>

      <title>Address Bar for Phishing Sites should be colored red</title>

The whole address bar should be colored red in order to keep the attention of user or if a new user steps in, he will get suspicious and click on the address bar to notice that the site is phishing site. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Goto any live phishing site 2. Ignore the warning 3. The warning of a phishing site is limited to a red circle at the right end of address bar, which can be overlooked if a new user steps in. Actual Results: Only a red circle alerts the user of phishing site Expected Results: the whole address bar should be colored red to highlight the danger of the site</description>

"Bookmark this link" just isn't providing enough utility for me. I would like to see a context menu item that includes these features. I think this would involve using some of the Organize Bookmarks code or completely integrating it with the Bookmarks UI. It's very annoying to have to stop what I'm doing and run Organize Bookmarks. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.UI 2. 3. Actual Results: Have to use Bookmarks -&gt; Organize Bookmarks Expected Results: UI</description>

      <title>Add context menu to search magnifying glass for temporary engine switch</title>
      <description>The way in which I use the searchbar is that I have one search engine that I use almost exclusively. I have other engined defined, but they are all of the type that I do a single search using them and then want to go back tot he default engine for subsequent searches. I suspect a lot of people use the searchbar in this manner. It would be nice if there were a simple way in the UI to accomplish a single search using a non-default engine without changing the default search engine. The thing that finally got me to submit a bug on this was the addition of the bugzilla quick search. I now seem to often end up with the default search engine set to bugzilla and find myself accidentally searching bugzilla for things like "sd flash card". I prose adding a context menu to the magnifying glass icon on the searchbar that lists all the installed search engines. SO you could have your default search engine set to Google, type a bug number into the searchbar, right-click on the magnifying glass and select bugzilla, and that would look up the bug in bugzilla, but leave the default search engine set to Google.</description>

It's a feature request. I would like to suggest a feature to highlight words when browsing. For example, when I click Edit -&gt; Find on page... I get a Find bar in the lower part of the window, and what I type there gets highlighted. I suggest a feature like Edit -&gt; Highlight on page... and what you type in the 'text to highlight' textbox would be highlighted and would stay that was until I close the 'Highlight bar'. This is useful when you are browsing the internet and there are specific keywords you would like highlighted. Reproducible: Always See attached image that shows the current find on page feature.</description>

Therefore, I often find the need to move something I have opened in a tab to a new window by itself. Currently I have to type control N, drag the tab to the window, then close the original tab. It would be a nice enhancement if you could right click on the tab and select a 'move to new window' function. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

      <title>changing of sort order or key in History Sidebar could be clearer</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X; en-US; rv:1.8.1.1) Gecko/20061204 Firefox/2.0.0.1 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X; en-US; rv:1.8.1.1) Gecko/20061204 Firefox/2.0.0.1 After using Firefox for a while, I finally realized that I could change the sort order and key of the History sidebar by clicking on the View button, which brings up a menu. This is an odd interface. First, the View button looks to be associated with the Search field next to it. Logically, they do not make sense together, but the visual connection is very strong. One sees "Search &lt;blank&gt; View". That does not make a logical phrase. Second, there is a contextual menu in the history list view. That is probably a better place for the sorting switches. Third, the default order is by site. I would guess that this is the least common choice. It is just a guess, but ordering by last viewed is probably much more common. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. open the History sidebar in any page Actual Results: The items are sorted by name, which seems weird, and one cannot see how to change the sorting. Expected Results: The contextual menu on the history list view in the sidebar should allow me to see the sort order for the view.</description>

      <title>Printing to file can't handle pipes / filters</title>

What I am wanting to do is print to PDF format instead of Postscript (much smaller files). I would like to be able to specify something like "| ps2pdf &gt;mozilla.pdf" for the file name. This currently just creates a postscript file called "| ps2pdf &gt;mozilla.pdf"?! Thanks! Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. File.Print 2. Check "Print to file" 3. Press [Print] 4. Specify a filename beginning with a pipe, ie. "| ps2pdf &gt;mozilla.pdf" Actual Results: Created file called "| ps2pdf &gt;mozilla.pdf". Expected Results: pdf file called "mozilla.pdf" after filtering stdout through the "ps2pdf" utility in the user's path. Not quote the user-entered filename, but instead output to STDOUT if the specified filename begins with the pipe symbol.</description>

I know at the moment that you can hit the letter on the keyboard that the OPTION starts with, but in very large SELECT boxes, it can still take time to search through. For example, at the moment, if I have a list of numbers in my SELECT box, all beginning with the number 6, for example, I would just type 6 on the keyboard, and it would select the first one. What would be great however is if i could, for example, type 62 to find go to the entries starting with 62 etc etc. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: This is a suggestion. Actual Results: Suggestion.</description>

Expected Results: Should run as if closed normally before. Not present on Microsoft Windows, because Windows doesn't have UNIX signals. Could just have an empty signal callback for hangup and have it call the function used on close. http://users.evtek.fi/~tk/rtp/signals-programming.html</description>

When most people open new windows they do so to work from the SAME website, such as simulataneous Google searches or to compare different data from the same website or local folder. This is how Microsoft Internet Explorer works and one of the last reasons I have for NOT using Firefox. I'm contantly opening new windows in IE and to have to reenter a URL each time is just tedious and time consuming. Firefox users shouldn't have to reenter the previous URL (which can be long and complex) to navigate from that page in a new browser window. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Select File. 2. Select New Window. 3. Watch as everything you are viewing is destroyed. Actual Results: The new window is just my homepage. Expected Results: Open the SAME webpage.</description>

      <title>Firefox should export ICS feeds to Sunbird or another Calendar program</title>
      <description>Firefox should be able to export ICS feeds to a selected Calendar program, the same way that it handles RSS feeds. When a user clicks on a ICS link, Firefox should not ask if you want to save the calendar file to disk. Instead, Firefox should ask "what program would you like to export the feed to?". Very much the same way Firefox handles RSS feeds and exports them to various RSS readers. An ICS feed you practically the same type as an RSS, so it wouldn't be that difficult to do.</description>

      <title>Revise the Location Bar (highlight effective domain, decode URLs, add overflow ellipsis &amp; tooltip)</title>
      <description>From &lt;http://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Feature_Brainstorming:Addressbar&gt;: &gt; When nonlatin characters are used in address they are urlencoded. &gt; Many sites use them. Wikipedia is an example. But URL shown in an &gt; addressbar gets totally unreadable, like &gt; http://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%92%D1%96%D0%BA%D1%96%D0%BF%D0%B5%D0%B4%D1%96%D1%8F. &gt; &gt; Such URL is not an easy thing write down on paper for example. It would &gt; be nice if such URLs were shown more like this (the non-latin part could be &gt; highlighted or formatted to prevent phishing): &gt; http://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/Вікіпедія And: &gt; Make the domain name within the URL bold or otherwise highlighted to reduce &gt; the spoofing risks of complex URLs. Based on those suggestions, I've created the "Locationbar²" extension: http://en.design-noir.de/mozilla/locationbar2/ I tried to keep it simple (no fancy colors like some users requested) and make it useful for both novices and experienced users. Besides some early bugs that are fixed now, I got only positive responses (avg. rating on AMO is 5.0). Thus I'm asking if such an enhancement could make it into, say, Firefox 3.</description>

      <title>Drag and drop between 2 tabs within the same FF window</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.9) Gecko/20061206 Firefox/1.5.0.9 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.9) Gecko/20061206 Firefox/1.5.0.9 There are a number of things that you just can't do between two tabs within the same window in FF that you can do between separate FF windows. An example of this is something I try to do quite often when composing an email with muliple links to sites I am visiting in the tabs: i.e. dragging a URL from the location bar in tab 1 and dropping it within a text area being composed in tab 2. Currently this only works if you drag to an entirely different window, not a tab. I propose that you get this drag and drop functionality between tabs working like it does between windows. Part of the reason it doesn't work today is that when you drag something from tab 1 to tab 2 the window within tab 2 does not activate. If I drag and hoover over the 'tab' representing tab 2, tab 2's window should activate and then you should be able to proceed and drop the link wherever you want. This would be similar to the way FF currently works if you drag something from window 1 to the taskbar icon for window 2, which causes window 2 to activate and you can continue with the drop.

      <title>back/forward history menus should group similar pages</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X; en-US; rv:1.8.1.1) Gecko/20061204 Firefox/2.0.0.1 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X; en-US; rv:1.8.1.1) Gecko/20061204 Firefox/2.0.0.1 This RFE may provide a solution to allow users to navigate forward and backwards by many pages at a time without making the actual menus too large. It is in response to bug 287277, bug 282988, and bug 62010, but hopefully provides a better solution that will satisfy arguments for and against those other bugs. The situation posted by Jesse Ruderman in bug 282988 is similar to what I've run into enough times to seek out an improvement: &gt; This isn't as rare as you seem to think. Suppose I find myself at &gt; http://www.ok-cancel.com/comic/29.html and start reading the comics in reverse &gt; chronological order. Once I've read the first 29 comics, I want to go back 28 &gt; pages in session history so I can read the remaining comics in chronological &gt; order. The overall issue being that the menu on the Back button only lists the most recent 15 pages, so if I've viewed more than 15 images/comics/pages and want to go back to where I was before, I have to go to the last item in the menu multiple times to get back to what I want. A solution that I thought of that could help this particular part of the problem (seems like it's one of the very common cases in which the session history would get that long at all) is to develop some sort of grouping strategy for history entries, based on things like closeness in time viewed, similarity of URL, and similarity of page title. In Jesse's example and other ones I've run into (specifically today, photos shared on Facebook), all of the image pages have the same page title. As a user, I'll often want to go back one image, go back to the first image (as in Jesse's case), or back to the page just before the first image. If I've looked at 30 images and they all have the same page title, it's unlikely that I'll want to go back to the 18th most recent image (because I won't even remember which one that is). But wanting to go back to the oldest image or the most recent non-image both seem pretty natural. Perhaps the menu could show the fifteen most recent items like it does now, but then if those 15 items are all similar enough to be grouped (by time, URL, title, etc.), then show a separator or a '...' or something to indicate that entries are being skipped, and then show the very first (oldest) element of the group and the page right before that (the most recent page not in the group). Or, if there are only 16 or 17 images in the group, just expand the normal menu to cover those couple additional entries. Another way to handle the group of similar pages that might be even more elegant would be to place them all in a submenu, the way that bookmark folders appear in the bookmarks menu. Then the back menu shows a folder for all the similar pages as the first element, and the most recent different page as the second element, making it easy to get to the second element (but not quite as easy to get to the oldest page of the group). This certainly takes more code than just changing the size of the menu, but may serve everyone's purpose, allowing users to quickly get back to the pages they want to get back to, and preventing the menu from becoming unsightly. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Browse &gt;15 similar pages 2. Click the down arrow next to the back button Actual Results: See only the most recent 15 pages Expected Results: Be able to go back more than 15 results easily</description>

I want to get rid of the hotkey for the menu, because accesskeys and javascript key detection are more important, but when I do this I also disable the "hotkeys" for when I right-click within a page. I don't see how alt-x for the top-menu is related to right-clicking and pressing a letter. These two features should be separated into two preferences. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. visit about:config 2. set ui.key.menuAccessKey to 0 3. visit a website, and right-click on the page, a link, an image, etc Actual Results: The menu appears, but nothing is underlined, and pressing letters does nothing. Expected Results: The menu appears, and items are underlined as usual, and pressing a character triggers the appropriate action.</description>

      <title>Create about:support page with troubleshooting information (e.g. list of extensions)</title>
      <description>As discussed at &lt;http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.apps.firefox/browse_frm/thread/93d5c6843e14c2fd&gt;... Most users don't provide enough information about their setup, and we need to fish it out of them. In many cases, we need to know what extensions are installed, and there's no way to simply copy and paste that info into a support post (They would need the info-lister extension). If I need a user to do something in their profile folder (eg. restore a bookmarks backup file), I can point them to a web page that lists the default locations, but the web page can't list the exact path for that specific user. As a method of improving user support tools, it would be nice if we (support volunteers) could direct users to a single about: page, that listed all the info a user needs for user support; and create a "Copy my support info" button on that page. Originally intended as a way improving the about: page, it may be better to put this on a new 'about' URL. (about:support, about:setup, etc.) Filed under Firefox:General, but if this could be done in the Toolkit, and make it so Thunderbird users could also utilize a support info-lister, that would be twice as nice. :-) Some info that it would include: - version - user-agent sting - installed add-ons (and their version numbers) - installed plug-ins (and their version numbers) - profile location - and maybe the cache location</description>

Quite a common task for me is to adjust minimum font size for pages. For some reason it does not work as I'd expect it directly via the font size selector in preferences. I have to go to "advanced", play around with the minimum font size there. I still wonder what the font size on toplevel is good for. Not that I am actually interested in help on that, it is more that somehow the logic seems mixed up when an override is placed lower in the hirarchy. |--&gt; settings that apply to all fonts (whole page) |--------&gt; special font settings (parts of page) Or to put it in other words. A page that is not readable because over all font size is too small should be a major concern for the programmer compared to the adjustement of a special font type. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

      <title>Search text should be deleted right after I've searched for it</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.0.7) Gecko/20060830 Firefox/1.5.0.7 (Debian-1.5.dfsg+1.5.0.7-2) Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.0.7) Gecko/20060830 Firefox/1.5.0.7 (Debian-1.5.dfsg+1.5.0.7-2) Say I need to search for the word foo in google/any other search engine. So I copy&amp;paste word foo into search bar, then press enter. It searches ok, I've read the results and now back to browsing. Google/search engine page closed. Ok, now I have to search for another word. I try to copy&amp;paste it, but the foo word is still there, and makes me deleting it manually BEFORE I would start any new search. Unfortunately starting new tab doesn't help removing it. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Put some word to serach bar (say foo). 2. Press enter. 3. Close search tab. 4. Enjoy. Actual Results: Word foo is still in the search bar, blocking me from searching immediately for another word. Expected Results: Word foo disappears and I can search without any additional steps</description>

      <title>Make Live-Bookmarks preview show full title</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.1) Gecko/20061204 Firefox/2.0.0.1 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.1) Gecko/20061204 Firefox/2.0.0.1 When using Live-Bookmarks, usually in the toolbar, a simple click shows the titles of all the latest items as a sort of preview. Today the width of the preview window is fixed, so long titles are only partially displayed. This forces users to click on them to see, whether the article could be interesting. Since in this usecase only a single preview window is open at any time, this issue could easily be fixed by allowing the preview window to expand to the width necessary to display the longest title. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Click on a Live-Bookmark in the Bookmark-Toolbar. 2. Read some titles. 3. Notice that long titles are truncated. Actual Results: Long titles are displayed only partially. Expected Results: The preview window should expand to show any title at full length.</description>

      <title>Ctrl+bksp / Ctrl+del on GTK Widgets deletes too much?</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9a2pre) Gecko/20070206 Minefield/3.0a2pre Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; FreeBSD i386; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061201 Firefox/2.0 On Win32, Control+Backspace deletes a "word". GTK does this too, but "words" are delimited differently. In Windows/Aqua, words are defined as one or more alphanumerics followed by zero or more nonalphanumerics. In gtk/qt, words are defined as one more more nonwhitespace followed by zero or more whitespace. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Enter a URL into the Location Bar (e.g. https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Firefox&amp;format=guided ) 2. Press End to move your cursor to the end/deselect the entire URL 3. Press Control+Backspace Actual Results: On linux, the resulting URL will be blank. Expected Results: In windows and OSX(camino, alt+backspace), the resulting URL will be: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Firefox&amp;format= It's not really a bug, it just makes it annoying to use firefox on linux when I'm used to windows. And it's convenient when you want to delete part of a URL, not the whole thing. Maybe it shouldn't be the default behavior, but there should be a way to get the same results on both platforms. Maybe there could be something in about:config to adjust this behavior on the XUL widgets? The same behavior occurs with control+delete, but with the following 'word' instead of the preceding.</description>

      <title>Add protocol / file handler registry keys in HKEY_CURRENT_USER to workaround apps that read reg keys directly</title>
      <description>It turns out that some applications (e.g. Yahoo IM) read the file and protocol handler registry keys to launch the default http, etc. handler as reported in bug 359643. Since Vista uses a new methodology for setting the default handler that does not set these keys apps that do this will not launch the actual default handler unless the default handler has also updated the associated registry keys. We can accomplish this by also setting the associated registry keys under HKEY_CURRENT_USER on Vista when setting ourselves as the default handler using the new method provided by Vista.</description>

Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.install firefox-qs (guru,...) 2.make it start on boot 3.reboot Actual Results: On every bootup the user is asked whether he wants to restore some previous firefox session. Expected Results: 1.) Firefox-QS should be able to start firefox in plain mode without any content and without prompting the user for anything 2.) Termination of Firefox instances still running in plain mode (no site opened) should not trigger session restoration It would be possible to do totally without FirefoxQS if the main /usr/bin/firefox executable was a dummy program just checking if any instance of Firefox is already running. If yes it should make the running instance fork: Just as if the user selecet File-&gt;NewWindow If not it should start firefox-bin.</description>

      <title>Dialog for POSTDATA resubmission confirmation is ambiguous when Session Store restores many tabs</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.2) Gecko/20070208 Firefox/2.0.0.2 The "Confirm" dialog that appears, when POSTDATA is to be resent, is no longer adequate for current and future incarnation of Firefox (esp. since the introduction of session resuming). The dialog should be enhanced to indicate what site (name and URL) the dialog applies to. Ever since the ability to reload a prior session, whether after a crash or as per routine preference, there are many instances whereby several tabs being restored trigger the POSTDATA confirmation. While this is happening, it is difficult to know what website is at issue and, therefore, what type of data is potentially going to be resubmitted. It is ambiguous. Say I get three POSTDATA dialog boxes, which is going where? This is particularly difficult -- even with just one dialog -- when restoring a session having many tabs. All the current dialog states is: "The page you are trying to view contains POSTDATA that has expired from cache. If you resend the data, any action the form carried out (such as a search or online purchase) will be repeated. To resend the data, click OK. Otherwise, click Cancel." &lt;-- This is ambiguous. An enhancement that includes both the title and URL of the web page, at a minimum, would be most welcome. If the web URL is very long, ellipses could be used in the manner, "https:\\www.anecommercesite.tld\...\confirmpurchase.asp" Thanks Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

      <title>visually indicate on tab those pages whose input form has been modified/changed</title>
      <description>To avoid dataloss before closing a window or closing a tab (that is not in foreground) need to know which tabs have form data that was started but has not been committed. With this feedback one can revisited those tabs to finish the input and commit. Input being selections made and data in text input areas. My guess is the indication must be on tab via border, icon, shading, whatever - I don't see something outside the tab area being sufficient. perhaps the tab's status could be derived from info/pieces already there from session restore's infrastructure (status/data/capabilities).

This arrow would point to the top-left corner of the area I have seen already, like the horizontal line in Unix gv(1) does. I think a diagonal arrow, as shown below in crude ASCII art, would work well: \ \ &gt; Or, instead, it could be a horizontal arrow pointing to the first new unread line of the page.

      <title>Cannot easily select alternative helper applications in "Open With" dialog</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; cs-CZ; rv:1.8.0.9) Gecko/20070213 Fedora/1.0.7-0.6.0.1.fc5 SeaMonkey/1.0.7 Build Identifier: Fedora/firefox-1.5.0.9-2.fc6 Note: this is a dupe of https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=227374 If someone right-clicks a file on, say, their GNOME desktop, they see an "Open With" menu that shows all the applications registered to handle files of that MIME type. However, if they click on that same file on a web site with firefox, they only get a single choice of application with which to handle it, plus the option of manually browsing to a path. They no longer see the same list of relevant applications. Example scenario where this may pose a usability problem: User is accustomed to opening PDF files with "Document Viewer" (evince). Then Adobe Reader gets installed on the system, replacing evince as the default app for pdf files. The user is more familiar with evince and prefers to keep using it. For local files this is not a serious problem: they right-click on the file and choose "Document Viewer" from the "Open With" menu. However, for pdf files on the web, the option of opening the file with Document Viewer has, from the user's perspective, completely been taken away from them. The only items on the "Open With" menu are "Adobe Reader" and manually browsing to find an application. If they are a novice user, they may not know that "Document Viewer" = "/usr/bin/evince" and will not be able to find their old preferred application. It would be much better if firefox's "open with" menu matched the "open with" menu a user sees for local files. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Select a link to a downloadable file. 2. Observe the list of applications presented in the "How do you want to handle this file?" dialog. 3. Compare with the list of applications in the "Open With" menu if that file is stored locally and is right-clicked-on inside the GNOME file browser. Actual Results: Firefox only shows the default application, not any other applications registered for that MIME type. The GNOME file browser's "Open With" menu shows them all. Expected Results: It would be nice if firefox showed them all as options. I have created a patch which implements this suggested enhancement. However, I have never even looked at the firefox/mozilla source code before now, so I do not know enough about the firefox internals to create a patch that is as efficient and fully featured as I would like. Also, I'm not 100% confident that my memory/pointer handling is all correct (the firefox code convention learning curve is pretty steep!) I think I've avoided any inappropriate free's but there may be some memory leaks. However, the patch should be a starting point for someone more familiar with firefox internals to look over and modify. Basically, what I've done is as follows. Since I don't know enough to be able to change the format or structure of any data files (such as mimeTypes.rdf), I've simply altered the code so that, when useSystemDefault is selected, it doesn't just use "the" default application -- rather, it looks at the preferredApplicationHandler field and if that matches one of the other apps registered for the mime type, that app is used instead. Then, the dialogs where the user is asked to select the app are augmented with the addition of these other apps, and if the user selects one of them the code will put the app into preferredApplicationHandler but also set useSystemDefault. If the user selects the real default application the code will clear preferredApplicationHandler along with setting useSystemDefault. I've added one attribute and two methods to the nsIMIMEInfo interface: an attribute holding the number of alternative system applications, and methods for getting the description and path of these alternative apps. I realize a patch like this really belongs upstream, but I see that most of the linux-compatibility work on firefox is actually being done by RedHat so I figured here might be the best place to post it after all. I hope someone more familiar with firefox internals than I am can take this patch and rework it into something efficient and correct and fully conforming to firefox code conventions.</description>

      <title>Cannot view or change download actions due to lack of extensions</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; cs-CZ; rv:1.8.0.9) Gecko/20070213 Fedora/1.0.7-0.6.0.1.fc5 SeaMonkey/1.0.7 Build Identifier: Fedora/firefox-1.5.0.9-2.fc6 Note: this is a dupe of https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=227372 If a user checks the "Do this automatically from now on" box when opening a downloaded file with a helper application, there is no apparent way to ever reverse that decision. The indicated action does not appear when you click "View/Edit Actions" in the Downloads preferences -- indeed, that list is always empty. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: Steps to Reproduce: 1. Start with default firefox configuration on a new Fedora Core installation (make sure user does not have a preexisting mimeTypes.rdf file). 2. Click on a link to a pdf file. 3. Select a helper application. 4. Check the "Do this automatically from now on" box. 5. Complete the download. 6. Go to Edit-&gt;Preferences, select Downloads tab, and click on View/Edit Actions. Actual Results: You see an empty list, with no way to undo or reverse the selection of automatically using that helper application for pdf files. Expected Results: You should see a list containing your selected helper application for pdf files, with the option to edit or remove that automatic action. The reason is because GNOME has now deprecated all functions that return extensions for MIME types, and firefox is configured by default to hide all actions for MIME types without extensions. Firefox calls gnome_vfs_mime_get_extensions_list (in mozilla/uriloader/exthandler/unix/nsGNOMERegistry.cpp) to get the list of extensions for a MIME type. However, in current versions of GNOME that function is hardcoded to always return NULL, so all MIME types now have an empty extension list in firefox (except for ones left over in a user's mimeTypes.rdf file from running previous versions of firefox with earlier versions of GNOME). The firefox configuration by default sets the "browser.download.hide_plugins_without_extensions" preference (which applies to helper apps as well as to plugins). Therefore, all actions are hidden and the user cannot reverse or undo the action. I have attached a patch which alleviates the problem by removing the default setting of browser.download.hide_plugins_without_extensions, as well as removing the "Extensions" column from the initial view of the action list (though the user can add it back again using the column picker) and using the file type description instead of extension as the primary field. This won't solve the problem for anyone who has explicitly set browser.download.hide_plugins_without_extensions in their user preferences file, so the real solution is probably to change the code to ignore that setting. Alternatively, one could come up with an alternative method for getting a list of extensions, but presumably GNOME made a deliberate choice to remove this functionality so there is presumably a good reason for it and it is probably better to adapt firefox-for-unix to no longer rely on extensions. Of course, firefox for windows will still need them, so any patch will have to be unix-specific (or maybe even linux-specific) with appropriate #ifdef's if pushed into the upstream firefox tree. I don't know enough about firefox development to know what those #ifdefs should be, so have not attempted such a patch.</description>

Search is much more natural way of navigation. This means that user shouldn't bother to think of URLs, but just to type in what he wants, and URL should retrive information from search engine, bookmarks and history, and show it in the drop down box. Of course, if someone puts URL in such box (which should change address bar), it should be easily recognizable, and Firefox should go to exact that address. I really prefer such way of navigating the Internet when I visit the site that I am sure to be on top of Google's results. That is mostly in the case when it is some brand name, institution, etc... Unfortunatly it doesn't work for the sites I visit frequently, so I must remember their URLs and sort through them, which is far from necessary.

This would nicely integrate with most graphical mail clients, it would be useful for anyone looking to store contact information without too much cut'n'paste, and it would give web developers another incentive to use semantic markup.

It's a pretty common problem for users and it really doesn't feel right, and it seems nasty for people to have to get out a shell to fix something that should just work. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3. Expected Results: A prefernce setting for the same options that FIREFOX_DSP drives.</description>

The bookmark meta-data should include its source 2. The bookmark comment should be initialised to any selected text nor, 3. The bookmark keywords should be initialised to the page's meta tags The source could be the more specific of: a. The URL of the page I am one b. The referer sent with the request for that page Adding a source field would mean changing the Bookmarks manager, and is perhaps going to need more consideration, but the other two look to be quite easy to implement. Are there known barriers to enhancing the ability to locate bookmarked pages, and do more with them when found? See Bug 24829 "RFE: Store bookmarks as images, too..."

Now, there exist SyncML bookmarks but they're not really used. With SyncML bookmarks servers and services, like the one provided by http://mobical.net , users could easily sync their bookmarks with other browsers supporting SyncML but also Over-The-Air from their mobile device. We do really need a solution for bookmarks synchronization based on an open-standard. Cheers. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: N.A Actual Results: N.A.</description>

For example, clicking on a link like &lt;a href="http://user:passwd@foo.com"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt; will issue a warning: Confirm You are about to log into the site "foo.com" with the username "xx" Cancel/OK however, no such warning occurs with a tag containing a src attribute, like &lt;img src=""http://user:passwd@foo.com"&gt; Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Find a site secured with HTTP password authentification 2. At a different site, create a webpage including the code: &lt;img src="http://user:password@foo.com"&gt; where user and password are a valid username and a valid password for the secured site. 3. Navigate to that webpage 4. Navigate to the secured site Actual Results: You will be logged into the secured site without a user/login box. Expected Results: After step 3, a warning message box with the text: Confirm You are about to log into the site "foo.com" with the username "user" Cancel/OK src tags normally retrieve information but can be abused to manipulate a server, for example with cgi commands. This would prevent unathorized acess to sensitive servers. For example this would prevent intrusion into a home router (See bug # 371598) See also bug # 38933</description>

Or, find out how to tell what AddOns are actually running at the time, and loaded with FireFox? Expected Results: No error in BritishEnglish dictionary / Spellchecker ps, none of the language dictionaries / spell checkers seem to be able to cope with words from other languages, even though the other dictionaries appear to be loaded: why is there not an option to spellcheck against a group of dictionaries, this is really needed for European users who tend to use several languages quite often..unlike the USofA, the EU has loads and loads of different languages! There is no workaround for this, it can be a real pain.</description>

      <title>Left clicking a link should never open new tabs or windows</title>

I think that it is perfectly normal to think that if user left clicked it is safe to suppose that he wanted link to be opened in the same tab, and if he middle clicked, that he wanted link to be opened into new tab, and that Firefox should follow user command and *ignore* what web developer thinks is right. The exception could be javascript pop-ups that resize window, as this is something that user cannot decide, and it is reasonable to follow web developer's decision concerning this.

      <title>No tab parent set when link opened in background (middle-click, context menu)</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8.1.2) Gecko/20070219 Firefox/2.0.0.2 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8.1.2) Gecko/20070219 Firefox/2.0.0.2 The intelligent tab order used when browser.tabs.selectOwnerOnClose is set to true seems to be broken. When clicking a link on a web page via middle click (CMD+click on a mac) or context menu (open link in new tab) and closing it again (close button/CMD+W) the tab isn't set to the originating one but to the tab next to the closed one. Contrary, if the specified link is just clicked with the left mouse button (and has target=_blank / unknown target set), closing the new tab DOES select the owner on close correctly. The problem seems to have surfaced with the update to 2.0.0.2. I've recreated this behavior on OS X 10.4.9 (PPC) with a new profile and all extensions disabled. Additionally, I've tried several web sites to see if it is affected by page content, but it seems like this isn't a site/source code-specific problem. Since I'm unable to test this one on Windows, I've set HW/OS to Mac/OS X. If Windows users can reproduce this bug, please edit the entry accordingly. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open link in web page via CMD+click or "Open Link in New Tab" 2. When new tab appears, close it via CMD+W or the close button b) Do as in a) but open link with &lt;a target&gt; set to an unused name. Actual Results: a) On close, the tab next to (as in displayed tab order) the recently closed tab is selected. b) On close, the tab from which the link originated is selected. Expected Results: In a) the active tab should've been set to the parent tab.</description>

While you can move (or save) a bookmarks.html file in its entirety (i.e. all), or save 1 bookmark (usually via drop-n-drag to the desktop), it is not possible to save as sub-set of bookmarks to the desktop (OS, file system, whatever you want to call outside of Firefox). This means I have no easy way to move a bookmark group from one computer to another or send a bookmark group to a friend. So what is needed is an export/import feature for bookmark groups. I assume you would either save the group as an XML file, an HTML file that is a mini version of bookmarks.html, or a folder of saved bookmarks (in Windows *.url). These are just three ways I can think of saving the bookmark group. While drag-n-drop from the Bookmark Manager or menu would be nice, a right-clock menu option would also work.

Please get rid of the drop down menu and the expansion dohicky and instead: Have current tree/folder widget be made resizable Have the dialog window be resizable. That should take care of the people who want to keep the window short, and take care of the people who want it expanded, and take care of the people who want it really really expanded. It reduces the number of elements in the add bookmark dialog box, and it avoids the current duplication of the dropdown and list. Thanks for your time --Aaron Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.Create new bookmark 2. try to save bookmark in a nested folder... 3. click expando dodad 4. repeat, having to click expando doodad, and navigate through nested bookmarks until found right location. Actual Results: Frustration, tired finger, worn out mouse. Expected Results: 1.click create bookmark 2.select folder 3. hit ok This might.. be in the real of hack that I can handle.. so assign the bug to me if you hate the idea and I'll try to make an extension demonstrating it.. (Might be a while though before I get to it) btw, I added all of the keywords that I searched with in my short description, which resulted in not finding another copy of this.. It may look redundant, but it's there to aid in reducing duplicate bugs.</description>

That was even in cases of sessions that had not crashed. Where can I find this option in the latter version? The reason for having this is in cases where the last tab list wasn't saved right or only if one would like to go back to a list of tabs that was not bookmarked or in cases of session crash, you mistakingly hit the do not restore button and would like to get back your last session from a virgin firefox window.

This is because many users do not know jnlp at all, and the popped download window totally confuses them. Direct executing is the default behavior in IE and opera. The security is not a issue since jnlp's execution needs user's confirmation. If java is not installed, the browser should be directed to a java plugin's installation page.

This was no longer included with Firefox by default in favour of including these search capabilities in the Search box feature. This however is not as good as the keyword as it requires a mouse click (or Press F4, then up/down)to select an alternative search engine which is more time consuming and not as 'quick' as going to the actual search engine website to do it. The feature enhancement request is to move the 'Bookmark Keyword' feature to apply to the Quick Search, and for the Quick Searches bundled by default to include the keyword, and for engines added later to also include a keyword if the addon was configured for one. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.Select the Location Bar 2. type in "g firefox" 3. Press Enter Actual Results: Firefox searches the the website "g", and when that fails over it searches Google for "g firefox" Expected Results: Firefox searches Google for the term "firefox"</description>

      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9a4pre) Gecko/20070327 Minefield/3.0a4pre Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9a4pre) Gecko/20070327 Minefield/3.0a4pre In Windows, if I go to the Control Panel and set Mouse Properties to "Automatically move pointer to the default button in a dialog box" then go to do various things in Firefox, the mouse pointer does not move to the 'default' button when dialog pop-ups appear. FYI, IE7 behaves as expected in these respects. Robbie Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Opt to have the mouse pointer move to default button (Control Panel &gt; Mouse &gt; Pointer Options &gt; Automatically move pointer to the default button in a dialog box. 2. Use any feature in Firefox which results in a dialog pop-up appearing with a default button (eg: Tools &gt; Options or close the browser when multiple tabs are open). Actual Results: Mouse pointer remains where it was last positioned. Expected Results: Mouse pointer should move over the 'default' (ie: highlighted) button.</description>

      <title>"Already running" error dialog should tell user what URL was requested (if any)</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1.2) Gecko/20060601 Firefox/2.0.0.2 (Ubuntu-edgy) Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1.2) Gecko/20060601 Firefox/2.0.0.2 (Ubuntu-edgy) Let's say I'm using my standalone feed reader (LiFeRea, in this case, but doesn't matter) and click on a bunch of items, expecting them to open in the existing Firefox window. If my system is laggy, I might click a number of links very quickly, and a number of seconds after I've marked those as read and moved on to other feed items, I get the dreaded message: "Firefox is already running, but is not responding. To open a new window, you must first close the existing Firefox process, or restart your system." Sometimes several of these will appear. Now, since viewing a feed item marks it as read, I don't know for which items I've clicked "Read More" and not received an open tab. The dialog box should *at least* display the URL that was requested (if any), even *better* could display it as copy-able text, and *ideally* would offer to retry the URL.

      <title>Download Manager uses API function CopyFile to replace existing files. Better use ReplaceFile to preserve security settings of the already existing file.</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de; rv:1.8.1.3) Gecko/20070309 Firefox/2.0.0.3 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de; rv:1.8.1.3) Gecko/20070309 Firefox/2.0.0.3 If you download a file you will be warned if the file already exists. If you decide to do so the file will be replaced. It seems that the file is overwritten by calling CopyFile(x ,y , FALSE). The problem is that the new file does not inherit the security descriptor that is already applied to the existing file. Better use the API function ReplaceFile in this scenario since it will preserve all NTFS settings of the old file. Example for IIS directories: There is a file special.htm that is located in the inetpub directory. This file has special NTFS settings applied. If you overwrite this file with the firefox download manager the special NTFS settings are lost which can lead to security compromise if this is not noticed. By using the ReplaceFile function these settings would have been preserved. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. apply special NTFS settings to local file 2. download file with same name 3. choose to overwrite existing file Actual Results: NTFS settings have changed to default values that have been inherited from the directory. Old NTFS settings are lost. Expected Results: NTFS settings of the old file should be preserved</description>

      <description>allow for standard way for content (for example, a permalink) to be blogged / shared / digg'd, etc. I'm including things like digg and reddit here, but that might be something else. this could be a microformat, so that content authors could add semantic data to permalinks, and then when handling that microformat, we'd launch the users blog to create a new post. see also phil's "blog this" add-on, https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/261 and the "BlogThis" button in the google toolbar (http://toolbar.google.com/button_help.html) and clip-to-blog http://clipmarks.com/clip-to-blog/ One sticky point is that people often have multiple blog, and I'm not sure how that would work. Although in mkaply's Operator add-on, you can have multiple consumers for the same microformat. alex, dan and I chatted about this yesterday, and this bug is for continuing the discussion. originally we discussed a "share://" protocol, but now I'm thinking microformats is the right solution.</description>

It happens more at busy times of the day or week and where either my own machine or the target is busy. The cause is probably the fact that my machine "impatiently" gives up on getting a response from either a name server, the target site, or both. While tips on making my machine more "patient" in these regards would help, sometimes I have to use a machine on which I don't have root access. So it would alleviate a major annoyance if I could set the browser to silently retry each request until it completes, or until I manually kill the browser process.

      <title>Places history should be split up into host list and table for each host (for better performance)</title>
      <description>Actual, all page visits are stored into one table and the typed-in user input is compared to all history entries. For increasing the performance, Firefox should check first for matching host names and then receive the history entries for the matching hosts. So autocomplete would speed up and perform better, allowing to store the history longer and allowing the use of the matching hosts in the autocomplete (with tab-autocomplete or drop-down). Sorting the on collecting is more efficient than sorting on each user input.</description>

This would be an enhanced version of Locationbar2 (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4014) offering the ultimate phishing protection by turning bookmarks into petnames instead of lambda names (see http://www.skyhunter.com/marcs/petnames/IntroPetNames.html). For example, say you have a bookmark pointing to http://www.paypal.com with the keyword "paypal". You want to make a purchase using Paypal and click a link from another site which takes you to https://example.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr. Now in the locationbar is displayed "example.paypal/cgi-bin/webscr". The locationbar would choose between multiple bookmarks for the same domain hierarchically. So if you had a second bookmark "paypal-secure" pointing to https://example.paypal.com/ then the locationbar would instead display "paypal-secure/cgi-bin/webscr". A third bookmark "paypal-secure-payment" pointing to https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr would result in the locationbar displaying "paypal-secure-payment". This bug depends on bug 237180. Some additions are probably required: 1. Some kind of visual indication to show that you have bookmarked the site 2. Usage of bookmark title for bookmarks without keywords. However this is much more complicated because multiple bookmarks with different URLs but the same title would have to be detected. These could be distinguished by their parent bookmark category/categories, or failing that, a number (ugly but the only alternative would be to disallow multiple bookmarks with different URLs and same name in the same folder). Same issue using tags instead of folders. Reproducible: Always</description>

If you are familiar with Opera, you will know immediately what I am talking about, namely "remembering" the last set of tabs that were open / being used when Opera was closed; not abnormally closed, but simply closed. I would like to suggest mozilla consider incorporating this into firefox to even remember (presumably cached??) the set of tabs that were open when firefox is simply closed, not forceably closed on a crash, etc. Opening with the previously open tabs can be a user selected option when firefox is launched. I know we can go back thru a laundry list of history to do the same thing. but caching this list of URLs is a lot quicker and more user friendly. I like firefox and it is the browser I use the most. Thanks for a great product.

      <title>&lt;label&gt; should work with other things than simple text</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1.3) Gecko/20070309 Firefox/2.0.0.3 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1.3) Gecko/20070309 Firefox/2.0.0.3 It would be very useful if the &lt;label&gt; tag for radios and checkboxes worked when it contained other things than simple text. For example it is reasonable to make a whole div clickable using a label. The w3c recommendation at http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/interact/forms.html#h-17.9.1 does not say anything about restricting the &lt;label&gt; tag to only work with simple text. For the purpose I would like to use labels, it would be nice if I could wrap a whole &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt; in a &lt;label&gt;&lt;/label&gt;. See also the test case I will attach in a moment. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

      <title>Font kerning support (TTF embedded kerning information)</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-GB; rv:1.8.1.3) Gecko/20070309 Firefox/2.0.0.3 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-GB; rv:1.8.1.3) Gecko/20070309 Firefox/2.0.0.3 True type fonts have embedded kerning information within them. This information is currently not being used by Firefox when rendering the fonts. The CSS Text Level 3 Working Draft 6 March 2007 mentions support for "Fullwidth Punctuation Kerning: the 'punctuation-trim' property" but leaves kerning support to the Fonts module ("'kerning-mode: contextual' has been replaced with 'punctuation-trim: adjacent'. Any further controls for kerning will likely be delegated to the Fonts module.") The Font module (CSS3 module: Fonts; Working Draft 2 August 2002) is still quiet about kerning as of today. I suggest full kerning support for True Type Fonts in Gecko 2.0 for Firefox 4.0. Comments in the following article (http://blog.wired.com/underwire/2007/04/the_math_behind.html) are suggested reading, in particular the following two comments: http://blog.wired.com/underwire/2007/04/the_math_behind.html#comment-67133010 Sorry, many of the posters here are wrong: most of the current browsers do not do kerning. You are confusing kerning with proportional fonts. Try this: AVAVAVAVAV AAAAAVVVVV If your browser does kerning, and the fonts has kerning info, the two strings should NOT have equal width. Now try this in MS Word. Still equal. Then select "Format" -&gt; "Font" -&gt; "Character Spacing" tab, check "Kerning for fonts" and choose a small size (let's say 3 points and above). Words will start doing kerning. Then try various fonts. Arial and Times New Roman have kerning info. Arial Unicode MS does not. http://blog.wired.com/underwire/2007/04/the_math_behind.html#comment-67152188 Mihai is correct; browsers generally don't respect kerning information. If you have a Mac and Safari with the debug menu enabled, you can get a dramatic demonstration of that by just turning on the "Use ATSU text" option, reloading the page, and watching what happens to the AAAAVVVV strings posted above. In addition to that, browsers have lousy justification algorithms and none of them, as far as I know, have hyphenation algorithms. (Firefox won't even respect manual "hinting" with the soft hyphen entity!) Reproducible: Always</description>

      <title>event.layerX/Y This is relative to layer where event occour or layer where event was captured???</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; ru; rv:1.8.1.3) Gecko/20070309 Firefox/2.0.0.3 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; ru; rv:1.8.1.3) Gecko/20070309 Firefox/2.0.0.3 http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/DOM:event says that: event layerX/layerY returns the horizontal coordinate of the event relative to the CURRENT layer. Documentation does not clear next question: Current layer where event occour or layer where event was captured??? After some test I realize that "current layer" means layer where event occour - "originalTarget". layerX/layerY are relative to this layer, not layer where event captured. But next test with table shows that layerX/layerY are relative to "currentTarget" not for "originalTarget" so layerX/layerY seems to be ugly Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. &lt;div style="position: absolute; width: 100px; height: 100px;"&gt; &lt;divstyle="position: absolute; left: 50px; top: 50px; width: 10px; height: 10px;"&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; 2. subscribe to 'mouseover' event for first div Actual Results: console.log( event.layerX, event.layerY ) for second div shows layerX: 0 to 10, layerY: 0 to 10 Expected Results: console.log( event.layerX, event.layerY ) for second div must show layerX: 50 to 60, layerY: 50 to 60. See 'left', 'top' properties May be that will be use full if you add two properties like: originalLayerX/originalLayerY So in my example I get next result: originalLayerX: 5 originalLayerY: 5 layerX: 55 layerY: 55</description>

Or have an about:config option to enable this? Or allow the microsummary generator to enable it? I think that would be quite useful for quickly changing information you only rarely need. (E.g. the song currently playing on the radio.) Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. In the Bookmarks menu, open a folder with live titles. Actual Results: The information can be up to a minute old even with the fastest possible updateInterval setting, and get downloaded every minute when I don't need it. Expected Results: The information should not reload every minute, it should just reload when I need it.</description>

      <title>remember the value of the text zoom setting on a site-specific basis</title>
      <description>Most of the time, when users use the "text zoom" setting to change the size of text on a web page, they'd like to see the same size text the next time they visit that page, and in many cases they'd like that size to apply to all pages on the site they're browsing, not just that particular page. But the setting currently only applies on a tab-specific basis. Once a user closes a tab, their preference is lost, and when they return to that site they have to reset the setting to their preferred value. The text zoom setting would be more useful Firefox remembered its value on a site-specific basis and would restore the value when users revisit sites on which they'd previously set a text zoom.</description>

But it worked well in Firefox 1.x! For example if I double clicked by finger on touchpad and held last finger click for about 2 seconds - context menu appeared (like after right mouse click). If I double clicked + held over a hyperlink - context menu appeared with "open in new tab" option (and other options), that is quite useful when you're working with notebook without mouse.

      <description>I have a feeling there is a duplicate bug for this, but I can't find it. The closest is bug 345378, but that covers the all tabs menu which I believe is a bad choice. I have managed to overhaul the tab tooltip so that the user can get the page title, URL and a generated preview at a glance. Hover over any tab and you get a preview of it.

Many users search for a way to avoid annoying (JavaScript) pop up also when they are legitimate. The solution is to set this value to 0 instead of default 2. This force all new windows opened by JavaScript into tabs. The problems is that only advanced user know how to obtain this result. Adding the ability to change it from Tools - Options will spread this useful feature. As an addition: Right click - "Force this JavaScript link in a new tab/Open this tab in the original window" is an idea to easily do/undo this task if one doesn't want change the default but only occasionally use the 0 value.

      <title>Winstripe background tabs polish</title>
      <description>Created attachment 264455 [details] screenshot without background color (In reply to bug 350690 comment 85) &gt; (In reply to bug 350690 comment 80) &gt; &gt; (In reply to bug 350690 comment 77) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I like https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=237225 more than &gt; &gt; &gt; https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=237224, as I like having just &gt; &gt; &gt; the selected tab be lighter. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I agree that having the selected tab lighter is good, but not at the expense of &gt; &gt; having the background tabs disappear into the tabstrip. One of the goals of the &gt; &gt; redesign of the tabstrip was to have the background tabs (on both platforms) be &gt; &gt; visually distinct from the tabstrip - I feel they're too transparent in the &gt; &gt; first one. &gt; &gt; From the screenshots I had agreed with Seth, but after testing on Linux I think &gt; I agree with Jay. I actually can't easily tell where my background tabs are or &gt; how many I have with the current patch on this. I then tried testing with the &gt; dialog color behind everything, but I think I screwed up the patch, because it &gt; didn't do what I wanted :). So I'd like to see a patch that puts the dialog &gt; color behind everything; I think that would perhaps be better. I think this needs re-evaluation, as the tabstrip's background images was changed afterwards (bug 350689).</description>

      <title>Hard to find a processor-intensive tab among many tabs</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X; en-US; rv:1.8.1.3) Gecko/20070309 Firefox/2.0.0.3 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X; en-US; rv:1.8.1.3) Gecko/20070309 Firefox/2.0.0.3 I usually have a LOT of tabs open at once across multiple virtual desktops. Once in a while I end up on a page that has some sort of advertisement (most likely flash) that makes my processor go absolutely nuts; it spikes up to 100% and just stays there. Finding that tab to close it and get my computer back to normal is a pain! It would be really great to somehow get a dialog listing all the tabs and the relative amount of work each is doing. That way I can close that one tab quickly and without having to experiment by closing tabs that i'm not quite done with. Reproducible: Sometimes Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open many tabs 2. End up on a page that has some processor intensive task on it 3. Lose the tab among your sea of open tabs 4. Watch your CPU spike and then try to figure out what tab is the culprit. 5. Learn that trying to get FF to behave was a good way to clean up your open tabs. ;) Actual Results: Frustrating to find processor intensive tab; end up having to close a lot of useful tabs in order to find the misbehaving one. Expected Results: It would be great to have a global view of all tabs and how much work they are doing to close it out.</description>

      <title>Bookmarks: Sort by Name but respect separators</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1.3) Gecko/20061201 Firefox/2.0.0.3 (Ubuntu-feisty) Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1.3) Gecko/20061201 Firefox/2.0.0.3 (Ubuntu-feisty) The existing "Sort by Name" function should be duplicated and modified to respect separators. By this, I mean that bookmarks between separators should be sorted amongst themselves only and remain between the separators, which should not be removed. The existing functionality deletes all separators within the current context and sorts the real items as one big group - introducing chaos. The new function should use the separators to "group" the items within the context, sort each group independently and then append the groups together with single-separator divisions. (only extraneous separators should be deleted) The new function should be provided as an option in addition to the existing one. (I suggest a menu item named "Sort by Name (respect separators)") I have investigated the implementation of "Sort by Name" and I am willing to develop this new feature as my first bug. It's fairly elementary (based on my investigation) and it is a feature that I would use myself. This makes it a good point of entry into the Mozilla Firefox project. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: Take a look at the bookmarks feature. Actual Results: The lack of this feature is clearly obvious. Expected Results: N/A As I said, I'm interested in contributing this change as my first code-contribution to Firefox.</description>

I use it all the time! Much like ALT F gets me into ff's menu system, I'd love to be able to browse my own menu system from my keyboard. I know I can ALT B into the Bookmarks menu and that the toolbar folder is accessible from there, but that's not as useful, since the orientation is flipped. I most often add to the toolbar by dragging directly onto it, and I have a pretty clear mental map of where stuff is, but sometimes I know more or less where something is, but forget what it's called. Anyway, hope someone can get to it someday, and many thanks to all ff coders. It ROCKS! Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

      <title>Tango Style theme for better Linux UI integration</title>
      <description>Created attachment 265313 [details] Preview of rough draft of Tango-style firefox toolbar icons I would like to propose a move to the Tango [1] icon style for the Linux version of Firefox 3. The Tango project exists to help create a consistent graphical user interface experience for free and Open Source software." Many people think of the Tango project (http://tango.freedesktop.org/) as an icon set. However, Tango is much broader than this. Rather than a single icons set, Tango is a set of visual guidelines to help anyone create a set of icons that can work well together. Projects that have recently adopted the Tango style include the Gimp (upcoming version 2.4), Pidgin (aka Gaim), and Scribus. Work is under way for Inkscape, OpenOffice.org, Blender, and plenty of other projects. Perhaps most significantly, the Gnome desktop, including the significant Gtk-stock icon set has recently moved to the Tango style. Here's a sample: http://www.andreasn.se/blog/?p=45 You can try out Tango in Firefox using the Tango theme: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1565 Keep in mind, though, that we are not limited to that exact icon set. We could develop a new set of icons that match the metaphors of the Winstripe/Pinstripe themes, but redrawn to better tie in with the Tango style (and hence the rest of the Linux desktop). While most of the integration work I have seen for Firefox on the Linux desktop has focused on Gnome, it is worth noting that the visual style of Tango was also designed to fit in relatively well in the KDE environment. Andreas Nilssen, one of the primary icon designers/illustrators with the Tango project has expressed a keen interest in helping out with Tango in Firefox 3. He's willing to redraw icons, and offer them in whatever license is necessary for inclusion upstream in Firefox. Also note that everything I have said here also applies to Thunderbird. I'm looking for some direction on who in particular I should speak to about this - who is driving the visual style of the UI for Firefox 3, and who is driving the Linux aspect in particular.</description>

      <title>Prefill "Address of web site" in cookie exceptions</title>
      <description>Passing on this feature request from someone who contacted me. STR: 1. Turn off cookies 2. Go to a site which requires cookies 3. Open Preferences/Options -&gt; Privacy -&gt; Exceptions... Expect the site to be pre-filled in the "Address of web site:" input. The only concern I'd have is what the expected behavior would be if you switched tabs/windows. Do we change the entry in the input? Or do we keep it how it is? I'd say we keep it static, but it did cross my mind. (Can't find a dupe, so filing as NEW.)</description>

      <title>browser.js should be split up in smaller entities</title>
      <description>According to Sayrer, we should be able to split up browser.js now that we have C.u.import, which should prevent performance regressions due to loading multiple js files. Exactly what would need to be moved where is TBD, as far as I know. Things that could be separated out would include (from a quick glance) browser startup/shutdown handling, browser context handling (clicks, back/forward, etc.), browser search, bookmark handling, tab creation/moving/loading, plugins, feeds, etc. etc. Advantages are mainly in code maintainability (finding stuff in a file that large is painful) and extendability (including a 240k file in any extension window that might need a function or two currently in browser.js is a bit annoying to say the least).</description>

Maybe it would be also nice to have the ability to mark tabs as important with red color. Then it would be nice to have a context menu entry to close all other tabs, but not these marked as new or important. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

      <title>Filetypes supported by Firefox as result of default install do not include .XSL files</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.3) Gecko/20070309 Firefox/2.0.0.3 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.3) Gecko/20070309 Firefox/2.0.0.3 Error occurs when attempting to view the contents of (not render) an XSL file (any XSL file) located on a local hard drive. This happens either when I drag the XSL file from a Windows Explorer window to a new blank browser window, or when I simply double-click the XSL file from within Windows Explorer. I find that the XSL file proceeds to open in Mozilla (the last version of which is still installed on my computer "just in case"), not in Firefox. Apparently, the default Firefox installation script does not update any pre-existing registry entries for &lt;HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.xsl&gt; if Mozilla is still installed on the system. Nor does setting Firefox to be the default browser (after installation) update this registry setting. This could be a feature related to not disturbing previous setups for other browsers, but I would prefer that all my HTML-style files (.htm, .html, .xht, .xhtml, .xml, .xsl, etc.) open in whatever browser I currently have set as the default. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. From Windows Explorer, double-click on any file of type .xsl after installing Firefox on a system that already has a recent version of Mozilla installed. Actual Results: File opens in a Mozilla window. Expected Results: File should have opened in a Firefox window. Bug may only occur when Mozilla has been previously installed on a system and is being replaced by Firefox. The bug does ~not~ cause a crash. It occurs even when Firefox is set to be the default browser on a multi-browser system. I was able to fix the problem manually by editing the &lt;HKCR\xslfile\shell\Open\command\\(default)&gt; registry entry to point to the Firefox executable instead of the Mozilla executable. However, this is probably not something you want noobs to be doing to their systems (not that too many noobs would be trying to view XSL files), so it would be nice if this could be automated as part of either the install process or the system changes that are made behind the scenes when Firefox is selected to be the default browser.</description>

      <title>RFE: Allow users to override the “Secure” attribute of cookies from “not set” to “set” (via the GUI)</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; de; rv:1.8.1.3) Gecko/20070403 Firefox/2.0.0.3 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; de; rv:1.8.1.3) Gecko/20070403 Firefox/2.0.0.3 HTTP cookies have a “Secure” attribute, which is specified in RFC 2965, section 3.2.2, at the top of page 7. The intent of setting this attribute is that the user agent does not send the cookie back over a connection which is less secure than the one which was used when the cookie was initially set. Unfortunately, many web sites do not set this attribute at all even in cases when it would be useful. For example, the Bugzilla login cookie(s) for Bugzilla at &lt;URL:https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/&gt; do not have the attribute set. Another example is the login cookie set by SourceForge.net servers &lt;URL:https://sourceforge.net/&gt; on login. When you first (securely) log in to a website via HTTPS, but later (for example, by accidentally following a link) use HTTP to retrieve something on the same website, this causes your login information to be transmitted in plain over the wire. The problem is even more severe for mixed-mode (secure+insecure) web pages. Log in to mozdev.org’s Bugzilla using the exact address &lt;URL:https://www.mozdev.org/bugs/index.cgi?GoAheadAndLogIn=1&gt; (and run a traffic monitor) to see the problem. Ordinary users can hardly do anything to prevent this from happening (okay, there is bug 321022, of course, which might get fixed someday …). So I propose to allow users to manually override the “Secure” attribute, at best using the GUI. This setting could take into account the host/domain, path, and/or cookie name (must evaluate what is actually useful). Users should only be able to /set/ “Secure” if it is not set, not the other way round. By using this feature, users could make sure they don’t expose private information through their cookies if they normally use HTTPS for doing whatever they do which needs a cookie on the respective website, even if the website is not secured properly. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: Example which uses a Bugzilla account on mozdev.org: 1. Go to &lt;URL:https://www.mozdev.org/bugs/index.cgi?GoAheadAndLogIn=1&gt;. 2. Start a traffic monitor. 3. Log in to mozdev.org’s Bugzilla and see your login cookie be transmitted in plain. Actual Results: Exposure of login information due to misconfigured webserver/scripts. Expected Results: User could have set “Secure” for mozdev.org or for “all sites which I access via HTTPS” first. Browser would not have sent the cookie via HTTP, but only via HTTPS. There is bug 165334, which takes another approach, but can also help in the situation described above.</description>

      <title>A suggestion: „Save session“</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.3) Gecko/20070309 Firefox/2.0.0.3 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.3) Gecko/20070309 Firefox/2.0.0.3 Hello, When I'm browsing the internet, I usually have about 15-20 tabs open, and sometimes more. Those are sometimes links I'd like to/should read, or what I need at that moment. However, there is a problem: if I want to shut down/restart/etc the computer, or just close firefox for now BUT be able to open those tabs later, I have to either bookmark them all to some folder or kill firefox manually (ctrl+alt+del/kill -9/etc), so that I can *restore* the session later. How about having an option to „Save current session“, so that people like me could avoid doing such workarounds? Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open a lot of tabs with interesting information 2. Decide to go away from the PC 3. Understand that you now have to kill Firefox/bookmark everything for further browsing 4. Comment on the bug Expected Results: Have a „Save session“ button :)</description>

Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. log in to a forum where you already have a login and password 2. go to the change password page on that forum 3. look at the popup and tell me if you can _SEE_ who is displaying that popup, is it the website, or is it firefox?</description>

      <title>Ctrl + Shift + arrow should select one part of the url</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727) Build Identifier: This is a feature I would like to see in Firefox. This works in windows but not in linux. The url may be something like http://www.servername.com/subfolder/ingredients/ If I am in that location and I wish to change to http://www.servername.com/subfolder/ I have to put the mouse to the end of the url and paint the part /ingredients/ with the mouse and press delete. This manouver requires high accuracy. It would be easier if I could just put the mouse cursor to the end of the url, click crtl + shift + arrow left, and then press delete. Normally in other applications this combination (ctrl + shift + arrow left) selects (or paints) one word to the left. In this case Firefox does not recongize parts of the url separated by slashes (i.e. /). Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Put the mouse cursor to the end of the url. 2. Click ctrl + shift + arrow left 3. The whole url is selected, not just the first part or folder of the url. Actual Results: Please see above. Expected Results: Only one part (or folder) of the url should be selected.</description>

      <title>New option to Warn user about unencrypted connection only when lock is shown</title>

No warning about submitting data over unencrypted connection 2. with warning. Problem is that on some popular sites, for example search engines like google, each submission results in the popup warning. The only alternative right now is to turn warnings off. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. In Tools-&gt;Options-&gt;Security-&gt;Warning Messages-&gt;Settings-&gt;Show a warning dialog when: check: I submit Information that's not encrypted Apply the change 2.access google.com; enter any search word; press "Enter" 3. Observe popup with a warning anout sending information over unencrypted connection Expected Results: ENHANCEMENT Introduce parameter which will allow to have warnings only if connection from the website to user is encrypted (https), but connection from the user to the website is not encrypted. This way warning popup will appear only when user expects connection to be secure because lock is shown and address bar turns yellow, but the security is only one way from website to user - connection from user to website is not encrypted. Current setting results in warning popup unless connection from user to website is secure. In every day browsing moajority of accesses are over unencrypted connection (web seearches for example). Acknowledging the popup on connections where user does not expect it to be secure becomes tedious and many will turn the warining off. Having ability to have warning only when user excpects security will results in many more users actually using the warning which is conditional.</description>

Get Growl -&gt; Goes to Growl site, user installs, never sees it again. Remind Me Later -&gt; closes prompt, happens again next restart No Thanks -&gt; sets pref, never shows again.

      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322) Build Identifier: Help the user to identify it's service provider Hi, I work for a bank to develop web applications. I think that an urgent change is due to navigators to better fight fishings. After thinking of it, I understood that the problem of phishing is not a client authentification problem, it's a provider's authentification to the client problem. The biggest difficulty that I have to show to beginners (to witch I always install Firefox by the way) is how to read the URL to identify it's domain. Then, after looking at a new software from Verisign, I realised that it would be easy for you to show the visited DOMAIN in a widget apart, in the tool bar of Firefox. When the domain is not available, then the IP adress is shown, and the background of this widget becomes red, with an error message in a bubble. I think that this solution is easy to implement, and would be a fast way to improve the capabilities of ordinary people to authentify their providers. Since it's a security issue, I felt I also had to send a similar request to Microsoft for it's Internet Explorer. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

Also, extensions behave very differently with toolbar-icons or icons in the status bar. Some kind of User Interface Guidelines could help to unify the way how add-ons modify the Firefox UI experience. So my suggestion is that there are UI Guidelines that can be used as a reference by Add-Ons developers. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Install Google Gears 2. Go to "Tools"-menu 3. See the unnecessary "Google Gears Settings"-menu-item Actual Results: I see an unnecessary menu item, that shouldn't be there Expected Results: the settings-menu should reside in the Add-Ons Manager</description>

      <description>The feed links in the Page Info dialog's RSS section should be clickable, so that upon clicking any of them, the corresponding feed is loaded in the browser. This can be useful e.g. when a user tries to preview a feed before subscribing to it, for example. I'll be posting a patch to support this shortly.</description>

      <title>allow for resizable TEXTAREAs</title>
      <description>allow for resizable TEXTAREAs Justin Watt's add-on (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3694) is pretty useful, especially for sites like bugzilla. Apple appears to agree, from http://www.apple.com/safari/ "Resizable text fields. Maybe the text field you’re typing in is a bit too small to read. Or maybe you just have a lot to say. Either way, Safari lets you resize text fields on any website, just by grabbing the corner of the field. Resize a field and the web page reflows to make room. http://images.apple.com/safari/images/textbox20070611.gif" Should we consider this feature for Firefox 3?</description>

      <description>show "no drop" icon when attempting to drag-and-drop a folder onto its self, child or grandchild. right now, we'll just silently "do nothing" on drop. note, firefox 2 has the same issue, where we don't see the "no drop" icon, but when you do drop, we'll just silently "do nothing". see also bug #383678.</description>

      <description>When the user presses and holds the space bar, Firefox should enter into a scrolling mode similar to Photoshop and other image editing applications where the mouse cursor changes to a hand, and down-click drag can be used to scroll around the content area.</description>

      <title>Option to reset search bar engine to default when starting Firefox</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-GB; rv:1.8.1.4) Gecko/20061201 Firefox/2.0.0.4 (Ubuntu-feisty) Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-GB; rv:1.8.1.4) Gecko/20061201 Firefox/2.0.0.4 (Ubuntu-feisty) If one changes the search engine in the search toolbar, Firefox remembers this until it is changed back. One might want the option to have it reset to a default search engine whenever one restarts Firefox. This way, when one changes the search engine to something specific (dictionary or IMDB), it is changed back to the default (e.g. Google). This should be an option, as understandably, some would like it to rememebr the last search engine selected. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Change search engine to something specific like Dictionary search 2. Exit Firefox 3. Restart Firefox 4. Changed search engine is still selected 5. Forget that it's changed, and type in a search term and get results that one doesn't want</description>

      <title>Can't rearrange overflow bookmarks in bookmark bar</title>
      <description>I realize this can be done from the bookmark manager, but it would be nice if you could reorder the bookmark bar, including the overflow bookmarks, directly from the browser UI. It's easy to do this via the click and drag approach for any bookmark currently displayed on the bookmark bar, but it is impossible to click and drag anything from the overflow bookmark drop down menu to the visible section of the bookmark bar.</description>

      <description>for url bar autocomplete, search history title for matches. Here's my example: 1) visit https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=383692 2) the title is "hixie's twitter status script causes firefox to leak memory" in my url bar, I want to type "twitter" or "hixie" and have that link be one of the results. A better example: 1) visit google, click gmail link (link is http://mail.google.com/mail, redirects you to another page with title of "Gmail". neither page has gmail in the url) 2) type gmail in the url bar, I'd like http://mail.google.com/mail to be one of the results.</description>

Firefox gives an option to disable these warnings, but that may not be the smartest thing to do. Warnings should be more sophisticated. There should be options so that (1) If I visit a site regularly, I want to disable the warnings for that site. (2) If the unencrypted content is multimedia (images) or frames, then it's probably not as threatening, so I want to disable these warnings to. Reproducible: Always</description>

      <title>The new Page Info dialog should preserve old dialog's tabbox keyboard shortcut</title>
      <description>Created attachment 269367 [details] [diff] [review] Patch to add the tab switching hotkeys The new Page Info dialog's header (which includes a radiogroup containing radio button, each one responsible for activation of one of the tab panels of the dialog) should support the keyboard navigation mechanisms supported by the old Page Info dialog which used a tabbox. These shortcut keys include: * Ctrl+Tab: move to the next tab * Shift+Ctrl+Tab: move to the previous tab * Ctrl+PgUp: move to the previous tab * Ctrl+PgDn: move to the next tab * Meta+Left: move to the previous tab (Mac OS X specific) * Meta+Right: move to the next tab (Mac OS X specific) * Home: move to the first tab (when the tab bar has the focus) * End: move to the last tab (when the tab bar has the focus) This will provide better keyboard accessibility for switching tabs. I have a patch ready which adds this behavior which I'll attach to this bug. The patch works on the trunk.</description>

There is no option to see more information about what is causing the warning, nor is there a Help button to explain to less sophisticated users what the warning means.

      <title>Very hard to set default background color to something slightly-off-white</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.4) Gecko/20070515 Firefox/2.0.0.4 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.4) Gecko/20070515 Firefox/2.0.0.4 Mozilla 2.0.4 on WinXP. The options dialog allows to change background color of a page (tab Content). It uses a grid of 70 given colors spread throughout the whole color spectrum. This is mistake - very few people want pure red as their background color but many and many are used a very slight yellow color, just like real office paper has. Clear white is unpleasant to eyes and the nearest yellowish color available in the dialog is "too yellow" and unpleasant as well. I suggest to change the color selection tool to allow color specification in very detail (e.g. RGB numeric values). Even better, few slight yellow tinges may be predefined instead of, say, pure colors. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

      <title>consider switching to Oliver Steele's suggested memoization approach</title>
      <description>Firefox code does a lot of memoization of nullary methods, especially for frequently-accessed XPCOM components. Here's an example from the content prefs service: 48 // Observer Service 49 __observerSvc: null, 50 get _observerSvc() { 51 if (!this.__observerSvc) 52 this.__observerSvc = Cc["@mozilla.org/observer-service;1"]. 53 getService(Ci.nsIObserverService); 54 return this.__observerSvc; 55 }, But according to Oliver Steele in this blog post &lt;http://osteele.com/archives/2006/04/javascript-memoization&gt;, our typical implementation is naive and has a number of issues: 1. it's verbose; 2. it mixes domain with memoizaton logic; 3. every memoized method requires an additional private property (a memory hit); 4. every memoized method checks if its value has been computed every time it gets called (a performance hit). Steele suggests an alternate approach that replaces nullary methods with constant functions that return the computed value. The advantages to this approach are that it is less verbose, requires no additional private properties, and does no call-time checking if the value has been computed. It does, however, continue to mix domain and memoization logic (Steele suggests alternatives that don't, but those have other drawbacks). We should consider adopting Steele's suggested approach and switching existing memoized methods to it in our codebase. One question about XPCOM components that I hope someone more familiar with XPCOM can answer: is there a danger of references to XPCOM components disappearing over time (i.e. in the example above from the content prefs service would the observer service reference ever go away and need to be recomputed)? Another issue: how can we replace a getter with a constant function, or would we need to switch the getters to regular methods in order to implement Steele's approach?</description>

      <title>Unify back and forward tab history and provide only one drop-down button (IE7 style)</title>
      <description>1. Keeping back and forward tab history separate makes you search in two places when one would be enough. 2. Only offering one drop-down button (at least when both buttons are located side-by-side), would reduce visual complexity (cf. http://blog.mozilla.com/faaborg/2007/06/26/quantitative-design/ ). 3. A single list could either be offered in the History menu itself (see bug 329183) or as a single sub-menu along the list of recently closed tabs (allowing a cleaner fix for bug 2877439). Although the prototype extension linked from the URL unifies both buttons into one, that wouldn't be necessary. Both buttons could merge if they are side-by-side but stand on their own, preferably keeping the unified tab history as drop-down, though (so that you could remove the Forward button to save space and still have access to the odd page located on the wrong side of history). The unified list would ideally be sorted in reverse order, so that the most recently visited pages are closest to the cursor when the drop-down opens (as IE7 works).</description>

So if phising site pretended to be your bank you would get a warning. This shouldnt be so annoing since you would only get the warning the first time you register for a site. Another option would be that user can add I trust this domain when remember password dialog is shown. Then when you are on those domains the address bar would get yet another colour or yellow. Third I can think of is that there would be some html directive for username/passwords that also tells which site it is. This something your bank would have to put on their page where you login. If this is provided firefox would remember the site info and domain. Each time you login on the site. Firefox would then put an extra bar (like when it stopped popup window) telling which site you are loggin into. If the site doesnt match with the domain you should get a warning. /T Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

There is no clear way for a user to register a feed with this widget from Firefox. This should be offered to users as an option when running on Vista. (It seems like this bug should exist, but I could not find it, I apologize if this is already a dupe) Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Install GP on Vista 2. Turn on the Vista Sidebar, add the Feeds component to it 3. Attempt to register a feed from Firefox to the Feed reader widget. Actual Results: You can't. Expected Results: You should be able to. IE 7's feed button (on its toolbar) will register an RSS feed with this widget automatically when the user subscribes to the feed. This is an enhancement, but to users of Vista, I think this is a very conspicuous lack of functionality where Firefox falls behind IE. It's made worse because that Feed widget is prominently displayed in the sidebar.</description>

No indication on the taskbar in which of the windows the new tab opened. Expected Results: New window opens in a tab in the active Firefox window. If not possible, at least the elected Firefox window flashes on the taskbar to indicate where the new tab ended.</description>

Helper applications in Leopard — including the network time daemon and the Spotlight indexer — are sandboxed to guard against attackers."

      <title>add a "Get me out of here!" button to the malware error page</title>
      <description>The malware error page needs a "Get me out of here!" button. Bug 380932 implemented a malware error page. Bug 384941 will make use of that page. Until that is fixed, the page can be viewed by copying this to the location bar: chrome://global/content/netError.xhtml?c=blacklist&amp;e=malwareBlocked&amp;u=http://evil.foo/&amp;d=The%20site%20at%20evil.foo%20has%20been%20reported%20as%20an%20attack%20site. It's a big scary red warning which ends with "You should not visit this site". I'd expect my mom to panic, calling me and asking what to do now. To give our users a helping hand, we should add a "Get me out of here!" button like in the anti-phishing warning (http://www.google.com/tools/firefox/safebrowsing/phish-o-rama.html - note that the warning is still broken in trunk builds). The button should load the home page (only the first one if multiple home pages are set). This is different from e.g. network error pages because it is so scary, but even some of those have a button like "Try Again".</description>

      <title>Text documents should have start of text in tab name, or window titlebar if no tabs present</title>
      <description>I spend a lot of time using Firefox to read text-only documents such as RFCs. http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc0791.txt When reading a text document, which doesn't have a &lt;title&gt; field, the tab title gives the url. If the document is open in a window without tabs, the window title just says 'Mozilla firefox'. In both cases (and whenever an html document lacks a title), it would be more useful if the text from the start of the document was used in the tab/window title. If text in the document is highlighted, it's important -- and the user has just read the text she highlighted. So update the tab title/window title with the start of that highlighted text.</description>

      <description>I often need to copy my bookmark url, to paste in a page, in bugzilla, in a chat... i need to open bookmark properties and copy url, then close.

However, this only works when the user has already visited the site. By including this same highlighting in the Status Bar when a user hovers over a link, it will enhance security. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Hover over link. 2. Observe link URL displayed in status bar. Actual Results: All characters in URL are equally highlighted. Expected Results: Effective domain is highlighted when viewed in status bar.</description>

      <title>please add automated way to block ads</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X; en-US; rv:1.8.1.3) Gecko/20070309 Firefox/2.0.0.3 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X; en-US; rv:1.8.1.3) Gecko/20070309 Firefox/2.0.0.3 I would like firefox to add a window to enter URLs from which firefox will not load objects. SWF/shockwave embedded flash objects are high on my list. I am currently using Page Info to identify the URLs of embedded objects and add them to my HOSTS file pointing to localhost to collapse them out, but I would like an automated way to do this. This goan can be accomplished several ways, depending on how much work you want to go to. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: when a page loads an embedded shockwave object, you cannot control-click on the object to load it in a new window. (I would call this a bug!) Simply adding "open object in new tab/window" to that contextual menu would really help us. Or "copy object URL" would work too. Better still would be adding an option to add the object's URL (the domain name only) to the earlier described list of domains to not load objects to. ("adfarm.doubleclick.net" etc) Please present a warning if the domain of the embedded object is the same as the page being viewed - a very small number of ads are hosted on the same server as the page. Actual Results: this would take the average user about 10 minutes to remove all the highly annoying animated ads from all their favorite pages. It should be very easy for even new users to figure out how to use. Expected Results: I have just submitted a bug report on Page Info because it seems to not list all embedded objects. I was previously using this as a very inconvenient way of finding the url (domain) of embedded ads to host them out, but now that's not working reliably anymore so we really need this feature now. If this is a dup it would not entirely surprise me but I did look, it's a big list. ;) If it is a dup, please check to see if my additional/alternate ideas to solve this problem are included in the original, else please copy and paste them over so whoever works on this issue has a variety of options to meet the goal.</description>

      <title>CookieSafe and NoScript should be part of the core Firefox product</title>

The default when Firefox is installed could be "cookies for everyone / script for everyone" to make advertisers and newbies happy. Then a couple of checkboxes marked something like "Restrict cookies to sites you trust" and "Restrict JavaScript to sites you trust" could switch to secure mode and turn on the UI controls equivalent to NoScript and CookieSafe. Reproducible: Didn't try I wrote up some &lt;a href="http://meta.ath0.com/2007/02/02/firefox-hint/"&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; on NoScript and CookieSafe on my web site for anyone who doesn't know how they work.</description>

      <title>Wish: Improve tab browser into a vertical bar with tree structure</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686 (x86_64); en-US; rv:1.8.1.4) Gecko/20061023 SUSE/2.0.0.4-1.1 Firefox/2.0.0.4 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686 (x86_64); en-US; rv:1.8.1.4) Gecko/20061023 SUSE/2.0.0.4-1.1 Firefox/2.0.0.4 May I humble put forth this suggestion: That a &gt;&gt; menu at the end of the tabbar, or making tabs overflow to the next line, is not the right solution because 1) in the browser, vertical space is at a premium 2) the &gt;&gt; can be very annoying to those with low-resolution monitors and who use more than 5-ish tabs at a time, in which case tabs become secretly obscured (confusing for new users). The proper solution I feel is demonstrated in the debian package mozilla-tabextensions, where you have a vertical sidebar where you have a *tree* of tabs. Not only does this let you see the *full text of all your tabs* without chopping it off (50 tabs visible with perfect clarity), but also lets you see your "train of through" (or "train of browsing") in tree form. Sketch (overall): - The tabbar is a resizeable vertical pane, NOT in the sidebar. - Each line in the pane houses a tab (favicon + title) -- no background necessary - If overflow happens, then overlay a very large and visible marker on the bottom or top with a non-solid color (unlike &gt;&gt;, which can be hidden depending on color scheme). Sketch (tree structure): - When a new tab is opened not-from-a-webpage (e.g. from the search bar, or url bar, etc.), it gets added to level0 (the leftmost level) at the bottom. - When a new tab is opened from-a-webpage, it gets added as a child of the opening webpage, with indentation approximately equal to the size of the favicon. - If a tab is deleted by closing, close it and all of its descendents. - If you right-click on the tab, you are given the option of killing only that tab -- i.e. killing it and grafting all the child sub-trees onto the parent of the killed tab - There is an additional shortcut, something like ctrl-shift-pgup/pgdw, which tabs you to the next/previous sibling of your current tab, if one exists. If none exist, nothing happens. Reproducible: Always</description>

      <title>Make location bar revisions less irksome</title>
      <description>The intention behind the greying of the non-hostname parts of a display webpage's URL, done by the fix to bug #366797, had laudable intentions, but its implementation left something to be desired. As it greyed out the non-hostname parts of the URL, they became less easy to read. It also 'faded' the text to and from greyed when the mouse hovered over the location bar, which became distracting. The fix to this bug will instead emphasize the hostname, leaving the non-hostname part of the URL black and thus clear to read. It will also only return the entire URL to black when the URL is selected (clicked on or tabbed to), rather than moused-over.</description>

      <description>Over in bug 389347, comment 1, Brendan has noted that giving names to function expressions assigned to object properties has a performance impact, and that the practice should be unnecessary, as it should be possible to identify the "name" of a function assigned to a property (i.e. the name of the property itself) using bytecode inspection under the JS debugger API. Once bug 389347 is fixed, we should investigate removing the names of function expressions from the Firefox code.</description>

      <title>location bar could treat "/", "." and "&amp;" as word separators, to improve functioning of Ctrl-arrows and Ctrl+Delete</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1.5) Gecko/20061201 Firefox/2.0.0.5 (Ubuntu-feisty) Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1.5) Gecko/20061201 Firefox/2.0.0.5 (Ubuntu-feisty) In Windows version of Firefox, I can use Ctrl-Backspace in order to remove parts of the URL. In Linux version, chars like "/" are not treated as word separators, so Ctrl+Backspace removes everything up to the beginning of the line, and Ctrl+arrows work just like Home/End. It would be nice if the Linux behaviour followed the Windows behaviour, as it is rather handy in correcting mistyped URLs or changing URL parameters. This may be considered low priority as it's mainly a feature for advanced users, but it affects browsing comfort nevertheless. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Type a complex (but valid - no spaces etc) URL in the location bar (say, https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Firefox&amp;format=guided) 2. Press Ctrl-left a few times, then Ctrl-right a few times, and observe the behaviour 3. Do the same in the Windows version, and compare the behaviour to Linux version 4. Do the same with Ctrl-backspace shortcut Actual Results: Ctrl-left instead of moving the caret one URL part to the left (subdomain, parameter etc), double-acts as Home Ctrl-right double-acts as End Expected Results: Starting from the end and pressing Ctrl-left several time, the sequence of caret stops should be "guided", "format", "Firefox", "product", "cgi", "enter_bug", "org", "mozilla", "bugzilla", "https".</description>

      <title>Option for clicking a bookmarks toolbar folder to open the first bookmark in it</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; FreeBSD i386; en-US; rv:1.8.0.3) Gecko/20060504 Firefox/1.5.0.3 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; FreeBSD i386; en-US; rv:1.8.0.3) Gecko/20060504 Firefox/1.5.0.3 It would be nice if folders on the Personal Toolbar Folder could be made to act as a normal bookmark if clicked. Here's my example: I have a "Google" folder with bookmarks for Search, Mail, Images, Translate, Groups, Maps, etc. in it. 9 times out of 10 I want to use "Search". I would like the ability to just click on the folder without opening the drop-down menu, and take me to the normal Google home page. If I instead drag the mouse downward, or input any other motion, then the folder contents could drop down and I could choose from them. If you prefer, you can think of it this way. I used to have a dedicated "Google Search" button on my Personal Toolbar Folder. When Google started adding more services, I wanted to group them together, with "search" still my default Google action, but sometimes wanting to use other services. The closest I could get is to create the Google folder, but then I lost the ability to just click on the toolbar element itself to go directly to search. Hopefully that makes sense, though I have no idea if it's feasible to implement. Reproducible: Always</description>

FIREFOX - which as I ,said does not support or is not supported by FIREFOX. Therefore, I am stuck! I did search all the options of both IE7 and FIREFOX without success as well as the registry which I checked for hours trying to see where IE7 was calling FIREFOX ! without success. Besides this problem that prevents me from upgrading our website, please accept the recognition of my strongest satisfaction with firefox. I contaminate many IE7 users ... Kinds Regards Bernard HOUEL Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.type http://www.safeqry.com/bo/login.asp in IE7 2.verify that you access www.safeqry.com/index.asp in ... FIREFOX 3.Unfortunately, my machine (DELL 9300, 100MB disk, XP-US, 2GB memory) does NOT react like my colleagues' where they can call IE7 without a problem when they need it. But it happens everytime on "my" machine ... Actual Results: http://www.safeqry.com/index.asp IN FIREFOX !! Expected Results: the login prompt of our website modification system (if you need it, I'll send send a login for you, but please, do not change our site! of course ...) HELP !!!</description>

Some programs such as the GIMP (I'm unsure about Photoshop) place a nifty pan tool in the otherwise-blank space at the corner where the two scrollbars meet. That isn't very user-discoverable, but we could put some UI elsewhere also. Now perhaps we'll decide not to provide this, but I think we should just consider it as this could be popular - and critical - with some users at some times. Zoom is GOING TO lose users, this would be SUCH a handy help. Screenshots of the GIMP feature coming up. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

      <title>expose an API for getting an nsIHandlerInfo object for a protocol</title>
      <description>The external helper app service has a method, GetProtocolHandlerInfo, for retrieving an nsIHandlerInfo object for a protocol, but it's not exposed to frontend code via any API. Exposure would be useful, since code in the Download Actions dialog (which I'm modifying over in bug 377784) would benefit from being able to retrieve nsIHandlerInfo objects for protocols via an API rather than directly from the datasource. dmose: GetProtocolHandlerInfo says "XXX before we expose this to the UI, we need sort out our strategy re the "warning" and "exposed" prefs" &lt;myk&gt; dmose: do you know what the issues are there? &lt;dmose&gt; myk: i just wanted to make sure we didn't break existing semantics &lt;dmose&gt; myk: i talked to beltzner, and he said he wanted to break the warning semantics &lt;dmose&gt; and that we'd go ahead and do that now and discuss more during security review &lt;dmose&gt; as far as i know, we haven't broken the "exposed" semantics or the forbidden semantics &lt;dmose&gt; some automated tests in that area would be a fine thing &lt;myk&gt; dmose: so you're comfortable with me exposing that method to the UI? &lt;dmose&gt; i think so, yes. maybe paste the stuff i said above into the bug, and add qa-wanted</description>

While Ctrl+Click is definitely an option, I think it will be much easier for users to be able to set as default a preference to always open new tabs. Saves much effort and reduces the possibility of over-writing the active tab by accident. The preference could be placed under Tab options in Tools-&gt;Options or in about:config.

      <description>This idea was raised by Alex as a comment to my blog entry about reading from the system address book within Thunderbird and SeaMonkey. After we can access the address book now shall we also add a submenu to the bookmarks menu of Firefox? Safari has it implemented and it's kinda nice to have direct access to the given website of your contacts. Peter and David, as I see the checked-in patches aren't shared code, right? Do you both see a possible way if or how we could share the code between Firefox/Mailnews? Thanks.</description>

      <title>maintain MRU list of possible applications</title>
      <description>To make it easier for users to select an application to handle a given MIME type or protocol, we should keep an MRU list of recently used applications in the content handling datastore. It's unclear whether we should keep type-specific (where type is either a MIME type or a protocol scheme), classification-specific (where a classification represents a group of types, like "event" or "image"), or an overall MRU list, so we'll need to figure that out. The patch in bug 385740 means that possible handler applications are now represented by records in the datasource, so it should be possible to build upon that functionality to create lists of such applications. We could do this in a variety of ways. One possibility is to store the date a handler app was last used in the handler app record and then build the MRU list by retrieving an unordered list of handler apps and then sorting by date on the frontend. Another option is to maintain a sorted list of handler apps in the datasource. Per bug 385740, we are keeping a type-specific list of possible applications, but it isn't possible to sort that list in the RDF datasource, since the list is built via multiple assertions, and RDF datasources do not guarantee their order. But maintaining sorted lists in the datasource is a suboptimal approach, since it ties us more to the current RDF implementation of the datastore. If we were to switch to SQLite, we would almost certainly store records in unordered fashion in the database (since that's how databases store records) and sort them on the frontend (or in the query).</description>

Because of their job they still have to use computers to get the job done. I have some customers that have asked if I could create their web application in such way that when they are editing text in a textarea, input field or in e.g. an online WYSIWYG editor like FCKeditor then they would like to see a larger (thicker) caret (insertion point indicator) as well as customizable color on it. I'm talking about the blinking insertion point indicator that looks approximately like this character: | If it is firefox that renders the caret and not the OS, then I would like to see a possibility for the enduser to make Firefox use a custom caret. I would like to see support for: Custom width such as 1px, 2px, 3px, 4px, 5px and Custom color. Hope this can be supported in near future. If you the core developers choose not to implement this, then please get some extension developers to develop something that make this possible. I know that this is probably not a big issues for most endusers out there, but for the people that have an issue with this, it will definitely improve their browser experience. Keep up the good work. Firefox shines :-) Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

Since I'm using the en-GB locale, it would be better to forward the request to google.co.uk/ebay.co.uk, which return different results. In particular, ebay shows me products from UK with prices in £;the same thing happens if I do a google search and click products. Google also returns more appropriate search results when the regional site is used. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

      <title>Quickly save bookmarks to a common place</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-GB; rv:1.8.1.6) Gecko/20070725 Firefox/2.0.0.6 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-GB; rv:1.8.1.6) Gecko/20070725 Firefox/2.0.0.6 Hi, Here's a suggestion for a little extra feature that will make Firefox stand out. I will usually use the bookmarks menu to save something I will refer to in future. However I often find that I'm cluttering up the menu with a ton of bookmarks that might not even visit in the next 6 months but still want to find again if required. To remedy this the suggestion would be to have a new option in the file menu to simply save the url as a url file on the hard drive. There could also be an extra option in File Save as to save a complete web page and the url file in question in one sweep. For someone who is doing some little research on the web and is building up some reference material locally it would be invaluable and a lot more efficient than having to dig through bookmarks in Firefox or having to drag and drop through a maze of directories. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: N/A Actual Results: N/A Expected Results: N/A Just a feature suggestion.</description>

      <title>[mac] Consider using smaller font in bookmark bar folder menus</title>
      <description>Right now, the used in the bookmark bar folder menus is the same as regular context (and other) menus. I propose we use the same size we use in the location bar, which is a point or two smaller. This is what Safari 3 does and I think it looks nicer and less overbearing. Currently, I think the "Latest Headlines" menu visually outweighs the location bar and looks weird.</description>

      <description>show keywords as url bar autocomplete choices say I have some keywords (g for google) or (b for bugzilla). if I type "g firefox", on the trunk and even after the fix for bug #389491 we will not show any results. what about, if you type "g xxxx", we show "g xxxx" to indicate that it will do a keyword search, and show the keyword description as the title, and use the favicon (if we have it) if "g xxxx" happens to be a page title or in a url, we'd still show that. keywords should probably come first in our results.

Currently, almost all checkboxes in "Clear Private Data" dialogue are checked, and if we want to check one checkbox only, we have to manually uncheck almost all of available ones -- for example, to clear cache only -- without clearing history, cookies, etc. It's really often operation, for me -- _much_ more often than clearing all in one time -- and not for security at all, I just want to clear cache, but not cookies or history. So, it makes sense to add ability to check or uncheck all checkboxes in just one click -- it's possible by providing checkbox "Check all" in beginning of the checkboxes list in the "Clear Private Data" window. It will improve user experience in Firefox while is easy to introduce. Just in case -- it's not the same as 'Clear all' feature (that was proposed earlier by other people) at all, it's usability feature that prevents routine clicks both in case of checking all options and in case of checking just one option. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open "Clear Private Data" dialogue. 2. Try to check one option only -- Cache for example. Actual Results: You have to manually uncheck almost all checkboxes checked by default. Expected Results: Ability to check or uncheck all options in just one click should be provided. Full demonstration of proposed functionality implemented in HTML/JavaScript is available through the bug URL.</description>

Now when I use the 'right click on tab / Close Other Tabs' function, this closes all except the tab I clicked on.

At the top would be a simple list of the various areas of memory that tend to eat up RAM. The ones that I can think of right now include plugin memory usage, page cache memory usage, image cache memory usage, and memory that has been freed but is still being reported by the OS as used. Any other categories that tend to use large amounts of memory should be listed here as well. Below this, there would be a total amount of memory actually being used by Firefox. Optionally, a tree structure could be shown below this (like treesize) that would allow its sections to be expanded/contracted for more detail. This could be implemented in the future if it is deemed to difficult to initially address. Someone mentioned that the about:cache page shows some of this information. Unfortunately, some of the information is a little bit mislabeled, so users commonly misinterpret it. There's also a bug in the display, so it displays an impossibly incorrect number after clearing the cache. Not surprisingly, the number of complaints about the bogus and misleading information (and about all memory complaints in general) has gone down drastically as memory leaks have been fixed. This suggests to me that people never look at this stuff if they are not having a problem. If necessary, memory swapped to disk can be reported, but should be clearly labeled and in a separate section from the main RAM memory stats. For consistency, usage data in all sections should be reported in the same format (e.g. '25.1' for 25.1 MB used). Obviously, some of these features are harder to implement than others. However, I think that once even a subset of this was implemented well, it could be used as an agent in addressing the various memory hog rumors that are hard to quash (while helping people understand why Firefox uses memory the way it does).

      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Firefox 2.0; Kubuntu) Gecko Build Identifier: Firefox 2.0.0.6 on Kubuntu 7.04 I do a lot of HTTP debugging using Firefox, and it annoys me when totally unrelated RSS requests mess it up. I tried to find a setting to control the unrequested fetching, but failed. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Have a live bookmark folder or two. 2. Watch network traffic. Actual Results: Firefox arrogantly assumes that i wish to look at the live bookmarks often. Expected Results: Only update the live bookmarks when i say so. The pref could be called "browser.feeds.update" and hold a positive integer: 0 - manually 1 - current behavior (update interval specified in RSS file?) n - every n seconds</description>

      <description>Provide links to all upper dir levels in FTP/File/Jar/Gopher dir listing From Bug 294800 Comment #56 &gt; What the current patch doesn't do is to output &gt; &gt; &lt;h1&gt;Index of &lt;a href="ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/"&gt;ftp.mozilla.org&lt;/a&gt;/ &gt; &lt;a href="ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/"&gt;pub&lt;/a&gt;/mozilla.org/&lt;/h1&gt; &gt; &gt; instead of &gt; &gt; &lt;h1&gt;Index of ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/&lt;/h1&gt; &gt; &gt; I'd like to leave that to a follow-up bug. Hence created this bug... PS: Alternately for ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/ &lt;h1&gt;Index of &lt;a href="/" &gt;ftp.mozilla.org&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="../../.." &gt;pub&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="../.." &gt;mozilla.org&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=".." &gt;firefox&lt;/a&gt;/releases/&lt;/h1&gt; will also works.</description>

      <title>Dock menu for Firefox could include 'Re-Open in Safe Mode'</title>
      <description>I was noticing that on Windows, there is a separate thing that looks like an executable installed that uses Safe Mode. It should be possible to do the same for Mac OS X as well. Really, one should be able to create /Applications/Firefox_SafeMode.app, for example, by creating a minimal app bundle a that would mostly refer to resources in /Applications/Firefox. If it is deemed necessary to have this on Win, why not on the Mac also?</description>

      <title>Enhancement bug (couldn't find that as a category)..</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.6) Gecko/20070725 Firefox/2.0.0.6 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.6) Gecko/20070725 Firefox/2.0.0.6 Sorry if this is mis-categorized, no "Enhancement Bug" category per the directions on the FAQ. Suggestion - disable all potentially harmful active content (Javascript, etc.) on links that have never been visited before until the user approves the site, probably via a popup window or toolbar window. Similar to how popups are approved on a site, just for all the potentially harmful tech at once. A short display of the site's specifics (real domain, country of origin, etc.) may be presented to assist the user in their decision. This is a "brickwall" technique- no matter how good the bad programmers are, it will stop the execution of harmful code until the user decides that the site is trustworthy. The list of user-approved sites would have to be maintained separately from temporary files (cookies, etc.) to avoid having the list cleared when the cache is cleared. Sites may be able to "register" with an organization to automatically approve the use of potentially harmful content, which would shortcut the process. The user's list of sites may also be kept with that organization and checked via the browser. Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3. Actual Results: Enhancement "bug". Expected Results: Enhancement "bug"</description>

When one chooses the "Other" option for other applications, Firefox has a simple file browser rather than give a list of the other applications that can open that file type via the OS or desktop. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Click on a link to download a file which requires a helper application (such as a PDF) 2. When the menu comes up asking whether one wants to open or save it, click on "Open with..." option and choose "Other" Actual Results: Simple file browser is given Expected Results: A list of registered applications which can open the file type (with a spearate option for a file browser). I am using Xfce and Thunar. I'm unsure if this is a feature of these, or if they are using information from the Freedesktop.org specifications (I believe they are).</description>

      <title>Allow resizing the search bar in Customize Toolbars mode</title>
      <description>I think it should be possible to resize the search bar and address bar by just dragging while in Customize Toolbars mode. Reasons: 1) Users coming from Firefox 2 might not have the splitter on the toolbar. (Bug 267831 added the splitter to the default set, used by new profiles, but did not make changes to existing profiles.) 2) Many users want the search bar to be a size other than the default but don't want to resize it often enough to justify having a splitter. For these users, resizing it takes a zillion steps (enter CT mode, put the splitter on the toolbar, exit CT mode, resize, enter CT mode again, remove the splitter, exit CT mode again).</description>

It would be better if it remembered the status it had the last time one deleted personal data. I think in previous versions of Firefox this problem did not exist. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open the Dialog to delete personal Data (Dont know the accurate name in English versions) 2. Check the Checkbox next to "Cookies" and close the dialog 3. Open the dialog again Actual Results: When you open the dialog again that box is not checked anymore Expected Results: The checkbox should be checked, because it has been checked before and it is very likely that i want to delete my cookies again (because i wanted so before). This is also true for someone who does not want to delete cookies (If he did not want so last time he seems to prefer to keep his cookies). I expected Firefox to remeber the status of the checkbox.</description>

As a designer am i getting sick of having to choose between only a small handful of fonts! making images for all fonts is tiresome and inefficient use of bandwidth. if firefox introduced standards based embedded font support ie and safari would likely take advantage of it also. so many advances in web technology but still many of the same old limitations.

      <title>"Wrong" time from dc:date without a colon in timezone offset</title>
      <description>Craigslist RSS feeds use invalid dc:date values, along the lines of &lt;dc:date&gt;2007-08-28T21:38:22-0700&lt;/dc:date&gt; when the timezone offset should instead be -07:00 with a colon. Since the regex in W3CToIETFDate() is already ensuring that there's [+-] in front of four digits coming after everything else we want, it ought to be safe to make the colon optional. STR: 1. Load attachment 278724 [details], a Craigslist search feed as of 2007-08-27. 2. Note that the preview lists the first item with a date of "Tue, Aug 28, 2007 2:38 PM" (if you're in PDT, as I am now), the result of treating 21:38:22 as a UTC time, rather than showing it as "9:38 PM", the intended time.</description>

It justs shots it so the shutting down sequence is shorter (faster). But when I boot up the computer hours or days later firefox asks me if I would like to restore the session. Usually I don't know anymore which pages were open but letting them open again by the session restore feature is often helpful for me because I got my favourite websites which I access quite often. So there is a good chance I will get thouse websites again. But sometimes I run some special php scripts on a server which should only be run once to add some entries in the database. If I would run this script twice, thouse entries would be 2 times in the database. If I don't know which websites will be opened/scripts will be executed when I use the session restore feature I would have to open the session blind or not use the session restore feature. And if I am not able to use the session restore feature because I don't know what it is doing the feature is useless for me and just keeps me for a short time from opening the websites again manually. If firefox would tell me what he would like to open (some info about the websites) when he askes if he should open it would be advantageous. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. open a few tabs with a few websites 2. kill firefox 3. forget what you have opened 4. run firefox again and make your decision if he should restore the session or not Actual Results: firefox asks you if he should open thouse websites again without telling you what he is talking about Expected Results: firefox should ask you if he should open the websites he has listed below</description>

The Places revamp of bookmarks promises to be awesome, but I can't find any bugs on History improvement, so I guess it hasn't properly come up? As glaz says, the "by site" search is misleading, and could be split into a genuine "by site" search and a "by page title" search. A really simple improvement would be displaying the URL of history items in a tooltip, to better distinguish the ones with duplicated or vague page titles -- or even grouping duplicates of a page title under a collapsible tree if under "by page title" search. Putting the "by date" search into collapsible day-folders as "by date and site" already does seems dead-simple to do. I'm just throwing out ideas here, though. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: Use the History UI for a few weeks/months/years. Actual Results: A dreary existence. Expected Results: Smart and engaging UI.</description>

I've been getting bug reports that this menu goes away when there are no browser windows open. At first I was confused by this since I don't have a Mac, but I've since learned that the Mac toolbar remains even when there are no windows open. From my understanding, when all windows are closed, any menu entries by extensions are automatically removed. It would be nice if there was some kind of method to allow menu entries to remain after the windows are closed. For example in Session Manager's case, to load a session a Mac user must first open a blank window in order to access the sub menu in the toolbar menu. Then the user can open a session. It would be nice if the user could just open the session without having to open a blank window first. Reproducible: Always</description>

      <title>Add undo close window feature</title>
      <description>Bug 360408 added back in the APIs which apparently would make this fairly easy to implement. It's something I've wanted on many occasions and now the new Opera 9.5 alpha is being shown off with this as one of it's new additions. I was mainly thinking just another menu "Recently Closed Windows" off the history menu for parity with the recently closed tabs menu. So would this be taken for Firefox 3?</description>

      <title>scripts can automatically submit file uploads selected by the user</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.8.1.4) Gecko/20070629 Firefox/2.0.0.4 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.8.1.4) Gecko/20070629 Firefox/2.0.0.4 The gmail web application automatically uploads attachments selected in the background, so users can continue to compose their mail while the file uploads. Essentially, immediately after the user selects a file by clicking on the "Browse" button of a file &lt;input&gt; field, the script can begin uploading the file. This could be a security problem if the user accidentally selects the wrong file (ex: confidential banking information, etc) and the script has the authority to commit the upload automatically. I propose that form submissions involving file uploads that are triggered automatically (via javascript) offer the user a warning dialog box. Perhaps something like "The site http://www.gmail.com is attempting to automatically upload the file 'mybankinfo.doc'. Should gmail.com be allowed to upload this file?" with Yes and No options. This way, a user who made a mistake and selected the wrong file has an opportunity to correct the situation and select the right file before allowing the upload to proceed. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: Using gmail example: 1. Compose new message. 2. Attach a file. 3. Wait as gmail uploads the file. Actual Results: The file is uploaded (silently). Expected Results: My browser should confirm with me that I intended to upload this file before it allows the script to trigger the upload. On the other hand, if I purposefully submit the form by clicking a submit button on the page, I'm responsible for authorizing the upload and the browser need not confirm it a second time. This could be made into a security setting so that users who were annoyed by the extra step to confirm an automatic upload could turn the feature off.</description>

      <title>Mozilla should have debug builds, symbol server, and easy way to sync source code to a release</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0 Build Identifier: Maybe some of this infrastructure already exists, but I couldn't find any info on it. The scenario is somebody that is developing a javascript application sometimes needs to drop into the debugger to understand why Firefox is doing something a certain way. A typical DHTML engineer that has some C++ debugging skills probably doesn't have the time to build a full debug release of Mozilla (the build has gotten better but it still takes a while to figure out and a long time to build). An engineer might also be debugging problems that are different in different versions of the browser. Ironically, in some ways it can be easier for an application developer to debug Internet Explorer since Microsoft provides a public symbol server (SRV**http://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols). Mozilla can do a lot better by providing a public symbol server, debug build versions of all released builds, and an easy way to sync to the source code of a particular build (may already exist). In my ideal world, there would be a page "Debugging Firefox without building it yourself" that would provide links to all debug builds that can be installed, a symbol server with public symbols that works with ntsd/windbg/VS (and I am guessing this can be made to work with other platforms too but I don't know if the tools are that advanced), and a label or branch or whatever the CVS equivalent is to sync a client to the source code for that release. This would have helped me and my fellow engineers numerous times with debugging problems we've hit in Mozilla. It probably would result in higher quality bugs being submitted and possibly bug fixes.

      <title>Instrument the location bar auto-complete to report accuracy</title>
      <description>As we tweak the algorithm for auto completion in the location bar, we need actual data to understand which techniques work better than others. For each time the user enters text in the location bar, what if we recorded which result they selected, and then aggregated and reported this information back? During the beta testing phase of Firefox 3 we could then change the algorithm in the nightly builds, and get data on if we made things better or worse.</description>

Every time I print I have to select my printer from the long list of other printers. In addition Firefox doesn't remember the printer that was used the last time and 'Printer Name' combobox always defaults to the first printer in list. Proposition: Firefox needs to remember the list of printers most actively used and show them on top of the list of 'Printer Name' combobox. Alternatively this can be in some other, dedicated combobox of recently used or preferred printers. Also last printer needs to be remembered between prints and defaulted to when printing the next time. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. see above 2. 3.</description>

For example: if there is a selection box on the page, and if the user scrolls within the selection box, and reaches the end of the scrolling region, the whole page starts to scroll. This is not what the user normally expects, and is visually annoying. An option to turn off page scrolling when an inner component is being scrolled is what this enhancement request is asking for.

It is also possible to specify what kind of data will be deleted and if the user has to confirm the deletion or not. However, when the confirmation option is turned on, the user also will be asked for confirmation when closing Firefox. In my opinion, this is inconvenient. The confirmation option should be in effect only for the deletion on demand. Furthermore, it should be possible to choose separately, what data will be deleted when closing Firefox and what data will be deleted when the user demands it. In short, both cases should be handled independently. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

      <title>support a "search:" protocol</title>
      <description>support a "search:" protocol the "search" protocol (that your browser would register for) would make it easy search for some text in your "default" engine. (This seems related to have web apps as content handlers, right?) Instead of allowing search engines (like google / yahoo / msn, etc) to register, the browser just uses whatever your default search is (as IE, Firefox, Opera, Safari all have search boxes these days) One use: adding a context menu to the message pane in Thunderbird that would launch my default browser to my default search engine with the selected text. Another use, but an internal to firefox one, was for bug #373352. When a user typed "foo bar" in the url bar, we could present a "Search for 'foo bar'" option, that would send the search to the default search engine. (Maybe applications like thunderbird could be smart and only show that context menu if the search protocol was registered with the OS? not sure.) Of course for things like this, it is only useful if other browsers followed along, and that's always the tough part. see also bug #395998 My only concern is adding protocols to firefox might open up attack vectors, so I'll cc the right people so they can weigh in.</description>

The user has already said he doesn't want to quit in the download dialog box. He/she shouldn't have to say don't quit again.

      <title>need better way for themes to style empty about:blank page</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.8.1.7) Gecko/20070914 Firefox/2.0.0.7 Build Identifier: It would be great if Fx3 allowed add-on themes to use rules which style the background of the about:blank page. Currently, you can't do it in the theme (as far as I can tell). There are ways to get the same effect, but they all force the user to "take steps" rather than "just working". 1/ Users can use an extension like Cusser's "New Tab Homepage", which will display the page defined (via the Options window) as Firefox's home page in new tabs. This would require that - 1) users know about the extension - 2) users can find and install the extension - 3) users can download and save to disk some page (provided by the theme author) containing the watermark image - 4) users can locate the downloaded page - 5) users can configure Firefox to use the downloaded page containing the watermark image (which requires knowing how to formulate a valid file:// URL) as the default Home page. Users could just link to the page containing the watermark image at its location on the web, but that's additional traffic that doesn't need to occur, could induce delays during Fx start-up, and would be a burden for dial-up users. I'm not positive, but it may also suffer from not drawing the watermark when opening a URL in a new tab, leaving a period during which the undecorated blank background would show through. This is a problem for themes designed around a darker color scheme, for which a white flash behind a loading page is pretty low-quality. 2/ Users can edit userContent.css to include code such as the following. @-moz-document url(about:blank) { html { background: url("chrome://global/skin/watermarks/watermark.jpg") no-repeat center center fixed black !important; } } Again, this requires that - 1) users know about the above code - 2) users can find and edit userContent.css - 3) users know the difference between userContent.css and userChrome.css For the average user, IMHO, even just finding and editing userContent.css is a pretty big step outside their comfort zone. Big problem: watermark image is theme-specific, and this code would apply even if the user switches to a different theme, where the watermark might not match any more. Big problem: this code incorrectly also applies to embedded documents (iframes etc.) within content pages displayed by the browser, e.g. the backgrounds of webmail editing forms (aim.com, possibly others). It's possible that some better userChrome fix exists -- like a way to write a more narrowly-focused selector such that it applies to the about:blank page only, and not to the contents of iframes and other elements embedded within the browser content area. So, any way to improve this situation would be great. The first thing that comes to mind is adding some id attribute to the root element of the document displayed by the empty about:blank page, and making sure that that document uses some stylesheet from the default theme (e.g. skin/global.css, or a yet-to-be-defined file such as browser/skin/tabbrowser/aboutBlank.css).

My customers want to be warned if they make changes to a form and then leaves the form without having submitted the changes. If I do this then I found it to work flawlessly except for one ugly thing: onunload = function(oEvent){ if (form_is_modified(document.forms[0])) if (confirm('The form has been modified, do you want to save changes?')) saveForm(); } Then it will fire whenever the user moves to another page, refresh the page or close the window (and more). I hoped to be able to use the above onunload function in my project, but because it is impossible for me to know if the unload event was triggered by a change in the URL or if the user closed the window, I cannot use it. The reason is this. When user closes the window I do not want to ask him if he wants to save changes if the form was changed, because the window will be closed anyway... and the question will only confuse and misinform the user. I want to be able to detect from within my onunload function if the users closed the window in order to skip this test: if (form_is_modified(document.forms[0])) So, could you developers please set a parameter that I can check in my onunload function, so I can do something like this: onunload = function(oEvent){ if (window.windowIsClosing == 0){ if (form_is_modified(document.forms[0])) if (confirm('The form has been modified, do you want to save changes?')) saveForm(); } } So when user click the X in window upper right corner or closes the window by using any other method or whatever... I want you, before anything else to set the new parameter.... something like this: windowIsClosing == 1 I do not want to cancel the closing of the window in any way, only be able to use the unload event more accurately. I find it strange that there is no way for me in javascript to check if the users is about the close the window! As I know it, no browser have support for this. Please please, add this feature as soon as possible and hopefully you could file som suggestions to the w3c for some new standard feature ... then hopefully the rest of the browsers would follow.... Keep up the good work. Firefox rocks... Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

On many sites this is no problem, but there is a fair lot of web programmers out there thinking that characters such as double quotes or colons are fine for a page title. However, if you try to save a file containing such characters, an operating system/browser may freeze. I recommend a switchable feature in Firefox that converts automatically such dangerous characters to single quotes, or underscores resp., before transmitting the title to a file save dialog box, thus nobody accidentally tries to save a file with those characters in its name.

      <title>Add an option to close the browser tab/window when launching on a file which is not handled directly by Firefox</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; it; rv:1.8.1.7) Gecko/20070914 Firefox/2.0.0.7 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; it; rv:1.8.1.7) Gecko/20070914 Firefox/2.0.0.7 It would be nice if it were an option to make Firefox close the opened tab/window when you start it from the shell on a file which is not handled directly, like Internet Explorer does. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. suppose you don't have any particular plugin to handle .wav files in Firefox 2. suppose you have a file called Popeye.wav in che current directory 3. on a command prompt, type: &lt;install-dir&gt;\Firefox2\firefox Popeye.wav Actual Results: A new Firefox blank window is opened. Firefox asks to open or save the requested file. Whichever is your choice, the blank window stays open. Expected Results: If it were an option like "close blank window when opening Firefox on an external file from the shell", I could check it so that, in the described scenario, while opening the "Open/Save as" dialog, the blank useless Firefox window would be closed. Internet Explorer works in this way. The reported example could not be so meaningful, but there can be other more interesting scenarios. For instance, suppose you have a Sun JRE installed and you have properly configured Firefox to open .jnlp files with Java Web Start. Moreover, suppose Firefox is your system default browser. If you start Firefox on a .jnlp file, from the shell, a useless blank window stays open while Java Web Start starts the Java app: it would be nice if that window could be closed automatically. We have a web application with some client applications delivered using Java Web Start, and each one can launch URLs to other .jnlp files to open other client applications (we must pass through the server because of the need to get some configuration/authentication information from it): if Firefox is the system default browser, we have this annoying side effect of the blank windows remaining open.</description>

      <title>Icon size</title>

So - when I change the icon size to, for example, small, both toolbars have small icons. If i choose "Large icons", both toolbars have large icons. See where this is going? - I can't set Navigation toolbar to LARGE and Bookmarks toolbar to SMALL icons. I suggest that the icon resizer is updated so that you can change the toolbars' icons' size seperately for each toolbar. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Set toolbar icons' to SMALL or LARGE Actual Results: All toolbars are set to this size Expected Results: Size is set only for the selected toolbar</description>

      <title>user should be able to specify 'ignore FF version requirement' for specific extensions</title>
      <description>This would just be a valuable tool in the tool box. Say I update from 2.0.0.6 to 2.0.0.7. Some number of extensions I have are incompatible. I should be able to go through the list and say 'Use this extension anyway." It is my copy of FF after all. If the extension author thinks there might be a problem, or perhaps cannot be bothered to update the extension, I could decide I an willing to take that risk. Should there be a warning? Yes, but it should be possible. I am tempted to not say this is an enhancement. Is every 'do the right thing' bug is an enhancement request. Well, it is not something we intended to do and that we did wrong. It is something that should be intended. So, I guess I will mark it as an enhancement.</description>

      <title>"Save All Tabs" feature</title>
      <description>Occasionally I'm doing some research in Firefox, and I want to save the results of my research on disk for future reference. If these pages are opened in multiple tabs, currently the only way to achieve my goal is by switching to each tab and saving the page manually. This doesn't work well for cases where there are a lot of tabs to save. The nearest available feature is "Bookmark All Tabs" from the Bookmarks menu, which doesn't give me what I want, but at least allows me to save all of the links to the pages open in each tab quickly. I think a new "Save All Tabs" in the file menu is worth adding, which would prompt the user for a location to save the pages to, and would handle things like duplicate file names and saving both pages and other documents (such as images) in the saving process well.</description>

I suggest it to be star with colored outline (though you can also think about gray star, or black star, or half painted star). It would be useful in several ways: 1. In drop down from location bar, you could easier spot important pages 2. It is also some sort of phishing indicator - if you visit some page frequently, it should have star changed. If it doesn't, then it is likely that someone is trying to trick you that you are on expected page. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

      <title>Improve the appearance of messages shown in the content area? (netError, feed preview, etc)</title>
      <description>Do we want to refresh the appearance of messages shown in the content area (no internet connection, RSS preview, SLL errors, browsing an FTP server) in Firefox 3? Also, do we want to theme these messages for each platform, beyond the yellow exclamation point triangle icon being used? Personally I'm in favor of transitioning all of these messages to door-hanger notifications off of the favicon button, to be more consistent with where Firefox addresses the user. But since we probably aren't going to do that, do we want to consider a visual refresh of content area messages?</description>

      <title>Include a bookmark to getmiro.com for new profiles in Firefox 3?</title>
      <description>While redesigning content handling for Firefox 3, at one point we were planning on inspecting RSS feeds to see the types of enclosures, and re-filtering the list of possible applications for feeds that contained podcasts and video podcasts: http://people.mozilla.com/~faaborg/files/20070521-contentHandling/unifiedContentHandling2.png As part of detecting podcasts and video podcasts, we were considering including a link to getmiro.com in the respective application drop downs in the applications prefpane. The rational was that Windows does not currently ship with an application to download podcasts and video podcasts, and if the user only has Firefox and a fresh install of Windows, this feature would be useless. Even though analyzing RSS feeds got cut for Firefox 3, what do people think of potentially still including a bookmark in new profiles to getmiro.com? Pros: + Miro compliments the functionality of Firefox well. Firefox is all about consuming images and text, and Miro is all about consuming audio and video. With both applications, users will be able to consume every type of media delivered to them over the internet. + Miro provides a great user experience, so introducing Firefox users to Miro will improve their overall user experience with the internet, even though this now includes interactions outside of Firefox. + The Participatory Culture Foundation and the Mozilla Foundation have very similar goals and values. Cons: - Adding a bookmark to new profiles increases the complexity of our default UI (even if it only in the bookmarks menu, and not on the bookmarks toolbar). - Adding a bookmark takes us in the direction of the Netscape Whorebar (although this time around it is 501c3-free-and-open-Web whoring, which is perhaps a little more wholesome.) Overall I recognize that pre-populated bookmarks constitute incredibly valuable real estate, but I think including this particular bookmark will improve Firerfox users' experience with the internet, and it is something we should seriously consider.</description>

If not, is there a chance one will be made? Many .net devs find the IE control a bit difficult to work with (especially detecting when a page is completely done loading, especially pages with iframes, etc.) and MS has done nothing to make this easier, as well as wanting to use a better all around web browser object in their programs. I believe it would also make for great promotion of FF.

Same folders or bookmarks could appear on several topics. The topics should be customizable. Example: Step1: Select "purchasing" in the topic drop down - the rest of the toolbar is populated with folders "Computers Purch", "cars", "appliances", some bookmarks... Step2: Select "computers" in the topic drop down - the rest of the toolbar is populated with folders "development" "emulators" "Computers Purch", some bookmarks...

Often, I will have 20 windows open (and a couple tabs in some), and my cpu will be at 50%, my processor fan spinning up to full blast. Everything in ffox slows down. And then I close one particular window and all of a sudden everything is calm and smooth. I presently have no way to determine which window/tab/page is the hog, besides manually closing every one (and then reopening it if it's not the problem window).

      <title>context menu for getting RSS feeds</title>
      <description>I have verified that this occurs on both 2.0.0.7 and a trunk build (checked out 10/10), on my Mac OS X 10.4.10 system. Say I have loaded a blog page, such as http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/asa/. I see the RSS icon (with the tool tip "Subscribe to this page...") in the right side of the location bar. What if I want the feed URL for this site? I cannot find a way to see it, except that I can view the source and find the correct &lt;link&gt; tag. I thought that if I got the context menu over the RSS icon, I would get something like "Subscribe to Feed", "Copy Feed URL", etc. Instead I got the options to change the view of the toolbar. Why would I get that? I am not in the toolbar. I am in the location bar. Would it not make sense to have to context menu from the RSS icon do something with the RSS link information? Could one of the options be to show the feed URLs?</description>

FF does not start when called with: C:\PROGRA~1\MOZILL~1\FIREFOX.EXE -requestPending -osint -url However, it does start when called with C:\PROGRA~1\MOZILL~1\FIREFOX.EXE -requestPending -url -osint The solution to this problem is simple: rearrange the arguments given to FF in this specific registry entry Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Start FF by typing C:\PROGRA~1\MOZILL~1\FIREFOX.EXE -requestPending -osint -url 2. Nothing happens 3. Start FF by typing C:\PROGRA~1\MOZILL~1\FIREFOX.EXE -requestPending -url -osint 4.

      <title>Please add a preference for turning off autoscroll</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8.1.8) Gecko/20071008 Firefox/2.0.0.8 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8.1.8) Gecko/20071008 Firefox/2.0.0.8 On OS X, with the mighty mouse, I can click on the "middle button" on a link in most browsers, and it will open that link in a new tab. In fact, I can do that in firefox, EXCEPT if my finger slips, and I miss the link, then this virtual scrolling thing comes up, and acts like a 2d scroll wheel. This is quite annoying. I don't want that virtual scroll wheel. For one, my mighty mouse has an actual 2d scroll device on it (the middle button is actually a tiny trackball). For two, this function makes small mistakes into bigger frustrations (finger slips, miss the link, and now moving my mouse makes my browser scroll all over the page). I understand that for some people this is a GREAT feature. I don't want it removed entirely. I just want it to easily optional. And, if there's an advanced preference for it, please let me know what it is and how to disable it. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Go to a link 2. Click on the middle button, and slightly slip so that the middle button misses the link 3. Watch your browser window fly around because the virtual 2d scroll wheel is in effect. Actual Results: Annoying virtual 2d scroll wheel causes frustration. Expected Results: No 2d virtual scroll wheel should activate, because I don't need that feature.</description>

Usually it slides up progressively, some AJAX Web applications get slower when the alert bar is disappearing because it resizes page contents depending on window drawable size. So an additional option to tell the alert bar to disappear instantly instead of sliding would be appreciated. Reproducible: Didn't try Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

      <description>Created attachment 286272 [details] [diff] [review] patch Initially, there was a plan to add a slider to the status bar in bug 389628, but eventually there was "a distinct lack of consensus as to whether it's needed." So it landed without the slider. I'm not sure if we need a slider, but I have a patch since I had implemented it for bug 389628. Hence this bug.</description>

We already use the stock system gnome icons in the beautified ftp:// interface. Check ftp://ftp.somesite.org or file:///home under gnome and you will see the stock gnome icons. This means the we have the infrastructure backend to use those icons. The current folder icons in the bookmarks menu looks too much like windowsXP style icons. If we can use the system icons under gnome (Linux), this would slightly increase the usability and aesthetics of Firefox under Linux. Thanks you in advance for considering my enhancement request.

      <title>missing "Text Size" zoom feature, Full page zoom should be an option not replacement</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; ru; rv:1.8.1.8) Gecko/20071008 Firefox/2.0.0.8 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; ru; rv:1.8.1.8) Gecko/20071008 Firefox/2.0.0.8 As we can see in the latest trunk (Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9a9pre) Gecko/2007102605 Minefield/3.0a9pre), text size zoom is replaced with full page zoom, and there is no way to return usual text size zoom. But for many people (including yours faithfully) full page zoom is completely useless and moreover UNUSABLE. It's even often is one of reasons for people to prefer Firefox to Opera -- they just want to increase text size -- not images, not layout at all, text only -- for more comfortable READING only, not for any another purposes. Text size zoom is really advantageous distinction of Firefox from any other browser. So, if full page zoom will be turned on by default then an option to return old behavior should exist. (Though, in my humble opinion, expediency of turning full page zoom by default is VERY questionable, and ZOOM should be an option [for some Opera switchers, etc.] -- and text size turned on by default as it was in previous Firefox versions). Subject options, for example, may look like two radiobuttons in "View" -&gt; "Zoom" menu: - Zoom text only - Zoom full page with former option checked by default. This may be duplicated in hierarchy of main Firefox settings if needed (perhaps someplace in "Tools" -&gt; "Options" -&gt; "Content"). Thanks. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: Just try to resize text only -- you will get full page zoom instead. Then search for option to return old behavior -- there is nothing ways to do it. Actual Results: Text size zoom is replaced with full page zoom. Expected Results: Full page zoom should be an option, not default and only way to zoom text.</description>

      <description>when showing autocomplete result, show tags that partially match I was telling dan mills that for autocomplete results, if you have an exact match with a tag, we'll show you the tagged items (at the top of your autocomplete results) here's an idea for an enhancement: when typing "fire", if there is no "fire" tag, show an item corresponding to any tags that might match this text as the topmost result, like: "firefly firefox fireman". if you have no tags, you won't see anything. but if you use tags, this might prove a useful way to find tagged items (in case you don't remember what your tags are called.)</description>

      <description>FireFox's tools menu provides quick access to various "Managers", such as Download Manager, Extensions Manager, Themes Manager. Certificate Manager should be in that list, too.

      <title>Sidebar absent for short pages causes middle-alignment to shift with dynamic content.</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.8) Gecko/20071008 Firefox/2.0.0.8 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.8) Gecko/20071008 Firefox/2.0.0.8 In Firefox (or opera, or safari too) the sidebar is absent when the page contents are little. If page is center-aligned (which makes a good appearance), and some dynamic content is added and removed, then the middle alignment shifts to left when dynamic content is added, and to the right when dynamic content is removed. It causes ugly jitter. IE handles this by having a greyed-out sidebar when the page isn't long enough. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Go to any site with center-alignment and having dynamic content (like a tall image). 2. I can build one example if you don't find one. Expected Results: Well it's a suggested feature. Software isn't doing anything wrong.</description>

      <title>Replace "Check by asking Google about each site I visit" with a more-frequent-update option</title>
      <description>Currently, Firefox users have to choose between two anti-phishing modes: (o) Check using a downloaded list of suspected sites ( ) Check by asking [Google |v] about each site I visit This introduces an unnecessary tradeoff between protection and privacy. Instead, Firefox should have an option to check for updates to the list whenever the user visits a new hostname: [x] Update the list of suspected sites whenever I visit a new site. This would provide real-time protection with much less privacy impact: Google would only know that you visited a new site, not which site. I think it would also put less burden on Google's servers and Google's developers. Firefox should avoid requesting an update if it has been update in the last 2 minutes or so, in case a user is visiting a bunch of new sites at once. (Another possibility is to let users choose the update frequency: 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 30 minutes, etc. That would have even less privacy impact but would result in more requests to Google.)</description>

Where it automatically looks for other sources of the file you download, in order to speed up the download. Firefox should at the very minimum upgrade their existing download manager to allow proper pausing and unpausing of downloads on servers that allow it. At the moment the feature is completley broken. Firefox should also allow for a multi connected download, with automatic source search. Specifically a location search based on the country the download is originating from. Ie if you download from australia, it should try and find servers with close proximity. Finnaly, the download manager should include a bandwidth choke measure.

This is a request for an enhancement which should allow a better readability of page containing both RTL and LTR scripts. I assume that a good approach would be to distinguish the change of directionality in a BiDi text by vertically offsetting the text a few pixels. As it intended as an example the default rendering of the pages should be as it is now. Thanks for all your efforts in advance! Best regards Reinhardt [[user:Gangleri]] note: The wiki pages '&amp;action=credits' are generated automatically. The order of users mentioned there and the directionality of the user names is arbitrary. This is why the (originak) URL http://nike.users.idler.fi/dev/?title=Main_Page&amp;action=credits may render differently as seen in the screen dumps. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: please open the original URL ( http://nike.users.idler.fi/dev/?title=Main_Page&amp;action=credits ) and resize the window that way that נעבעך גוט משוגע renders on two lines.

      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.9) Gecko/20071025 Firefox/2.0.0.9 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.9) Gecko/20071025 Firefox/2.0.0.9 In the Bookmark sidebar, if you accidentally hit the Delete key while a bookmark folder is highlighted the folder is deleted with no warning or confirmation. This can wipe out a lot of information. Over the past year or two I've apparently done that twice (I'm not actually aware of hitting the Delete key, but a bookmark subfolder was gone so I must have.) Fortunately I've had a backup of my bookmarks file and was able to restore the whole thing -- once I noticed that something was missing. But in both cases I didn't immediately notice that something was missing. A confirmation should be required before deleting a bookmark folder, and probably also before deleting a single bookmark as well. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Display the Bookmarks Sidebar 2. In the Sidebar, highlight and delete a folder. Actual Results: The folder and all of the bookmarks that it contained will instantly be gone. Expected Results: Desired result is a request for confirmation before actually doing the delete.</description>

      <title>should be able to rename bookmark items with pressing F2</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.9) Gecko/20071025 Firefox/2.0.0.9 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.9) Gecko/20071025 Firefox/2.0.0.9 I have never seen an application that does not map the F2 key to the 'rename' function for whatever is needed. Within the bookmarks manager, it can be clearly seen that when a bookmark or folder is highlighted, and the F2 key is pressed, no action is taken to rename the node. There is a function accessible through the toolbar and the menubar (Edit-&gt;Properties), but is not mapped to the F2 key. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open Bookmarks Manager 2. Highlight a bookmark or folder 3. Press F2 Actual Results: Absolutely nothing. Hence the problem Expected Results: By design, exactly the same as it does. By accessibility standards, it should give some sort of rename function.</description>

      <title>Move throbber to where the URL bar site icon (favicon) is.</title>
      <description>Alex, beltzner, and mconnor designed this, I'm summarizing: * Remove the throbber from its current location on the toolbar. * Add throbber to where the favicon is in the URL bar. * The throbber, like the favicon and the URL, is tied to the tab being shown. * While the page is loading, you see the throbber, and when it finishes you get the favicon. [Just like how the throbber/icon on tabs currently works.] Why: * Brings load activity closer to the UI that affects throbbing (eg Stop, enter a URL, forward/back/reload). * A throbber here is useful for indicating activity as a Places search runs (as you're typing in the field) * One less icon in the primary UI (favicon is now overloaded, no standalone throbber) Known nits: * The "inactive throbber" state ceases to exist. [More precisely, a favicon is shown when the throbber is inactive.] This is highly desirable for integration consistency on OS X. * The throbber is no longer global, so if the only tab loading is hidden in tab overflow, there's no at-a-glance activity indication. * The favicon can load before the page is finished loading, but won't be shown until the page finishes loading and the throbber stops. Stalled loads would be the worst example of this. * This could be perceived as a flashing effect, where navigating within a site causes icon --&gt; throbber --&gt; icon --&gt; throbber --&gt; icon, etc. We already flash a little between the site icon and generic icon, although it can be subtle.</description>

      <title>Allow "star by default" behavior as an option</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.2; en-US; rv:1.9b2pre) Gecko/2007110807 Minefield/3.0b2pre Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.2; en-US; rv:1.9b2pre) Gecko/2007110807 Minefield/3.0b2pre I would like the option of starring-but-not-filing visited pages by default. This would allow me to keep, in effect, two histories. I'd like to keep a long, easily prunable history because I'm a hoarder. I like the security of knowing that I *could* find that page again, though I never will. Also, as an example, I'd like to keep a short history for link coloring. Knowing that I visited a link sometime in the last six months isn't useless, but close. I'd rather have *recently* followed links colored, for an indication of out-datedness, f'rinstance. Making starred pages a "persistent" history and expiring the regular history quickly seems like the best of both worlds. This is the equivalent of just manually starring most pages I visit, but I haven't been able to make that a strong enough habit to give up my long history. I'd rather clear out clutter later than risk expiring something I wanted to keep. I believe one of the original ideas behind Places was to move toward greater unification/integration of history and bookmarks, as "Places". This seems to me a step in that direction. Downsides: Loses a lot of the benefit of promoting starred pages in the URL bar autocomplete algorithm, but my impression is the URL bar is getting way smart about several different things, and may be able to hold it's own adequately. I'm ignorant of the performance implications, but two things--there is/will be a cap on number of bookmarks, which seems relevant, and, again, an early idea about Places was that it should offer an easy, lightweight way to star/tag, freely and with abandon, anything you think you *might* want to find again. If starring doesn't scale well enough, maybe it should. One last thought--how about middle-click unstarring a page, the way single-click stars it? The URL is the blog post that motivated me to finally get this bug submitted. Reproducible: Always</description>

Attempted removal of dcads will leave firefox in a state where it terminates on loading a page (presumably when dcads would attempt a popup). Removal of dcads is NOT TRIVIAL, I have not found anything that completely removes it. A system restore seems to have worked but even a reinstal of firefox didn't work the first time. Dcads appears to be a registry based popup generator. Even information on how to kill this thing would be helpful. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.Be an idiot and install an unknown .exe from Limewire (I clicked before I thought.) Instantly install @#$%#@ thing called dcads. 2.Try every known spy bot killer. Do System restore. 3. Actual Results: Visit various web pages i.e. oldversion.com &amp; fire fox evaporates. Expected Results: ?? Report that fire fox has been tampered with by an outside agent, Resist attempts to hook into the browser ??? No blame to you. But there appears to be so little info out there on this and there must be others experiencing this and it affects firefox directly. As of this moment, a system restore followed by a total uninstall and reinstall directly from the download "Seems" to have restored things to normal. I really wanted to select "Critical" from the severity below but decided instead to go with enhancement.</description>

      <title>Tabs opened from a page should spawn right after the current tab</title>

Suppose you go to the first tab, middle click to follow a link in another tab and it spawns at the end of the tabs list (probably hidden). I think it should be more appropriate to spawn tabs opened from another tab just after it. That way, even shortcut such as ctrl+page down could be very efficient. It's probably an easy to fix problem concerning a big hassle for the navigation and user experience (IMHO). Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open an handful of tabs. 2. Take on of the firsts 3. Middle click or right click-&gt;open link in new tab Actual Results: Opened tab is now at the very end of tab list, often invisible due to required scrolling. Expected Results: Tab should spawn as "next tab" in order to improve navigation between opened tab. Logical relationship between opened tab from current tab and this current tab is strong enough to allow that.</description>

In OS X firefox appears to only search /Library/Internet Plugins and ~/Library/Internet Plugins in addition to the directories inside the bundle (which I assume will be deleted on upgrade). Gecko Plugin API documentation says that MOZ_PLUGIN_PATH enviornment variable will allow the user to specify an additional plugin directory on windows and unix. This should work on OS X as well (or something else accomplishing the same function). I tried and it fails to work If I'm missing something simple that will fix this I apoligize but if so the documentation is really lacking. The plugin documentation (http://plugindoc.mozdev.org/) goes into some depth about plugin directories on windows and unix but is silent on OS X.

      <description>add "Compact" to "Organize" menu in the bookmarks organizer that does VACUUM (with progress) as discussed repeately (see bug #395020 and bug #394379), we aren't doing VACUUM yet as it blocks the UI. additionally, while vacuuming defrags the database, sqlite is good at reusing the freed page list, and I claim the typical user won't see / won't care about the size of the places.sqlite file on disk. but, that said, we might find ourselves needed to recommend vacuum for users after we ship firefox 3. note, we'd need a progress window for this (see bug #329736) as it can block the UI for a long period of time. an irc discussion about this: sspitzerMsgMe I just makred a vacuum bug from p1/m10 to p3/m11 dietrich yep, was just about to comment dietrich that's fine, given our new understanding of vacuum sspitzerMsgMe you should have gotten bug email. given what we now know sspitzerMsgMe right sspitzerMsgMe ok, coolness dietrich we really should get the "vacuum on upgrade" done though sspitzerMsgMe (glad we are on the same page) sspitzerMsgMe why do you think that is critical? dietrich as well as the move those inc. vacuum folks off of that sspitzerMsgMe well, keep in mind, that won't work. sspitzerMsgMe unless we fix vacuum sspitzerMsgMe to allow resetting of pragmas dietrich right, drh's suggestion of change pragma dietrich here's my thoughts: the most vocal and prolific testers we have all have inc. vacuum sspitzerMsgMe so, we'd need that first. and keep in mind, we'd have to vacuum all profiles (or do you mean, vacuum after first run after upgrade) dietrich and they'll continually have probs sspitzerMsgMe keep in mind, they might be configured for incremental vacuum, but we are no longer doing the incremental vacuum sspitzerMsgMe (we were not set up for auto) sspitzerMsgMe so they have databases configured for it, but we don't do it. dietrich oh right, regular vacuum will still work sspitzerMsgMe (anymore, on idle) dietrich we don't need to un-inc.vacuum them sspitzerMsgMe right. dietrich ok, maybe my concern is unfounded. dietrich i worry that ongoing usage will increase fragmentation to a point where vacuum will take so long that we don't want to do it dietrich and then there'll be really popular extensions for vacuuming dietrich :P sspitzerMsgMe I think we discussed this: sspitzerMsgMe some sort of file | compact sspitzerMsgMe in the organizer sspitzerMsgMe once we get prgress working dietrich yes we did dietrich maybe we should morph that bug dietrich to cover that sspitzerMsgMe or should I start a new one? dietrich yes, that's a better plan sspitzerMsgMe ok, doing that now. sspitzerMsgMe also: sspitzerMsgMe if we had a vacuum that could change pragmas, and if we had progress ui, we could do a vacuum on startup (do a schema bump). I don't think we want to add this code to software update / installer. sspitzerMsgMe multiple profiles on a machine or multiple profiles for a given user makes this very messy. sspitzerMsgMe keep in mind, all we are gaining is a smaller places.sqlite file on disk. sspitzerMsgMe (and sqlite should be re-using freed pages) sspitzerMsgMe I guess, there is a price to be paid if you have a place.sqlite site up for incremental vacuum sspitzerMsgMe dr. hipp tells me there is some overhead dietrich yes, and new users should already have that smaller places.sqlite sspitzerMsgMe but he made it sound like it was minimal. sspitzerMsgMe as long as you don't do an incremental vacuum dietrich hm sspitzerMsgMe (or have auto enabled, and we don't) sspitzerMsgMe I think we should log the bug about "file | compact" and punt on vacuum. I could defniitely ship b2 even rtm without vacuum. dietrich ok, i think we should change bug 395020 to be only about single-profile-vacuum-on-upgrade, as you just described dietrich and block it on the progress UI bug sspitzerMsgMe ok, will do sspitzerMsgMe I'll post this chat log sspitzerMsgMe in the bug as well sspitzerMsgMe for reference. sspitzerMsgMe ok? dietrich right, new bug for vacuum on organizer sspitzerMsgMe right, will do that too. dietrich change bug 395020 and recommend de-blockerizing it</description>

It's quite annoying that if you search for a specific pattern in cookie, get 10 cookies result you have to mark them first, then delete. A "select all" would be good. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open Cookie Mgr 2. Enter a search pattern 3.

      <title>Provide a shortcut to directly open the Bookmarks Toolbar.</title>
      <description>Right now, to get to the Places folder using the keyboard, one has to press Alt+B for the Bookmarks menu, the letter b three times to get to the "Bookmarks Toolbar Folder" sub menu, RightArrow, which lands you on "Places", and RightArrow again to get to the "Recently starred" item. Alternatively, you'd press Ctrl+B for Organize Bookmarks, and navigate to the Places folder in the TreeView, which is also not convenient. Suggestion: Introduce a keystroke, for example Alt+P, which opens the Places folder directly.</description>

      <title>Add history/visit info to the main Larry dialog</title>
      <description>Currently the Larry dialog is a bit dry and cold, while the secondary information panel (that you get when you click "Tell me more about this web site...") has much friendlier and more approachable information. I think it would be nice to have that friendlier info in the main dialog, so when you click Larry he tells you helpful things like: * You have visited this web site 34 times before * This web site is storing cookies on your computer (view cookies) * You have 1 saved password for this web site (view password) From the user's perspective I think this is much more useful information than "foobar.com has been validated by X-Ramp Security Services" since users probably won't have any idea who X-Ramp Security Services are.</description>

It would be more helpful to also include a submenu with all the search engines the user has added to Firefox. Since sometimes I want to use Google ( my default Firefox search engine ) to search for the selected text, other times, I want to use Logos or Merriam-Webster Dictionary. For example, my suggested context menu would be something like this: Search &lt;default_search_engine&gt; for "&lt;selected text&gt;" Search for "&lt;selected text" With -&gt; submenu: google, logos, wikipedia, etc..

I deleted a bunch of yahoo cookies while debugging, not knowing this would happen and then had a devil of a time discovering that Firefox was now blocking the entire site (yahoo's dumb messages did not help much either). I sorta see why someone would want the reverse (delete the cookie when I block a site), but this approach seems excessive. I want to proactively block sites, not via deleting cookies. Can this be made an option -- or at least documented?? Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Go into View Cookies and delete one or more at the &gt;TOP level: eg, yahoo.com 2. Look everywhere to see why you cannot log onto yahoo -- over and over you are returned to the login page with no messages; finally it tells you your browser is not accepting cookies. WTF? Another browser works. WTF? 3. Go into Firefox Exceptions and see the site is now blocked 4. Hit head on desk given you just wasted an hour trying to get into yahoo mail Actual Results: Site was blocked Expected Results: Site would be blocked. Either ask me if I want all my deleted cookies to result in a Blocked site or at the least document that will do this when I delete cookies.</description>

With the increased data storage that places gives, I would expect that to become a more common occurrence. Reproducible: Didn't try Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

So very clear statement: I would like to add the following feature to firefox: In Tools -&gt;Options-&gt;Advanced-&gt;Network-&gt;Connections add two fields: proxy username and password, so store the proxy authentication there. Hundreds of tools out there seem to have this but not firefox. Just have a look at the preferences to - ClamWin (proxy, username password) - Exact Audio Copy (proxy username, password) - LogMeIn (proxy, username, password). - Windows Live Messenger (proxy, username, password) - Mediamonkey (proxy, username, password) etc. etc. etc. Side effects to this feature missing are that checking for updates will time-out if I do not press ok to send the (pre-filled and remembered password) same is true for soem extensions that connect to the web in the same way (ie. chipmarks) etc. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.Setup a proxy that uses authentication 2.Start-up firefox: it will ask for username password 3.Check: remember password close firefox 4.Start firefox: it will remember username password but I still have to press ok.</description>

The form of the pop-up is to be discussed. My best guess is that it should contain visual previews and appear in unobtrusive way (possible solution is a transparent pop-up at the bottom of window, another is transparent vertical pop-up on the left side) and disappear after some time of inactivity - or after activity like clicking out of pop-up.

There are two things that should be done: ## Provide separate icons in PNG format for the commonly used sizes 16x16, 22x22, 24x24, 32x32 and 48x48. All with nice alpha and AA. Not just scaled down versions but tweaked versions to better fir the smaller sizes. If possible, also provide a scalable version of the logo in SVG format. This would fix the look of the Application launcher in the menu. ## Don't use a fixed size icon for the window icon. The current icon (48x48?) looks very blurry in the window list (scaled down to 16x16) but looks pixelized in window previews, scale and the task switcher. GTK apps have a mechanism to pick up the right size of the icon from share/icons/hicolor/apps/$SIZE/$APPNAME.png Reproducible: Always</description>

      <title>Show keyboard shortcuts (⌘1 through ⌘9) in the "All Tabs" menu</title>
      <description>The "All Tabs" menu should show the numerical shortcuts for each of the first eight tabs and the last tab. This would make it easier for users to discover these nifty shortcuts. I'll let you guys fight over whether the last tab should show ⌘5 or ⌘9 when there are only five tabs (since ⌘9 is special and always goes to the last tab). UI precedent: Safari uses ⌘1 through ⌘9 for bookmarks toolbar items and shows the shortcuts in the "bookmarks bar" submenu of the bookmarks menu.</description>

So the program is using three different words to identify the task at hand: Restore, Revert and Replace. I think, in the warning dialog that pops up, the title should be Restore Bookmarks, and the text of the dialog is fine as it is now, or perhaps could say "Restoring Bookmarks will replace all your current bookmarks with the backup. Are you sure?" Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.Choose restore from the import and backup menu in Places 2. 3. Actual Results: The user may be confused because the dialog that then appears is called "Revert Bookmarks", rather than "Restore Boomarks", and in its text talks about "replacing". Expected Results: Use consistent wording for the task at hand. See the summary for what might be a better title for the dialog, and better wording within it.</description>

After seeing the Windows version of FF 3 (Beta 1), which looks as expected. I hope that the Mac OS X version will get the same treatment.

      <title>Feature enhancement : show multiple search results in multiple tabbed pages.</title>

E.g. : you search for "Russia" in Wikipedia, but also at the same time in Google, Yahoo, and you display the result in as many tabs as needed (eg 3 in you searched in three engines, 4 if you search in four). This means that in "Manage Search Engines" one is able to choose multiple default search engines. This enables to show a lot of different inputs of the Internet in one click in FireFox and, as far as I know, Firefox would be the first browser to do it ! It would be especially be helpful also on Intranets, to search in multiple specific applications for which search engines have been developped. Thanks in advance !

      <title>Inform users on install that they are part of the Beta Program</title>
      <description>Currently we have the situation that users are not informed on install that they are part of the Firefox Beta Program. You only notice this with RC Updates (for Firefox 2.x) and with a modified Startup page. When you install a Firefox 3 Beta 1 as example you get no notice that this beta program is also valid for later Firefox 3 Security Releases (like Firefox 3.0.0.1) and does not end with the Firefox 3 Release. Maybe we could add a notice to the installer ("You are about to install a Firefox Beta Version and you are now part of the Firefox Beta Community [maybe with a included hardcoded link to a page what "beta program" mean), or with a Checkbox in the Installer like: default [x][yes i want to be part of the Firefox Beta Program]-&gt; "beta" update channel and if they uncheck this the update channel is "release" This would help to get more awareness of the Firefox Beta Program and also help to get more feedback from beta users.</description>

So for instance, if I load a mobile website in the sidebar and click on a link in the website loaded in the sidebar it will automatically open over the top of an existing tab(this bug is already reported elsewhere). The point is that it would be great if there was some sort of option to open that link in the sidebar. Several possible solutions would include: 1) an option to control this behavior under tools&gt;options 2) a toggle in the sidebar itself so that if someone was using a feature that they wanted to open out into new tabs such as clicking on a normal bookmark that they could quickly change the behavior. 3) a sidebar context menu item that would allow the link to be opened in the sidebar. This last is probably a separate request, but if you are going to allow opening sidebar website links in the sidebar, being able to move backward and forward through pages would be nice too.

      <title>Search in bookmarks title for the autocomplete results</title>
      <description>Right now, the autocomplete results is matching bookmark tags, document titles and document urls. However the result do not take the bookmark title into account. This is not an issue when using the default bookmark title, because it is filled by the document title which will be matched in the autocomplete results. However, when changing the bookmark name (for instance, if the document has no title or a meaningless one), that would be great to see it appear in the autocomplete results. Steps to reproduce: 1) open www.firefox.com 2) bookmark the page (&lt;ctrl&gt;-d), and set a name to "foobar" 3) type "foobar" in the address bar expected: I see the url matching that bookmark actual result: no match This would be related to bug 399664. In this situation, the overridden bookmark title should be displayed instead if the document one.</description>

      <title>RSS Reading in Places</title>
      <description>Livemarks seem to be very powerful and I think Places Organizer would deserve a special lace for them. I'm thinking about a special "root" (like "Tags") for feeds. Inside this root, lifemarks could be put and opened similar to tags: the items in that livemark would display in the upper right pane. This currently works when I just create my own "Feeds" folder in Places. The interesting bit would be a special handling in the bottom right pane for livemark items. displaying name and URL is fine, but IMHO tags are not really needed here (or will lifemark feeds be saved infinitely?). What we would need is a preview area for the feed item. This would transform places into a great feed reader, eliminating the need to have another app just for this.</description>

In my opinion, the option in uninstaller "remove my Firefox personal data and customization" should be disabled. That's because many people would check that option and would loose their personal files also from Firefox 2. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3. Firefox 2 already installed on the machine.</description>

      <title>Window menu should show a submenu for each window that has multiple tabs, which lists the tabs in that window</title>
      <description>The situation: after a day of working and browsing and so forth, I have 10 or 15 windows open, several of which have 5 or 10 tabs in them. I'm looking for a specific tab, and I don't remember which window it's in, and it's not the frontmost tab in that window. I wind up having to cycle through all of the windows trying to find one with that tab in it. A great way to fix this would be to have all of the tabs in each window listed in a submenu under that window in the Window menu in the menu bar.</description>

      <title>location bar autocomplete  &amp; shift-delete</title>
      <description>A regression from bug 403159 (Switch location bar auto-complete to a two line view). When I hover over 1 of the entries, I can press shift-delete to delete the entry from the list. That works, but the highlight isn't restored when a new entry (the one just below the entry just deleted) slides under the cursor. As a result, you can't keep pressing shift-delete to delete several entries. You have to nudge your mouse a little bit, so that its movement triggers the re-appearance of the highlight. That was the behavior of the old location bar, for instance in Firefox 2.0.0.11.</description>

      <description>This is the first issue mentioned in bug 402195. Page Info doesn't tell you what the encryption type is, if 1 part was encrypted, and 1 part was plain text. Example: &lt;https://www.opends.org/&gt;, which calls some Javascript-code (a Google urchinTracker) at the bottom over http. I suspect that the same problem happens when you have multiple types of encryption types on a single page. Or multiple certificates. I'll try to look for an example.</description>

However, as many of them are similar and/or do not post very often, I've used tools like feedjumbler to merge them into 10 feeds. This works ok, but sometimes it would be nice to know where the link comes from if you are in a hurry. This could be solved beautifully by giving each feed the favicon of their motherpage, but as firefox doesn't know they aren't from the same page, this won't be possible. Only by having firefox merge the feeds itself, can this work. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

      <title>Make it possible to restore all but one tab</title>
      <description>Right now, if a user crashes, he gets two options when restarting: 1) Restore everything 2) Restore nothing In most cases, he wants option 1. But if he happened to open a page that crashes reliably, then option 2 is the only one that will allow the user to make progress. Emma recently bemoaned the fact that she runs into this with some regularity on some sites thanks to the tender mercies of the Quicktime plug-in. What she'd really like is a way to restore all the pages except the one that she knows crashed. She'd be happy to select it from a list or some such (as in, she's not expecting the browser to know which page caused the crash). Not sure how to create good UI for this, but the functionality would be great to have.</description>

      <title>Top autocomplete match results can be improved</title>
      <description>Autocomplete match results should be influenced by where in strings the letters match. Right now when I type 1 or 2 characters I often get poor results from the autocomplete matches. For example, if I type the letter g, I get everything I've visited that has the letter g *anywhere* in the name. The top results almost never have what I want. For example, "Drinking is a fine art" is a bad match for just "g", and should come after "gizmodo.com" and "Good morning Vietnam". Chances are I am looking for g[something].[com|net|etc]/something or for something with a word that starts with a g. I'm not sure if we're using a point scoring system for position in the list, but we could do something like this: Matches score higher points and bubble closer to the top of the list when there is a match with 1. The start of the domain name or title + 30 points 2. The start of an associated tag + 20 points 3. The start of a word in the path or the title + 10 points (where word is a letter after a space or punctuation) 4. Any part of the URL or title + 0 points The frequency of visits, how recent a visit was, whether it's starred, whether that match has been selected for these characters before, etc. would continue to do what they do -- they would also get various amounts of points. I'm thinking of it in terms of a fuzzy, point scoring system where all of these things factor in but don't completely take over the suggestion placement logic.</description>

      <description>The Awesomebar makes bookmarking pages a wonderful experience. One next step: It may already be in the plans for the next version, but it'd be great if one could set up filters that bookmarks will follow to determine what folder the bookmark is filed in. An analogy to this is the email filters we all use on gmail or yahoo to apply labels to incoming messages or move them to some folder. Example: set *google* to go in to the Google bookmark folder when clicking on the star. Tada! No need to reorganize your bookmarks every now and then.</description>

      <title>Add --disable-target-xpidl to Mozilla</title>
      <description>Created attachment 325972 [details] [diff] [review] Add --disable-target-xpidl option When cross compile Mozilla from Linux for Windows platform, making a target xpidl is not an easy thing. You need to cross compile glib and then libIDL. And you also should tell some pkg-config where can find the include and libraries files. Sometime, such as doing a statically analysis for Windows code on a Linux platform using cross compiling, it is not necessary to make a target XPIDL. So, I think it is better to add a new --disable-target-xpidl option to Mozilla configure.</description>

Additionally, the warnings for untrusted certificates and certificates that are issued for the "wrong" domain (for example with "www" in front of it) are very similar now, while they were clearly different in FF2. I suggest to: - create an hidden about:config option "show quick SSL error buttons" which makes the following buttons appear on the ssl warning page: "ignore warning, connect insecurely", "show certificate" and "trust certificate". - make the "valid cert but wrong domain" and "expired" warnings clearly distinct from the "invalid cert" dialog (maybe only in the "ssl expert mode") - AND/OR - - create an hidden about:config option "use old SSL warning method" - add an option to remember the decision to the old "wrong domain" dialog Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: Visit any page with self-signed SSL certificate - OR - visit https://google.com - OR - set system time to a date in 2012 and visit any SSL secured site.</description>

Currently and with FF 3.0 you can have some information when you double click on the colored part in the URL and then click 'More information' button.

It is possible to compile a 64-bit version of Firefox, as I have done. 64-bit is quickly becoming the new standard. It would also be nice if there were official versions for other processor architectures such as MIPS, ARM, SPARC, PPC, etc. I know it is possible to run 32-bit i386 binaries on X86-64 or one of the other processor architectures (with QEMU), but this is really just a backward compatibility mode and it should be avoided if possible. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: N/A Actual Results: N/A Expected Results: There should be an official 64-bit version. It would also be nice if Mozilla officially supported more operating systems (or at least provided unofficial binaries) for OSes such as *BSD, Solaris, IRIX, BeOS, etc. An important program like Firefox should officially support more than just 3 OSes.</description>

      <description>From the idea of Joshua Dimmack, in Bug 413442 comment #11. If you right click on a Live Bookmark folder, you can notice there's not an option to open the homepage of Live Bookmarks. Since currently the link to the homepage is placed after all feed links, it's uncomfortable to reach it if there's much feeds. An homepage item for the context menu can resolve this problem.</description>

Now came along Firefox 3 with this awesome functionality of bookmarking sites along with tags. I'm interested in placing such a "bookmark me" button on my webpage that would automatically add the page to the browser's favorites, but in addition, will bookmark it with a list of predefined tags -- so that when the user writes these tags in the location bar, my site would pop up as a possible suggestion. For example, if I have a website that features a real estate business, I want to have a "Add me to Firefox 3's favorites" button on the page itself, that when pressing it, will automatically bookmark that page with the tags "real estate", "buildings", and "house". Is that possible? Can you develop a script that does such a thing? And if the script can co-handle other browsers as well that is even better.

      <title>site-specific dynamic search plugin and change of method of adding auto-discovered search plugins</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0 It's quite a hassle that you have to permanently add a site's search plugin before you can use it, especially because you don't know just what, specifically, the site's search field will do until you use it. This is especially a problem when a site has options on its HTML search field, or even multiple search fields, that it can't expose to the toolbar search, and thus has to guess at some "useful default" options. I propose that, instead of the current "Add X" menu entry on the search plugins dropdown list, there instead be a "dynamic search plugin." That is, it will appear, whenever a search plugin has been auto-discovered from a &lt;link rel="search"&gt; tag, after the horizontal rule in the list, that whatever search plugin has been discovered has already been installed and is ready to use. It may be necessary to pre-fetch the search plugin XML files to achieve this, if you want to use the search plugin's real icon, or the dynamic plugin could be more statically displayed as the site's favicon with a small search overlay icon (similar to the shortcut overlays in the WIMP metaphor.) When you first attempt to actually perform a search using a search plugin displayed dynamically by this "dynamic search plugin" menu entry (that is, every time you first use the dynamic entry after auto-discovery of a new search plugin, not just the first time you use the menu entry), that search plugin's required data will be downloaded just-in-time and stored temporarily. It will not be added to the search plugins list or dropdown yet. As long as the "dynamic search plugin" menu entry is focused, however, there will be some extra bit of chrome--I'm imagining something similar to the bookmarking star in the smart location bar--located in the toolbar search box. This button will permanently add the current auto-discovered search plugin to the bottom of the search plugins list, and make it the active search plugin rather than the dynamic entry. This button could, like the smart bar's, be displayed at all times in different visual states, and allow for things such as removing the active search plugin and configuring options (this wouldn't require any additional chrome of a search plugin option dialog--it would simply forward the user to the site's hypothetical "plugin configuration page", had it one listed in its search plugin XML, that would likely just set a cookie of search preferences that the search plugin's server-side script would refer to from then on.) There is the additional problem of what happens when the dynamic search plugin is focused and travel to a different website. There are two obvious sub-cases: Sub-case A: When you travel to a website with a different auto-discoverable search plugin, the dynamic search plugin entry will simply change to reflect the new discovery. The problem here is of the previously mentioned behavior where the "static" version of the search plugin will become active once it is added permanently. If users wish to use the dynamic entry for long periods of time, they will find this behavior grating. Perhaps there could be a preference in the Options dialog as to whether the dynamic search menu item will remain focused after you add the item or not, if a good default behavior cannot be determined for this case (I have doubts as to whether all that many people will really use the dynamic plugin entry for long periods. This would require user testing.) Sub-case B: When you travel to a site without a discoverable search plugin, a different search plugin will have to be made active, or the search toolbar should attain a disabled appearance until one is. If a different search plugin becomes active, there would be the question of which one should be. Most users would likely want it to be the one at the top of their search plugins list, as that plugin is optimized for access both through the search plugins dropdown and by pegging the Ctrl+Up shortcut key when in the search toolbar, and therefore a user's likely default. However, they may, alternately, want the last search plugin they were using before they activated the dynamic search plugin to be returned to, especially if they only use the dynamic search plugin entry for short periods of time. Then comes the question of whether this search plugin has been permanently focused, or whether the dynamic search plugin entry will be re-activated when the users go on to visit another site with a discoverable search plugin. Users would likely find this "jumpy" behavior confusing, and so whatever "backup" plugin is activated should likely remain so. Reproducible: Always</description>

      <title>RFE:  Pop-up blocker dialog should have a "show this pop-up AND allow pop-ups for this site"</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008061712 Fedora/3.0-1.fc9 Firefox/3.0 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008061712 Fedora/3.0-1.fc9 Firefox/3.0 Currently, if I want a site to be allowed to show me pop-ups forever and always AND see the relevant pop-up window loaded, I must first go to the pop-up blocker dialog and choose "allow pop-ups from this site." If the pop-up is generated by clicking a link on a page first, I must then go click the link again. It sure would be convenient to have the option of "Show this pop-up and allow from &lt;site&gt;". Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Go to MLB website http://mlb.mlb.com/index.jsp 2. In the flash window on the left that has the daily scoreboard, click the "Gameday" icon for a game currently being played (It's a small icon the shape of a baseball diamond). 3. Choose "allow popups from mlb.mlb.com" and then go click the link again to actaully see the new window. Actual Results: Frustrating UI that makes me click the link twice. Does this have anything to do with the popup being generated by the flash plugin ? For the record, I'm using Adobe flash plugin 9.0r124.</description>

      <title>option to disable preloading of tabs opened in background</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0 Sometimes I have hundreds of tabs open. Seeing as I only have 512MB of RAM and half is already stolen by the OS, this is a problem. However, I use tabs in a very specific way: as a reading/reviewing queue. I have hundreds open, but I only use the first two or three on the very left, opening new tabs off of them and then closing the original tab, sort of maintaining a FIFO where tabs push onto the right and shift off the left. In this situation, I can solve all my memory woes, for myself and perhaps quite a few others, with a little optimization: create a method of opening tabs (via some combination of modifier keys and the mouse, or on the link context menu) that not only keeps the current tab focused, but doesn't actually attach a parsing or rendering state to the unfocused tab. In other words, the tab is simply a URL or a prefetched set of source code and images, left in an inactive and compressed form. When the tab is first focused, the parser and renderer will fire off, throwing objects into memory, setting up a DOM, and uncompressing images for display, but until then, a tab that is "suspended" in such a way should occupy no more than a few kilobytes of memory. In fact, if such a tab is focused but then unfocused again without any interaction to the tab's webpage on the user's part (that is, simply by being paged through along the tab bar), the rendering state can be thrown away again after the tab is unfocused (and perhaps a certain amount of time elapsed to guarantee that the user won't return.) Javascript onload and onmouseover handlers may pose a problem to the definition of "on the user's part", but it would be simple enough to say that any page with those handlers attached wouldn't unload once loaded. Displaying such tabs a bit differently--say, with a "cryogenic" blue tint ;)--would be nice, but perhaps better left to an extension. There should be some means of identifying the tabs, both in the tab bar and tab dropdown list, though; it would be inconvenient, to sat the least, to be holding Ctrl+PgDn and then encounter an area of tabs that all act as if they were just opened when you encounter them. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Go to a site such as Wikipedia or Everything2--something deeply linked. 2. Start exploring, using only your middle mouse-button and the "close tab" button. Do not focus any tabs other than the first in your tab bar while doing this. 3. Repeat 2 until you have N tabs open, where N is such that Firefox takes up all of your computer's memory, and is well into your swap file. Actual Results: Your computer will take 30-40 seconds to open a page, minutes to save the session to disk if you quit (and Firefox will continue to be open, working in the background for minutes, without any visual evidence to this fact), and perhaps up to half an hour to re-open from this saved session. Expected Results: Firefox will respond almost exactly as if you had only one tab open, which, practically, you do.</description>

      <title>Hide "Most Visited" if history is disabled</title>
      <description>My dad has history disabled. When he upgraded to Firefox 3, Firefox placed a "Most Visited" menu on his bookmarks toolbar, but it was empty, and therefore not very useful. I think Firefox should either A) Not add the "Most Visited" folder to the bookmarks toolbar if history is disabled when the upgrade occurs or B) Hide the "Most Visited" folder if history is disabled, even if history becomes disabled after the folder is already there.</description>

      <title>SessionStore does not always save hideable window features</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0 Looking at the code the SessionStore component code, it looks like it is supposed to be saving the hideable window features (see below) such that if one or more of these is hidden in the browser window, a "hidden" variable is supposed to be created to store the hidden window features for restoration later. The "hidden" variable is never created when any of these is hidden. The code which checks for hidden elements is in the _updateWindowFeatures function as follows: const WINDOW_HIDEABLE_FEATURES = [ "menubar", "toolbar", "locationbar", "personalbar", "statusbar", "scrollbars" ]; var hidden = WINDOW_HIDEABLE_FEATURES.filter(function(aItem) { return aWindow[aItem] &amp;&amp; !aWindow[aItem].visible; }); The problem is that when any of these items are hidden, they aren't setting the variables that the code is checking. For example hiding the status bar doesn't set a window["statusbar"] variable. It set's the "hidden" attribute on the "status-bar" element. So the visible status of the status bar isn't correctly saved. In addition, many of the other items in the WINDOW_HIDEABLE_FEATURES array don't even appear to correctly reference the element that they are referring too. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Hide the status bar using the View menu and crash the browser 2. Choose to restore the session when starting the browser. Actual Results: Status bar is visible Expected Results: Status bar should not be visible It looks like this piece of code may be left over from the old Crash Recovery extension in that it appears to be looking for Mozilla suite data.</description>

Perhaps there should be some "file upload progress" implementation? The StatusBar can sort of tell you, but not exactly. Perhaps there should be in the progress bar (Uploading File Data: 8%) or something? It would be useful, especially when uploading large amounts of data, or you are on a slow connection. Some sites do have progress bars built in, but not all sites (Ex Gmail), so it would be usefull. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Go to a site that allows upload files to (Ex. gmail) 2. Upload a file (Attach a large file in gmail, and send it) 3. Wait impatiently Actual Results: You must just sit, wait, and wonder how long it will take. Expected Results: Your browser could report to you the progress, rather then rely on the website.</description>

      <title>May access personal certificates from other people without security check</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.2; es-ES; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.2; es-ES; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0 I have four personal certificates installed on firefox at my home's computer (One is mine, the other of my relatives) I backed up them with high security level, so I am prompted for a password every time I install one of them The problem, is that once installed, I may use any of them, and I am never prompted for a password again. Firefox just prompts to ask which certificate I want to use. And the worst problem is that they are all official documents emmited by spanish government, so any one using the computer may suplant me, which is a quite serious issue. Ok, they are my family and I trust them, but that's not always the case. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Install several personal certificates 2. Configure firefox to ask which certificate to use every time you are requested Actual Results: No security check when personal certificates are used (only when installed). May use any installed certificate installed on the browser with no security restrictions Expected Results: Should ask for a password every time a personal certificate is requested and selected. Password should be different for every certificate, and should be requested when certificate is installed. User may deactivate security on a certificate by certificate basis (Prompted for password to deactivate). This function might not be globally deactivated, but browser may be configured not to put security on certificates by default (Not request a usage password when certificate is installed) Secured certificates should be protected, so they can't be used just by copying them to another profile. It's a new feature, but I think is a major security problem (a problem shared by any browser I know)</description>

Firefox doesn't seem to support the CSS3 property "word-break" or the HMTL-textarea porperty "brek="hard" etc. This is a crucial feature, supportet by mostly all other browsers - and wee need it bad! :) Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.Create an HTML-textarea 2.Write a raelly long word with no spaces (For example: "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa" 3. Watch the horisontal scrollbars appear instead og the word being broken. Actual Results: Well - Firefox creates a horisontal scrollbar, insted of breaking the word. Expected Results: The word should be broken when it exceeds the width of it's container. This is a croucial CSS proporty for a lot of scenarios and should be fixed ASAP (Please, and with suggar on top :D)</description>

      <title>Add option for global default zoom level</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0 In the current Firefox 3 beta (see build identifier), using the new full zoom feature (*not* the font size zooming) is done on a per-domain setting; that is, each domain is associated with a stored zoom level, and all pages from that domain are rendered using that stored level. Currently, the default level can not be set, so each new domain that is encountered starts at 100% (normal) zoom. It would be appropriate to also have a user-defined default level which would allow new domains (domains that the user has not previously associated with a different zoom level via CTRL++ or similar) to initially be rendered at a zoom level other than 100%. See the issue URL for a forum thread that contains alternate wordings of this feature request (the thread is *not* by the same author as this issue request). Reasoning: People with poor eyesight, people with high-res LCD screens, or people with non-standard monitors may have to change the full-zoom setting for each and every domain that they visit. While the user could change screen resolution (on some operating systems and devices), change the default font size, or remove site-specific full-zoom settings, these methods may be undesirable for a variety of reasons (e.g. "I do not wish to change global resolution," "overriding the font size breaks layout on some pages", "I wish to keep site-specific full-zoom behavior"). Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open Firefox 3 (see build identifier for complete version information) 2. Open a page that has no previously associated full-zoom setting, that is, open a page on a domain that has never been visited before on this machine. Alternatively, the settings for installation of Firefox 3 may be set to "factory defaults" before launching the instance in step (1). 3. Use the full zoom feature (CTRL++ by default) to set this page to an arbitrary zoom level (e.g., press CTRL++ three times). 4. It a new tab, open another page on the same domain as the page in step (3). 5. Verify that that the page opened in step (4) has the same full-zoom setting as the page opened in step (4). 6. In a new tab, open a page on a different domain that has no previously associated full-zoom setting (i.e., repeat step (2)). 7. Verify that the full-zoom setting in the page opened in step (6) is different from the full-zoom setting in the page opened in step (4). 8. In a new tab. open address "about:config", without the quotes. 9. In the "Filter" text box, type "zoom", without the quotes. 10. Verify that there is no "default zoom level" or similar option. Actual Results: -NA- [feature request] Steps to reproduce contains directions that highlight the details of this feature request (no option for "default full-zoom level"). Expected Results: The requested feature would allow for a "default full-zoom level" option.</description>

      <title>FUEL: Allow event listeners for all events.</title>
      <description>Currently Application.events only observers a handful of events; app-startup final-ui-startup quit-application-requested xpcom-shutdown Which are abstracted to nicer FUEL names of; load ready quit unload But there is a whole range of other events that extension developers would like to listen to without dealing with writing an XPCOM interface to do so. It would be nice if the events system in FUEL would allow you to add simple functions as listeners to all events. http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Observer_Notifications It's really nice how FUEL has created simpler names for a handful of events but it would still be nice to get at all the other events you haven't exposed yet.</description>

Currently, the update does not occur until the field loses focus. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Choose a bookmark in the Bookmark Library, e.g. from Bookmarks (menu) --&gt; Organize Bookmarks (menu). 2. Change name in lower panel. 3. Press enter/return. Actual Results: UI is not updated until field loses focus. Expected Results: UI is updated.</description>

      <title>Full screen capture bar height should be customizable (and hideable)</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0 When running Firefox 3.0 in fullscreen mode (using F11), a 5px bar appears at the top. I will call this bar the "capture bar" as I have not seen it named anywhere else. Please suggest a better name if one exists. In Firefox 2 with the Fullerscreen Add-on, it was possible to switch to a view in which the client area consumed 100% of the screen real estate. It appears that in Firefox 3 with the built-in fullscreen capability, it is not possible to assign the client area 100% of the screen as the first five vertical pixels are reserved for the capture bar. I propose a simple enhancement which is a configuration value for the height of the capture bar, with allowed values including 0px. This feature would enable the user to customize the size of this window as well as effectively disable it by making it a zero height. The developer/implementer may choose to instead implement this as an enabled/disabled flag, although this provides less customization for the user. This enhancement is related-to, but distinct from #422867, which has come to address the issue of the capture bar appearing when no toolbars are present. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

      <title>Mouse capture window height should be independent of the visible height</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0 This is an extension to the enhancement described in #443184. One could have a second customization option, which is the height of the space that will trigger the toolbar to appear. This is similar, although potentially distinct, from the height of the visible capture bar. By default, they should be the same... but one could conceive of having a 0-height capture bar, but retain a region in which the toolbar will still appear if the mouse enters that space. This aspect of the enhancement is potentially much more complicated, because it involves space on the screen that in confounded: i.e. an HTML element could be listening for mouse events in the same space that the toolbar trigger window is also expecting events.

      <title>Deleted Bookmarks are not sent to the Recycle Bin, so accidental deletions are unrecoverable.</title>

Internet Explorer 6 sends deleted bookmarks to the Recycle Bin. Firefox should, too. . . . Things sent to the Recycle Bin can be recovered. As is, Firefox does not provide a means of recovering an accidentally deleted Bookmark. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.Click Bookmarks, click Organize Bookmarks 2.Click New Folder icon, name it _New Folder, description: Test for bug report 3.Right click the new folder, click Delete 4.Open Recycle Bin - it is empty (if it was empty before test) Actual Results: The deleted Bookmark was not in Recycle Bin and I can find no way to recover a deleted Bookmark.

      <title>Cookie "Exceptions" Should Not Take Precedence Over "Accept third-party cookies"</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0 Hi, In Firefox 3 Cookie "Exceptions" currently take precedence over the "Accept third-party cookies" privacy cookies option. Why? Would would anyone want to add a cookie exception when third-party cookies are disabled and yet have that exception allow third-party cookies? The whole point in disabling third-party cookies in the first place is for privacy. Exceptions should follow the rules set in place. If I do allow third-party cookies than a cookie exception should too. So basically to fix this issue cookie exceptions simply need to respect the "Accept third-party cookies" privacy cookie option. To see how this works in Firefox 3 please follow this short and simple example: I have disabled "Accept third-party cookies" and have set two "allow for session" cookie exceptions for grc.com and grctech.com . I then run the following test: http://www.grc.com/cookies/context.htm . Click "Test Cookie Context Management" and then click "Back to Cookie Forensics" . Once the page completely loads notice all the "Cross-Context Leakage" . This is because cookies from grctech.com and grc.com are allowed in both a first and third-party context. Take Care, Will Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Disable "Accept third-party cookies" privacy option. 2. Set two "allow for session" cookie exceptions for grc.com and grctech.com . 3. Test for cookie leakage on http://www.grc.com/cookies/context.htm . 4. As you can see exception cookies are allowed in a third-party context. Actual Results: Cookie Exceptions take precedence over the "Accept third-party cookies" privacy cookies option. That is, all cookies that belong to an exception are allowed in both a first and third-party context. Expected Results: Cookie Exceptions respect the "Accept third-party cookies" privacy cookies option. If third-party cookies are allowed then cookie exceptions allow cookies in both a first and third-party context. If third-party cookies are not allowed then cookie exceptions only allow cookies in a first-party context.

      <title>RSS feed stories appearing in search results for All Bookmarks</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0 This problem may actually be an intentional "feature" of the Library, but I think it is not what the user expects, and is not particularly useful. Searching on "bookmarks" (in Library or Sidebar) should only return bookmarks that the user actually added. Instead, if I enter a search term, I may get a very long list of results, 99% of which are from RSS and not what I am looking for. Perhaps there should be a separate search category for RSS stories in addition to "Selected Folder" "All Bookmarks" and "History". In this case, my 9 RSS feeds are in a folder on my bookmarks toolbar. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open the Library to "All Bookmarks". 2. Type "rss" in the search box. Actual Results: A long list of items from your RSS feeds appears in the results, in addition to valid any bookmarks hits. Expected Results: It should filter out items from RSS feeds.</description>

      <title>No easy way to return focus to content area from location bar or search bar</title>

The only way I can think of is to hit control-shift-F6, but even this is not ideal, since it won't return focus to the exact place you had originally (e.g., if you were in the middle of editing a text box). My suggestion is to have "Esc" return the focus, and perhaps have a dedicated keyboard shortcut as well. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Browse to http://www.google.com 2. Type a few letters into the input box on the page 3. Hit control-L 4. Hit "Esc" 5. Hit control-shift-F6 6. Type a few more letters Actual Results: After step 4, nothing happens. After step 5, a dotted line appears around the entire tab pane. After step 6, Quick Find bar pops up, and new text is not added to input box on the page. Expected Results: After step 4 (and step 5), focus should return to the input box on the page. After step 6, new letters typed should be appended to the text already in the input box.</description>

      <title>Enhancement Request: More easier way to enable/disable proxy</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0 Can we have a more easier way to enable/disable proxy in Mozilla? This will ease a lot of users pain who use the same system at home (direct connection to internet) and office network(with proxy). Maxthon has recently introduces a menu item "Tools"-&gt;"Proxy" where we can select the proxy or disable proxy. This looks lot easier than having to open Tools-&gt;Options-&gt;Advanced-&gt;Network-&gt;Settings-&gt;"Connection Setting" dialog on Mozilla.

      <title>Smart Location Bar (AwesomeBar) Programmable Options</title>

Others like it and others don't. Personally, I like it in conjunction to Bookmarks Tag but it seems not to default to listing Tags but to History and we know that a lot of URLs in History are surf-bys or irrelevant searches. I suggest options to have the AwesomeBar drop-down listing prioritize according to user preference (e.g. Tags first, History first, List from external directory first., etc.) Similarly there should also be a UI under options to turn the AwesomeBar on or off. Thanks. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

So it would be very nice if firefox would allow to assign external application (like nautilus) for smb and other supported protocols. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.Enter any smb address in address field (like smb://192.168.1.1/) 2.Press "Enter". 3. Actual Results: Firefox 3.0 shows blank page without any reaction. Expected Results: Should show samba shares or give message about not supported protocol or (better) launch external application (must be assigned by user) to view smb.</description>

      <title>[Mac] The DMG Window's Instructions Could Be Clearer Regarding Moving the Firefox Program to the Application Folder</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.4; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008061004 Firefox/3.0 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.4; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008061004 Firefox/3.0 The installer window for a Mac (on Firefox 3) could be done in a clearer manner. Right now, when you open the disk image, you're presented with a picture of a Firefox icon and an arrow indicating that it should be dragged to the Applications folder. This could be clearer, particularly by including explanatory text. See: &lt;http://www.macworld.com/article/134067/2008/06/firefox3_install.html&gt; I also think that the way the installer runs now, someone will be tempted to run it directly off the disk image. I downloaded the latest build of Firefox, which is today's build, as of 9 July 2008 at 3:26 a.m. PDT. This didn't have the same installer interface, but since I wasn't able to find anything on Bugzilla saying it had been changed, I presume it has not been changed. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Double-click on a disk image for Firefox for Macintosh. Actual Results: The window appears, with the icon layout discussed above.</description>

      <title>Mozilla should distribute a "Free core fonts" set as part of the Firefox distribution</title>
      <description>What happens now: * If a web page specifies the use of a high-quality Free font such as DejaVu, SIL Gentium or Computer Modern within a web page, very few browsers will be able to display it as intended. What should happen: * All Firefox users (and eventually all or almost all users of other browsers, see below) should be able to see the text displayed in the correct font I suggest that Mozilla should make a set of these already-existing high-quality available as part of the Firefox distribution, either by packaging them with the browser, distributing them via software update or install-on-demand download, or by making them available via extensions. Advantages: This would greatly increase the number of high-quality fonts available for use on the Web, for Firefox users on all operating systems. Since Firefox's market share is now greater than 20% worldwide and rapidly growing, this should be sufficient to create a network effect in favour of the use of these fonts (which will be completely backwards compatible: see below). Their presence on large numbers of web pages will encourage other browser and operating system vendors to package these fonts as part of their distributions. In particular, this will be useful for users of languages written in non-Roman scripts which are not widely supported by native fonts in most computer operating systems. Examples of non-Roman fonts include Georgian, Amharic, Burmese, Tibetan, Malayalam, Sinhalese, Cree, Inuktitut and Cherokee. This will also be useful for users of languages written in Roman scripts, such as Vietnamese, which use unusual characters or diacritic combinations which are not widely supported in mainstream fonts. Finally, the availability of Free mathematics fonts for Firefox will greatly help the adoption of MathML. Disadvantages: None. Because of the pre-existing provisions for fallback in HTML/CSS font specifications, and the continuing market dominance of Internet Explorer, web page designers will continue to use font fallbacks appropriately, and the use of these fonts should not disadvantage the users of any other browser or operating system.</description>

      <title>Package a FIPS certified build of NSS with Firefox 3</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; InfoPath.2; MS-RTC LM 8) Build Identifier: 3.12 Current builds of NSS use softtoken3 version 3.12.0, but the last FIPS-certified version is 3.11.4. A custom build of Firefox using NSS 3.12 linked with libsofttoken3 3.11.4 is available on RHEL and Fedora, but is not generally available for other platforms. This issue limits NSS use in the US Federal governement, which must have FIPS 140-2 compliance. A compatibility mode which specially loads the FIPS-compliant module(s) when checked would be ideal.

      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008061004 Firefox/3.0 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008061004 Firefox/3.0 If you have an empty sidebar and try to drag a new bookmark, you cannot. You have to have an element in "Unsorted Bookmarks" first, then you can drag into it. It's probably not a big deal but I thought I'd point it out. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Clean install of FF3, no bookmarks. 2. Open the Bookmarks sidebar 3. Try to drag a bookmark into it. (Workaround: add a bookmark to unsorted with apple+D, then you can). Actual Results: A little icon that indicates you can't do it. Expected Results: A bookmark in the sidebar. Thanks for an overall really great browser.</description>

      <title>Internet Explorer faster than Firefox 3 in Windows Vista</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008051206 Firefox/3.0 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008051206 Firefox/3.0 Loaded up Vista, browsed sites with built in IE. Noticed much faster than FF3. So a general improvement needs to be made by Firefox folks, on SPEED optimizations. I know the variables - cache size, Operating system used (my FF is on XP), add-ons in FF slowing down operations etc. But noticed even with multiple tabs opened in IE, it was faster in page rendition than FF3. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.start windows Vista 2.open IE 3.browse to a site 4.Open Firefox, browse to same site, notice speed. Maybe less noticeable on very fast computers/hard drives. On my 1.3Ghz its noticeable. Flush cache, turn off plug-ins. General speed improvements in Firefox would be appreciated. Code Optimization specialists needed to be consulted.</description>

It tends to be confusing that in Linux "Preferences" is in the Edit menu but in Windows "Options" is in the Tools menu. Wouldn't it be easier to put the menus in the same place in all operating systems? Or, if this is an attempt to normalize the windows to those more common in the operating systems, could the Preferences/Options be placed in BOTH the Edit and Tools menus in both operating systems so they would be easier to find? Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open Firefox in Linux 2. "Preferences" is in the Edit menu, not the Tools menu 3. Open Firefox in Windows 4. "Options" is in the Tools menu, not the Edit menu It would be nice if the menus were consistent. The rest of the items are in the same spot.</description>

I mean the Window, where i can see if a cookie is excepted for a domain). At the moment it is very difficult to find out if a Subdomain is blocked. For example there are some Sites routing their login for a second over a Subdomain like asdf.domain.com and if you blocked one time it is very difficult to find all possible subdomains in the current view. Ebay is also a good Example, there are so many subdomains inside my list I could never find out if i blocked one in past because it seemed unimportant. (I'm always missing a "temporary block" for new sites.) I Would prefer a System like Domain.com -&gt; subdomain.com domain.com -www.domain.com -sub.domain.com So it would be easy to find the right domain. A search-function like in the "accepted Cookie"-Window would be also nice. Hope you will think about. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

Perhaps someone can change it to the right one. It would be nice if there is a symbol for cookie-status in the status-bar. For example next to the lock for SSL. Sometimes it would be very helpful to see if cookies are blocked or allowed an to change this fast. Example: You visit a new site and then you got notifications for x cookies. Normally you would block them first. If you decide to register later or cookies are needed for site functionality you have to look first if the site is blocked and then change it. With a Symbol it would be faster an much more easy. Hope you will think about this. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

Firefox does not provide any mechanism for 3-rd party applications residing on the same PC as Firefox for accessing the cookies stored by latter. Such a mechanism can be valuable to many applications trying to streamline their deployment flow from a web-page. It is possible to access Internet Explorer cookies through WinAPI on contrary, making the latter. If there existed applications that manually parsed the cookies.txt cookie store of the Firefox 2.0 and earlier, than all these applications got broken due to inability to parse the cookies.sqlite of FF 3. A unified mechanism for cookie access would allow for applications being forward-compatible with future versions of Firefox. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

I've concluded that the 'ctrl' button could mean something without causing any trouble, and in any cases when the 'ctrl' is down, the browsing area is not important anymore. navgraph: The idea is to show a spring-system based simulation about the pages that are open - the parental links should be the pages where they are opened from -&gt; this way, every time i hit control i could get an 'overview' of my browsing, and closing could done by doing a recursive close on a subtree. Node's should labeled using the page's icon, and the title of the page, or the request which was entered into the titlebar (i start searches using 'g querystring') Current page history functionality could be moved here to, because going back on a page, is just another 'dimension', the timeline of the tab. This could be an alternate to the 'tabs' at the top, and this way the user can have more control on his/her browsing session i think this could be very useful Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3. i think that i could create this feature as some kind of extension, but i'm not really familiar with the architecture of firefox - and i think that this should be built-in.</description>

This is very good visible on very slow Internet connection (e.g. old 33600 analog modem connection to net) and many FF tabs/windows open. The most recently opened pages will time-out because the network connection bandwidth is filled up with content downloaded by previously opened pages. The smart option for FF is to smart download pages one by one by caching clicked links in memory and opening them only when previous page will end downloading and release net bandwidth. This way pages which are available and working will not time-out just because net connection is congested with download of previously clicked web pages. Reproducible: Sometimes Steps to Reproduce: 1. Connect to the Internet using very slow connection. 2. Open many,many,many web pages (in tabs or windows). 3. Keep watching like first pages keep being downloaded and those later opened after some time return time-out instead of content. If you are lucky the last pages which timed out may be partially downloaded and will allow you click 'Refresh' to reload them. If there was long data starvation time there will be no possibility to click 'Refresh' because web page timed out before it began to download. Actual Results: Opening many web pages on slow connection will time-out the last opened. Expected Results: firefox should manage webpages download by making webpage download queue. Thanks to webpage download queue I can read these first downloaded and be sure the rest will not time out.</description>

In firefox 2.0, when yoy typed in part of a url, the only suggestions would be addresses that started with the text you had entered. When you entered "sh" in the address bar, the sites in the location bar dropdown would include (for my history at least) "shortpacked.com", "shortpacked.livejournal.com" and their various pages, with the root level sites at the top of the list. FF3's broken smart location bar for the same text gives me addresses like cgi.ebay.com, bugzilla.mozilla.com, rs.4chan.org, transformers.wikia.com, egscomics.com and a whole lot of other sites I don't want. If I wanted to visit those, I would have typed "cgi", "bug", "rs", "tran" or "egs". Also, showing the page title is nice, but there should be a way to disable it and just show the url Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.type in part of web address in location bar (ex, "go") Actual Results: results include a bunch of urls that do not start with "go" Expected Results: only urls that begin with "go" are shown</description>

      <title>HTTP Auth prompts and Javascript alerts should open in background</title>
      <description>Visiting a site that requires HTTP Authentication and then switching to another tab results in focus returning to the original tab prompting for a username and password. The tab requiring auth may not be the active tab (eg: I option-click on a link that leads to a site requiring auth); from a user-experience perspective this can be extremely annoying (eg: I was typing something in my active tab when the active tab suddenly switched). The same goes for Javascript alerts. In Safari, the active tab is not switched, but instead an alert icon is displayed against the tab. The auth dialog / alert is displayed only when the user manually switches to that tab (See Attachment). Much better UX in my opinion :) Sorry if this is a dupe.</description>

So what I'm suggesting is the addition of a settings to only not ask you on clearing private data on exit. So when you clear from inside firefox you still get asked as to what clear. This will also require another modification as to what settings it will use when clearing on exit as with the current design it will use the setting you have used from the browser which might lead a user forgetting to change it after cleaning to what he wants it to clear on exit.

This is unusable, as you can't see where you are dropping the image, you have to "guess" what you're doing. The resized image that is shown while dragging is way too big, an image 3 times smaller whould be more than enough. But more important is to always let the user see where the pointer is. If you hold the image from a corner you almost can see where the cursor is dropping, but if you start dragging from the center, the dragging image is drawn centered in the cursor, and you can't see anything. The same happens for example with tabs: it's difficult to thow a tab to the "bookmarks" menu entry, as the tab drawing you are dragging doesn't let you see anything. Amarok solves this problem perfectly when dragging albums to the playlist, see screenshot attached (sorry about the quality, but taking a screenshot removed the cursor). Ksnapshot also does it exactly the way I think it should be. Reproducible: Always</description>

That didn't do what I wanted, so I wanted to remove it. There's no way from the UI to do this. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: Simple way: 1. Click Tools &gt; Options &gt; Advanced 2. Try to delete one of those content types. More realistic way: 1. Go to some page that offers files with a mime type you've never encountered before. In my case, http://www.djvu.org/docs/ 2. Click a file 3. In the "Opening ...." dialog, choose Open with (I chose Notepad) and check "Do this automatically..." 4. (File of the novel file type opens.) 5. Now choose Tools &gt; Options &gt; Advanced. 6. Try to delete the new content type. Actual Results: You can't delete the content type association. Expected Results: There has to be some way to remove a content type association. If I click Application details in the drop down and click Remove, it goes back to "Always ask". The UI could either be like about:config, where if you reset an option, it vanishes, or it could be explicit "Reset to default" which warns "This content type is not one of the defaults that came with Firefox, so if you reset to default it will be deleted (but you can set it up again later). Presumably there's a workaround by editing a file somewhere. The [Help] button didn't help.</description>

But I don't think they are completely un-useful and are desirable in certain situations. For example, "Bug 450437 – duplicate URLs dropped when bookmarking all tabs" (sorry, not sure how to insert a link here). There are ways to still create duplicates intentionally, via dragging or copy&amp;paste, but Fx3 is not very accommodating to them. Here are some request/problems/observations: 1. Request: Re-allow adding bms via Ctrl-D or Star button. Thankfully, someone has already written an extension to do this: http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?f=48&amp;t=795945 2. Problem: Removing a bm (using the star dialog) will REMOVE ALL duplicates too (careful), even if other fields (title, tags, keywords, description) differ. 3. Minor: The awesome bar will NOT match on a bm's "Name" (Title) if its url exists in a more recent bm. So if you are wondering why you are not getting a match, you probably have a duplicate, with a different title, that is more recent. 4. Minor: The star button will always pick the last modified copy of the bm to edit. Since I think they should be treated uniquely, it should somehow let you choose among the matching candidates.

      <title>remove "awsome bar" code to an add-on / extension</title>
      <description>I believe that the url bar / location bar implementation in the browser itself should be as small and simple as possible. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle Any extra functionality (drop down lists, displaying page titles, displaying page icons, searching / autocomplete) belongs in an optional add-on / extension.</description>

So i use it to find stored links to paste them into a forum. Because i can not copy from the drop down i have to load the page, copy the address from the address bar and click back to paste it. If it is possible to copy directly from the drop down that would be much easier. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: Type some text in the address bar you know it reveals a bookmark. Actual Results: You can not copy from the drop down. Expected Results: You can copy an address from the dropdown without loading the page.</description>

I guess most people are irritated that the UI has already disappeared while the database is still shutting down. And restarting firefox during database shutdown can lead to data loss (session store overwritten). A UI like "Firefox is shutting down. Please wait." may be a short term solution until the database is getting faster. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

      <title>scroll position changes when window is resized on long pages</title>

I know that this is because the width of the window changes, which modifies the formatting, so that "1000 pixels from the top" or "30% from the top" (whichever it is) refers to a different position than the one I was reading. But it seems easy enough to add an internal pointer to the content at the top-left of the page, and after resizing, scroll to that position. It could become an option in the preferences (it might already be an option in about:config that I don't know about). Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: The twiki page referenced above provides a good illustration, though any long webpage would show the effect. 1. Click to a sub-topic somewhere mid-way down the table of contents. 2. Change the width of the window by a factor of 2. 3. Note that you're in some different section, and it's difficult to find your place again. Since you clicked to it through the table of contents (an &lt;a name&gt; link), you can find your place again by putting the cursor in the address bar and typing Enter. But if you found what you wanted by scrolling, and then resized the window (e.g. to copy-paste it into another window), you'd have to find it all over again manually. This is a problem for productivity (when you have to do this sort of thing all day). Actual Results: Lost scroll position, lost time, lost concentration... Expected Results: The browser window should keep the top-leftmost character/image/object in the top-left when the window size changes. Everything else should scroll and resize accordingly. For years now, I've been expecting someone else to report this as a bug or feature request. Since it's not present in version 3, I thought I would ask for it personally.</description>

      <title>Suggestion: Change save on exit to an "undo" based model.</title>

If you say "Yes", then the next time you open Firefox, your session will be restored. While this is handy (and much appreciated!) the "undo" method is preferable because it prevents irreversible mistakes (such as saying "No, I don't need this session" - then realising that you do!). Instead of asking on exit, just save the session automatically. Then, when Firefox opens, ask the user if they want it restored (or optionally, bookmarked). Optionally, it would be nice at this point to have a preview of what was in the session and be able to select some or all pages to open. Firefox can then hang onto the session until the user exits again so that, if they realise midway through browsing that they DID want that session, they can still call it up.

These eat up valuable space that might otherwise be used for displaying the actual URL content, and having these getting in the way all the time when I don't need them is a too high price to pay for the convenience of getting slightly quicker access to the functionality when I do need it. After all, most of the time while browsing you will NOT be bookmarking the page you're at. Similarly, I don't want the "Search" icon inside the search field, as I'm quite happy hitting "Enter" in order to activate the search functionality - and would prefer seeing some extra letters of the search string to having a "convenient" button in the field. So, a option to hide these icons would be nice - although the functionality might really be removed completely for all I care. Reproducible: Always</description>

      <title>hide the magnifying glass until you start typing</title>
      <description>When reading bug 453026, it hit me : why don't we hide the magnifying glass icon by default, and start to show it when someone starts to type. Just like what happens in the location field (the green go button). I keep this separate from bug 453026, because it's partially the opposite : if you have content in the search field, the field will become smaller. That's the opposite from what Toralf wants, although it uses less icons when you first start up. It's also a prompt to clear your search field after the search is done (which is a tick of me), if you don't want to show that info to everyone who looks over your shoulder. Note: I don't care for the magnifying glass or the go button myself, but I think that the behavior should be consistent : either show the button at all times, or don't show it all all, or show it only when you start typing.</description>

      <description>It should be possible to play videos in a full-screen mode. Every stand-alone media player supports this, and most Flash-based players do too. The HTML5 spec warns against allowing content to invoke full-screen mode (security), but there should be a way for the browser chrome to invoke it.

It is not uncommon for online forum software packages (e.g, phpBB2), upon a user posting a new topic or reply in that forum, to display a confirmation message about the post being made successfully, with a meta-redirect back to the topic or forum in which they posted their message. Allowing Firefox to implicitly allow these kinds of meta-redirects (i.e. ones with a relative URI and/or within the same domain as the originating page) while still explicitly blocking/warning about other http-redirects in general would be a welcome addition.

      <title>"Larry" should link to Certificate manager for exception sites.</title>
      <description>We allow users to make exceptions for certs we cannot validate due to unknown issuer, mismatched name, or because they are expired. The SSL error page will open the exception dialog for the user, so the user has no way to figure out how to get back to that dialog if they want to revoke the exception. The Site Information panel ("Larry") does tell people when a cert is valid because they've made an exception rather than "Verified by FooCA". It would help if that text ("You have added a security exception for this site") were made a link that opened up the Servers pane of the Certificate Manager. Should definitely get this into 3.1, but if it's just a new link and no new text without any complicated code it'd be nice to back-port to 3.0.x too.</description>

Reproducible: Always I realise that the shape of the buttons and also the location items are already subjects that are being discussed a lot, but I couldn't find anything about this in Bugzilla - which I thing should have RFEs for all features people want changed.</description>

      <title>Make tab previews bigger and show a smaller part of each tab</title>
      <description>Created attachment 336764 [details] [diff] [review] patch We currently capture full pages and shrink them to the desired preview size. In most cases it's probably better to capture a smaller part, which in return wouldn't have to be shrunken as much. See also bug 445458.</description>

      <title>Middle-clicking "Live Bookmark Feed Failed to Load" should load feed homepage in new tab</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.9.0.1) Gecko/2008070208 Firefox/3.0.1 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.9.0.1) Gecko/2008070208 Firefox/3.0.1 My connection has been intermittent lately, so one of my Live Bookmark Feeds didn't load: that is, I was shown a "fake link" in the Feed's menu telling me as much. "Live Bookmark feed failed to load". Clicking this fake link gives me an unhelpful dialog box, instead of doing anything useful. Middle clicking the fake link gives me the same dialog box, and additionally opens a tab to a strange url. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Stymie a Live Feed's attempt to reload. 2. Click on "Live Bookmark feed failed to load". OR 2. Middle-click on "Live Bookmark feed failed to load". Actual Results: When left-clicking the fake link, a dialog box would appear: "Alert: The URL is not valid and cannot be loaded." When middle-clicking, the dialog box appears as before, in addition to a new tab, URI being "about:livemark-failed". Expected Results: Optimal result: When left clicking: the feed should be refreshed. When middle-clicking: the feed's homepage should be opened in another tab/window. Passable result: When clicking, the dialog box isn't entirely insipid. * The Feed is on my Bookmark Toolbar. I have not tried to reproduce the bug from any feeds in the Bookmarks menu. * The Feed in question is Atom, http://feeds.feedburner.com/LinuxHatersBlog Screenshots, for redundancy: http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v622/scott_karana/Firefox/livebookmark1.png http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v622/scott_karana/Firefox/livebookmark2.png These are related bugs: 278247, 318216, 417085, and 410632.</description>

Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Go to any page that has an SVG embedded in it. 2. Choose Tools &gt; Page Info &gt; Media 3. Select the SVG from the list of addresses. Actual Results: "Media Preview" shows nothing or a broken image. "Dimensions" shows 0px x 0px. Expected Results: "Media Preview" should render the SVG. I think some SVGs have a nominal size, otherwise just size to fit the preview window. Bug 448630 is to get &lt;audio&gt; and &lt;video&gt; preview in Page Info, maybe alterations to Page Info's Media Preview that it needs will help this. I can't believe no one else has reported this bug, but searching bugzilla for SVG media, preview, page info, etc. found nothing.</description>

I filed it under security because it relates more to security than general browser usage. It seems to me that cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgeries (XSRF) would be severely limited if this architecture change is implemented. The change is this: Each new window launched from the file menu (including the associated shortcut key) or from a new command line launch would each have its own sandbox and its own set of session cookies. New tabs, and new windows launched from current pages (clicks) would share the sandbox and session cookies. This architecture change is not trivial, it would affect the Session Restore module, and would have to be tested thoroughly with many different sites that use DOM Scripting. Google Chrome has done this with every window and every tab. They seem to be assuming that DOM scripted web pages do not open different windows, or that users like myself don't open new windows or new tabs on the same site to do comparisons (think bank account details, vs. scheduled transfers details). However, maybe you can leverage some of their open-source code for most of the work done here. Internet Explorer 7 has this feature, but only for new command line launches. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

I think it would be better if the tab was opened just after (on the right) of the current one. The current bahavior can be very annoying if one has a lot of opened tabs because it forces one to scroll right until one reaches the new tab. Note that IE7 already made this improvement. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open severals tabs 2. Give the focus to any tab except the last one 3.

      <title>Make Ctrl+Tab an optional feature</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1b1pre) Gecko/20080907032646 Minefield/3.1b1pre (.NET CLR 3.5.30729) Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1b1pre) Gecko/20080907032646 Minefield/3.1b1pre (.NET CLR 3.5.30729) Note: I put this on the 'feedback' area before I realized that it probably wasn't going to be looked at seriously, and so I offer my apologizes in advance for this double post. ----- I want to like this feature, I really do...but it's a usability nightmare in almost every respect. I'm referring to, specifically, the "preview" and new ctrl-tabbing behavior. This behavior has all the elements of a "win" - nice animation, previews, and memory in the tabbing. However, all of these features are simply less powerful than their previous counterparts, less helpful, and unintuitive. For example, one default behavior that browser users have is to open up several tabs, and then go through them in order. Usually, this is done with Alt+Tab: one alt+tab goes to the first article clicked, another to the second, and so on. Now, the default behavior is on a single ALT+Tab is to go to the tab opened *before* the current tab. "I've already been there! I'm done with that tab for now! I want to see the one I just opened!" the user screams! After a few seconds of frustration, they think "Oh well, I"ll just keep alt+tabbing, looking for the article I want." But now, the user is presented with not ten tabs they can see, but three. The trade off (and supposed benefit) is that you get to see three previews of those windows. Unfortunately, the small size and lack of detail makes this trade off a failure. Before, a user could open ten news stories that they were interested in, and know exactly what it took to get to each of them. Now, instead of seeing the first half of each of those 10 stories in their browser, they now see most of the title of one of them, and three images. These images are small and lack detail. To add further insult to injury, the animation used actually *increases* the time it takes for the window I want to look at to be "previewable", since it ends up having to move the small blurry image for a second or two before I can focus on it and decide whether or not this group of blurry squiggly lines was the article I wanted to look at or not. The preview, by itself, might be useful if it took a long time to display a new tab; after all, summarizing and presenting information fast is the main benefit of previews. Unfortunately, this new tab implementation also fails in that regard: changing tabs before was almost instantaneous. The full window itself was an excellent 'preview' tool. Didn't like it? Wrong one? Another button press and you were on another window. It used to take mere milliseconds for the display to change, but now users have to wait for the animation to complete, and some extra time for their brain to decide if the fuzzy preview image is actually what they wanted to see. Now, you can only view one new tab in the time it took to see four or five before. The preview behavior might be acceptable if it increased the chance of finding the right page, but it doesn't. Instead, it makes Alt+Tab no longer a linear movement tool. Since "Alt+Tab" no longer goes to the next tab, but the /last tab you were looking at/, trying to get to the next tab becomes an exercise in frustration. "Okay, how many tabs ago did I look at that one?" as the user slowly moves through tabs, straining their eyes looking at the blurry picture and carefully reading the title of each one. They may do this, or they may simply give up and click on the one they want to go to, and dispense of the whole keyboard shortcut convenience. I've seen this compared to the 'windows' alt+tab behavior, like in 445476. However, there are several very important differences. The windows alt+tab behavior is instant: it brings up the new windows and allows you to switch between them as fast as you can press alt+tab. You can see every single window, and see them right away. In addition, starting with Vista, they don't even keep the order past a few; after the first few "last visited" windows, they put them in alphabetical order, so you can more quickly find the window you wanted. This feature has the classic "Developer" behavior with tabs, when wanting to go back and forth between a few code files is desirable. The animations, the reflectiveness on the bottom of the window, the smooth transitions are all quite nice, but they detract from the simplicity of the previous system, the one that people know and can use effectively. If it had been the default behavior since day one, it might not have been a problem. The fact is, the layman will not understand why he's suddenly unable to press "ctrl+tab" to see the cute picture of kittens he just opened. Making this non-standard behavior the default will alienate the majority of users who just want to get to the next tab in their browser, and it will be a thorn that could slow Firefox's adoption. Reproducible: Always Expected Results: Make this an additional behavior, available for "power users" to turn on. Make it an option, for sure, but not the default option. Every other browser on the market gives ctrl+tab preference to "next tab".</description>

Luckily I put in some code to avoid duplicate entries. I then noticed that when I typed in the URL of my script in the address bar, the little icon on the left side of the address bar did a little animation when I finished typing... I am assuming this is a auto preload feature of the browser.. can you please either turn this off or at the very least give me an option to turn it off? This little feature of yours may cause problems for programmers like me in the future and if someone was unlucky enough not to notice this and did not put in some sort of protection code or backed up their data they may end up with something like an empty database without ever knowing why. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. type in URL 2. little icon on left does animation 3. my script was 'run' without me even running it Actual Results: my script at URL loads before I want to Expected Results: URL stays there without 'preloading'</description>

I don't know about others, but I've often found myself middle clicking the "Display this frame only" for nothing, and only just noticed the option to open the frame in a new tab today. I propose we merge all these options to make things more simple, cleaner, and more consistent (albeit less discoverable for new users, I guess, but these users probably don't care about this option... I guess it's mostly for power users and web devs). We'd only keep "Display this frame only", but middle clicking or Ctrl+clicking it would open it in a new tab, and shift+clicking it would open it in a new window. Reproducible: Always</description>

      <title>Combat scareware with heuristics to detect fraudulent JavaScript popups/dialogs</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.0.1) Gecko/2008072820 Firefox/3.0.1 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.0.1) Gecko/2008072820 Firefox/3.0.1 I know most security conscious people browse with JavaScript turned off or with NoScript/FlashBlock etc., but I know several people who have fallen for this scam, on IE and on Firefox. The problem is as such: * User is visiting site. * Popup: 'Your computer is infected with a virus, click OK to install SuperDuperCoolAntivirus 2009'. Some users click Cancel but this still leads to a download page. And a 'your computer is infected web page' What I am suggesting is on alerts which match a database of potentially fishy terms, add an info bar (or whatever they are called, the yellow/grey bar that drops down from the top of the browser and provides a message) alerting the user that 'This alert may be a scam, and may download a virus if OK or Cancel is clicked. Click [ Abort ] to stop the script running this alert and any potential download. ' - and have an Abort button which stops all scripts from running, or prevents at least all scripts from the domain the script originated from running. Would this be plausible? I don't know. It might reduce these drive-by downloads. Of course it would require proper implementation and a good database, and perhaps the scammers/virus writers would eventually make errors in the spelling to throw off the filter, but, we could try our best to stop the majority of these downloads from getting through. We would need to keep a database of URLs as well. Reproducible: Always</description>

      <title>Improve truncation and RTL display of EV cert owner strings in location bar</title>
      <description>Created attachment 338667 [details] [diff] [review] patch v1 From bug 429722 comment 18: &gt; &gt; As proposed in bug 414114 already, wouldn't it make more sense to truncate the &gt; &gt; end of the organization name instead? I'm attaching an illustration which shows &gt; &gt; middle truncation on the left hand side and the proposed solution on the right &gt; &gt; hand side. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Will provide a patch (in a separate bug) if anybody is interested. &gt; &gt; Yeah, I do think it's a separate bug, but a good idea, so as Dao says, please &gt; feel invited to do so. So here's a first try - let me know what you think. For OS X, I've also adjusted the top padding, so that the EV organization name is now baseline aligned with the URL string (currently, it's shifted by 2px).</description>

You know the drill: You get a window saying that there is an update, and it prompts you to install it. You accept, it download the update, install it and the it says "Installation successful" and a shiny "Continue" button waits to be pressed. I think the default behavior should be that firefox only notifies the user and waits for interaction if a error occurs. Any other case should continue. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.Start firefox 2.If there is an update you get a dialog, you choose to update. Actual Results: When it its successfully updated a continue button waits to be pressed. Expected Results: If the update goes ok, firefox should continue without waiting. If the update goes wrong, firefox should notify the user.</description>

      <title>Ability to see source of tab (The Final Back Button)</title>
      <description>Some people open webpages from IRC and Mail and Twitter clients and the like. Ever have a tab and you're like, "How did I get here?" Well, it'd be nice if Firefox kept a "What tab/url spawned this tab?" for things like that, especially popups. As well, if you could find out what app sent a data packet to Firefox to open a page (I think this might be possible on OS X, not sure about other systems), that would be way cool.</description>

      <title>Descriptive tooltips for browser UI</title>
      <description>One of the most common issues we see in support are people who are unfamiliar with the UI of new features like the unified back/forward button, the add bookmark dialog and the location bar. One way we can address this simply is to have a second tooltip that explains how to use a feature on mouseover if you hold it there for a second longer. Eg: hover over the location bar, you get the URL as you do now, wait an extra 2 seconds, get the following tooltip: Smart Location Bar, type URLs to webpages here or start typing to instantly search your browsing history and bookmarks. The same extended description for other aspects of the UI: Eg: The "bookmark menu" folder in all dialogs should tooltip to: "Holds bookmarks and folders listed when you click Bookmarks in your menu bar", even things like the [+] should tooltip to "expand this folder" (You'd be surprised how many people are confused by this since there's now an extra layer of folders). The favicon could have the following tooltip: "Favicon, drag to a bookmark folder or toolbar to bookmark this page, click to see security information for this page" I'd even like it for menu items to explain things like "add-ons". A side benefit is that people will learn the names of the various aspects of the browser UI so if the DO search for help, they'll have something to search on. (Of course, it'd be nice if this feature could be disabled but I think it's unobtrusive enough to not need it.) Alternately, have a [help] button like they have in Microsoft office which turns your cursor to a questionmark cursor and you click on an aspect of the UI to get a help article. I don't like this option as much as it's not as discoverable but it may be easier on localizers since the strings are all stored on the KB.</description>

      <title>close-last-tab should show about:blank before closing window</title>
      <description>Bug 392870 altered the behavior of closing the last tab in a window. The window now closes when you close the last tab in a window. Half baked idea: When closing the last tab, only close the window if the tab was about:blank. If it was not about:blank, closing the tab should change the tab location to about:blank (and, thus, closing the tab again would close the window). Eg: site.com --&gt; about:blank --&gt; window closes. My ingrained task is to use Command-W (or clicking the tab close icon) as a way to indicate I'm done with the current tab... The next tab is then displayed, or if it was the last tab it was (previously) simply cleared with a blank page. Now it feels surprising to sometimes have the window close when I do this. Transitioning through about:blank would be a way to retain this use case, while still allowing close-last-tab to close the window when it makes sense to.</description>

      <title>Improve secure URL Bar visual style possibilities by adding an attribute to the EV Toplevel state</title>

Firefox 3.0 removed it. Users still expecting changes on the autocomplete-textbox-container background when they are at a secure URL and indeed the other browsers use this kind of indication. This bug is dependent from Bug 456761 since Bug 448939 has removed the "level" attribute. I've already wrote an extension which does what I'm proposing here: http://www.silvermel.net/dev/colorsecureurl_0.0.1a2pre.xpi but I don't think an extension should be needed.

      <title>Provide a way to open a link into private browsing mode</title>
      <description>Along with creating a private browsing mode, I think there should be a way to open a link into private browsing mode. That way a user won't have to copy the link, go into private browsing mode and then paste the link. Unless I'm not understanding how private browsing mode is going to work. Is it going to work like enter private browsing mode deletes all current cache but current tabs are still display (would this cause icons/pictures to be reloaded?) and then any subsequent browsing is not cached?</description>

      <title>The option to open the new link in a new tab is removed in FF3 which could be restored</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.2) Gecko/2008091620 Firefox/3.0.2 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.2) Gecko/2008091620 Firefox/3.0.2 The option to open the new link in a new tab is removed in FF3 which could be restored. As can be seen from the link provided, many people still want this feature. We don't need to provide a GUI option for this but at least in the about:config list. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open a website. 2. Enter a new address and hit enter. 3. The website replaces the existing page rather than open a new tab. Actual Results: The website replaces the existing page. Expected Results: A new tab should be opened for the new link if the setting is done. This was removed as per this bug -- https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=308862 Please put this back.</description>

      <title>Options-&gt;Advanced-&gt;Encryptation-&gt;Revocation Lists can open multiple crlManager.xul windows</title>
      <description>Created attachment 340313 [details] [diff] [review] Fix window type in showCRLs() Steps to reproduce: 1. Options-&gt;Advanced-&gt;Encryption 2. Click on the [Revocation Lists] button. 3. Click on the [Revocation Lists] button again. 4. Click on the [Revocation Lists] button and again. Actual Results: Multiple [Manage CRLs] windows open. Expected Results: Once one window is opened, additional clicks should just focus on the existing window. &lt;http://mxr.mozilla.org/comm-central/source/mozilla/browser/components/preferences/advanced.js#518&gt; showCRLs: function () { document.documentElement.openWindow("Mozilla:CRLManager", "chrome://pippki/content/crlManager.xul", "", null); }, Reason: crlManager.xul never had a window type until I fixed it in Bug 445015 (see http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/8fcf92cfd811). For consistency with the rest of pippki I used an all lower cased window type. This patch makes Firefox use the right window type. Note this never worked ,so technically this isn't a regression.</description>

It would: a) Make target=_blank links open in a new window b) Make links opened from an other app open in a new window c) Hide the tab bar d) Remove File&gt;New tab e) Remove Context-Menu-on-link&gt;Open in new tab ...perhaps there's more Reproducible: Always This should depend on bug #457092</description>

'Open with' doesn't give any indication as to which (or even if any) app has been chosen previously. This is a constant source of frustration. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Click on a non-html link 2. 3. Actual Results: Radiobutton 'Open with' and button 'Browse...' appears - no indication if any app has been configged. Expected Results: I would suggest the name of the application configured previously (eg. to the right of the Browse button) and '&lt;not selected yet&gt;' or similar message in that case.</description>

However, when using full-screen mode, ctrl-L opens up a different dialog. This dialog does search through the history/bookmarks as the awesome bar but shows the results differently, without the site title and highlighting of the searched terms. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. When not in full-screen mode, press ctrl-L 2. Enter some search terms. 3. When in full-screen, press ctrl-L 4. Enter some search terms. Actual Results: In the regular mode, the bar showed the results nicely with site titles and highlighting. In the full-screen mode, the combo-box showed only the urls, without titles or highlighting. Expected Results: The full screen mode should open a bar similar to the one when not full screened. Possibly, one that is docked to the top of the screen instead of a dialog, resembling the standard awesome bar.</description>

An example of how it runs currently would be a 100... setting a plugin to 50 would throttle its execution by half. (2) The optional ability to be able to suspend such plugin for example if all firefox windows are minimized. (3) The ability to suspend/resume some/all objects on a given page of a given plugin, from a toolbar button, menu, etc. (4) The ability to limit the number of instances, either on one page or globally, that a given plugin object can be used. (Example here would be loading a site that has an excessive number of flash objects (10+) and being able to limit it to 2 objects on that page max.) Reproducible: Always</description>

      <title>Need an automatic 404 broken link reporter broken link that reports to the web page creator when external link breaks / becomes unavailable.</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.2) Gecko/2008091620 Firefox/3.0.2 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.2) Gecko/2008091620 Firefox/3.0.2 When i visit a website i frequently encounter 404 errors and often cannot find a way to notify the creator of the web page that the web page no longer is working. It occurs that this task could be automated by the browser generating a message to the creator including the web link and updating the count number of people who could not get thru. It could also be done at the same time as the attempt so as not to report when the users web connection is shut off. This would have the tendency of cleaning up the whole internet a little bit. Of course it should be optional to the user to turn this feature on/off so that privacy issues are avoided. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.Go to any web page. 2.click on a kink that doesnt work. 3.result 404 error. 4attempt to contact web master of site. Actual Results: lots of effort is wasted informing web master whose info is burried on page, ... ... or not!!! Expected Results: broken link trigers reprorter program that informs web master of broken links location in page and url. and adds to a counter. and reports to mt that the link has been reported. 404- error. This feature does not exist in MS products to the best of my knowelege. and would show the superority of mozilla firefox!!!</description>

      <title>nsIContentPrefService should provide an interface for listing stored prefs.</title>
      <description>I was working on an extension to add some site-specific preferences, and nsIContentPrefService was a natural fit for this. It made setting and checking for a preference nice and easy. But I also wanted to add some management UI to allow the user to see what preferences they had set, and delete/modify them if they don't want them stored any more. There's no API to do anything like this, so I had to use cps.DBConnection to query the DB directly. It would be nice to be able to do something like: var cps = Cc["..."].getService(Ci.nsICPS); var prefs = cps.getAllSitePrefs("my.pref.name") // prefs is an array for (i=0; i&lt;prefs.length; i++) dump("Host: " + prefs[i].hostname + " set to " + prefs[i].value) I suppose a getAllPrefNames() API might be useful to have too. A secondary issue is that the hostname retrieved from the DB this way is not a proper URL (just "www.host.com"), but all the nsICPS interfaces require a nsIURI to modify or delete the pref. This can be fudged by prepending "http://" to the string and running it though ioService.newURI(), not sure if there's a better way to do it.</description>

      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_5_5; en-us) AppleWebKit/525.18 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/3.1.2 Safari/525.20.1 Build Identifier: We at CNS Vital Signs would like to request that the shiftLeft property for the keydown and keyup events be implemented in the FireFox web browser. CNS Vital Signs has developed software that presents a series of computerized neurocognitive tests that are designed to be used as a routine part of a clinical practice, as a research instrument, and in schools or workplaces where health and safety are an issue. The CNS Vital Signs test battery offers 54 languages and has been utilized as a research tool in over 35 countries world wide. The tests run on a PC and are designed to collect responses from patients and calculate performance scores based on the accuracy and timing of the response. The original program was a stand-alone application that is downloaded and installed on the PC. We have recently released a web version of the same program. One of the tests originally written makes use of the right and left shift keys. Patients are asked to press the left shift key or the right shift key to respond to a presented rule. Currently, only Internet Explorer has implemented the shiftLeft property for the keydown and keyup events. Our pharmacutical customers require the web version of our test be identical in nature to the local version, so we have had to restrict all web deployments to support Internet Explorer only. We have programmed the web application to use the right and left arrow keys for other browsers but we have had to restrict it's use to clinical practice use. Thanks for considering our request.

      <title>Open Dialog should open last folder linked with the current url</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; fr; rv:1.9.0.3) Gecko/2008092417 Firefox/3.0.3 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; fr; rv:1.9.0.3) Gecko/2008092417 Firefox/3.0.3 When we are on a web page, we often get fields which propose to load or download files, like gmail or yahoo mail account to send a file. The Open Dialog Box always opens the last opened folder in Firefox. That's ok. But this should be if the last folder is linked with the current url, to open a specific folder in function of the web page on which we are. For example, if I'm on gmail, the button opens the gmail local folder on my machine, and on yahoo mail, the yahoo local folder. Reproducible: Didn't try Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3. I don't know how to manage the link between url and folder, because, we can't take all the url (it's often generated and always different) and it can't be too short with only the principal web name, sometimes we can go on different web site with the same principal name.</description>

      <title>Firefox needs a way to keep track which add-on is installed and warn users when a new one is added</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.3) Gecko/2008092417 Firefox/3.0.3 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729) Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.3) Gecko/2008092417 Firefox/3.0.3 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729) More and more, companies have started to add Firefox plugins or extensions when you install software, and they rarely if ever ask for permission. The latest one is Microsoft .NET 3.5. When you install the latest .NET SP1 it does the following, without telling you (unless you go see the features notes) - Add the .NET Framework extension to Firefox - Disable the 'Uninstall' button on it using a registry key - Put the extension files deep in C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET so you can't find it easily - Add an extra string to your User Agent so every site you go to now knows you're running the extension, you know just in case a security hole is found in it someday All this is obviously very bad. Firefox needs to have a secure way to check what extensions and plugins are installed, and before it loads new ones because some program decided to dump an entry in there, it needs to warn the user. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Install Microsoft .NET 3.5 SP1 2. Look at your extensions 3.</description>

I don't know it is a fixable thing, but the Date object behaves weird. When I create a new Date instance the year points to the right year. The day points to the right day. But the month is begin from 0. I know it is documented, but instead of that can't you do something against it? It is difficult to compare real dates with this. Especially all websites I know stores January as the 12th month. Thx for your time. David Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

The essence of the approach is in more precise targeting that is defined by the user. Now advertisement targeting is carried out in such way. A web-master defines a list of keywords. An ad-server shows relevant ad. In this case a website is in an intermediate between the users` interests and advertisement conents. I suggest that Firefox would provide a possibility for the user to define one`s interests by his own. A user should have a possibility to describe a set of keywords, that correspond to one`s interests. These keywords should be available for the queried pages to propose relevant content and ads. A web-page should have a possibility to propose a user to extend and to detail the list of keywords with the supposed ones. This suggestion can increase advertisement efficiency and overall use for the surfers. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: - Actual Results: - Expected Results: - -</description>

There should be a toggle in about:config to allow a user who enters PB mode to not make any connections which are not secure. I propose this for its usefulness for whistle-blowers or others in need of secure communication for whatever reason who could be damaged by an errant, unexpected insecure connection. Also, because it is my assumption this would be relatively easy to code once the private browsing infrastructure is in place. Reproducible: Always</description>

This step seems to be a little unnecessary as most anti-virus programs will scan the application the each time it is accessed; many may have already scanned it as soon as the download completed anyway. It would be nice if a user could goto the Preferences -&gt; Main tab and check/uncheck a box that asks "Automatically scan downloaded content for viruses" or something similar. Since you can already disable the scanning by changing the "browser.download.manager.scanWhenDone" property from true (the default) to false in about:config, the only changes required are to link that preference to a checkbox. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Simply download a file with antivirus software installed 2.

The infobar could have options to allow the website to resize their window, or ignore it (by default) Could this be written directly to the tree, or should it be done as an extension? Currently I've been working on adding such an option through the tree. If needed, I could redo this as an extension. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

Until now Firefox only allows to export all the bookmarks. That, some times it isn't so good because for example if you want to have an html file with certain bookmarks to give it to a friend or even more to keep it for your self, you have to have Dreamweaver or something else installed to PC to edit the html file. That, as you can see, can take up a lot of time. As a result i think it would be very nice, when you select certain bookmarks in the Library, to add, in the drop down menu, the menu "Export selected Bookmarks... " with options "Backup" and "Export HTML" (Of course this would be very nice for the History too). Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Go to Library 2. Go to your bookmarks section 3.

This then show me a dialogue where I can view a list of "site" and "Username". To actually see the passwords I then have to click another button called "Show Passwords". At this point Firefox then puts up a third button which displays a totally useless "Are you sure you want to show your passwords" modal dialogue which I have to click "Yes" to confirm that I want to view my passwords. Er... isn't the *whole point* of the dialogue that I want to see my stored passwords ? The "Tools &gt; Options &gt; Security &gt; Show Passwords" button should show me a dialogue which immediately show a list of "Site", "Username" and "Password". All these other buttons are superfluous and serve no purpose other than to waste my time. They provide no security and they provide absolutely zero useful functionality. Sorry but I think the current design is poor and should be replaced. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Go to "Tools" &gt; "Options" &gt; "Security" 2. Click "Show Passwords" button 3. Wonder why you have to press two more buttons to see your passwords ? I'd really like Firefox to focus more on getting out of the way.

      <title>Encrypt and Password Protect Cookies, You know for Notebooks : )</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.3) Gecko/2008092417 Firefox/3.0.3 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.3) Gecko/2008092417 Firefox/3.0.3 It think it would be swell to be able to password protect and encrypt my cookies, so of anyone got a hold of my laptop, they may not learn which financial institutions I belong to. I know that there is a global security password, but this would allow a granularity that I don't have to sign in my browser every time I use it--and have a measure of security as far as the cookies are concerned. Thank You, BrendaEM For now, I tend to add red-hearing cookies to banks I don't a even belong to, just so if anyone gets my computer, they might not know which accounts I have.

      <title>Option to only use a single window (e.g. clicking QuickLaunch when Firefox is already open)</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.3) Gecko/2008092417 Firefox/3.0.3 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.3) Gecko/2008092417 Firefox/3.0.3 Can FireFox include support for 'Single Instance of FireFox' even if multiple times QuickLaunch is clicked or some program is opening new window? The tabbed browsing is powerful, I agree and hence this, I hope, would richly complement and serve as a patronage for tab browsing feature and reducing the clutter of multiple instance of the application on the task bar besides reducing the memory consumption. Isn't it? Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: (Not applicable. It is a Feature Request)</description>

      <title>Add a slide animation when rearranging tabs (a la Safari)</title>
      <description>When the tabbar overflows, we have a really nice sliding animation for the left and right buttons. When a tab is dragged, a little arrow appears, and when the tab is released, the tabs just instantly are rearranged. In Safari, as the tab is dragged the other tabs will slide out of the way in a nice fluid manner. I think it'd be a really nice bit of polish if we had a similar function.</description>

Safari .webarchive file format introduced with Safari 2.0 Safari .webarchive format embed a whole rich webpage into one file, making it really smarter than the standard html+folder. this should be, if not the default format, at least supported by FF3 on Mac platform! as a side note, other Mac-specific browsers like iCab and Sunrise support webarchive format, so it shouldn't be that hard to implement...

      <title>Auto verify: was page saved correctly or was not</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; ru; rv:1.9.0.3) Gecko/2008092416 Firefox/3.0.3 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; ru; rv:1.9.0.3) Gecko/2008092416 Firefox/3.0.3 (excuse me for my bad english) As we know, all programs that longer that 10 lines contains errors. If program have no errors - this just mean that errors was not discovered yet... joke :-) It is always possible that web page will not saved correctly because of bugs in browser. Sometimes this errors is silent: user click "save page", browser did not give any error message but page was corrupted/was not saved. I saw such errors in Opera, in Mozilla and in Konqueror. So, user can't be sure that his/her info was saved. And this is very annoying: if you save something important - then you should: - go to the place where page was saved and look: does saved document exists? - close network connection (or go to offline mode) and clean the cache to be sure that browser will read document only from disk; - open document and look: does document saved correctly? Does images saved? I will be good if process of verify page saving will be automated. I want to offer some levels of such verification. First of all, there should be an option [V] Verify page saving :-) Level 1. Just control that file(s) of saved page exists. I really saw a situation when browser silently do nothing when user try save page. Level 2. Automatically and invisible for user try to open saved document. I saw a situations when browser could not open some pictures/frames in saved page. If verifying was failed then browser should open message like this: "Page was not saved correctly because of internal program error. Please try to save page under different name that contains only digits and latin characters. What you wish to do now? [V] Try to save page again [V] Send bug report to developers" IMHO you will catch many interesting bugs with this feature :-) [I will also try to send this feature request to other browsers developers. Let's make world better :-) ] Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce</description>

      <title>Master password prompt is a modal dialog</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-GB; rv:1.9.0.3) Gecko/2008092510 Ubuntu/8.04 (hardy) Firefox/3.0.3 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-GB; rv:1.9.0.3) Gecko/2008092510 Ubuntu/8.04 (hardy) Firefox/3.0.3 Firefox has made good progress in making password saving work with a drop-down bar rather. Not just because the modal dialog was impractical. It was also annoying. The modal dialog that informed you that a server wasn't responding was also removed. Again, because it was annoying. Using these as a precedent I'm going to put forward the following as a bug rather than a feature request. When asked for the master password a modal dialog box pops up and interrupts your surfing experience when you don't necessarily want to use it. For example, the following instances: 1) If you don't want to log in to a site but there is a log-in form in the corner of the front page. 2) If other people are using your computer and they want to log in to their account and not yours. (For me, one of the reasons that the master password exists is so you can let friends use your computers without worrying.) Of course, the trade off is that using the master password would require an extra click but this is not a big deal since you do not need to do this many times. (As a side note, developers should go through every modal dialog in Firefox and ask themselves if it's absolutely necessary that they are modal and that they exist. Having said that, the only other ones I can think of that still are exist are security warnings and are fairly important.) Hopefully, this will be easy to implement if there is a very standard way to call upon those slide-down bars. I don't know what they're called. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Save a password for a website. 2. Activate the master password feature. 3. Visit the site's log-in page, without the intention of using the saved password. Actual Results: A useless modal dialog appears, that won't let you do anything until you click cancel or press escape. Expected Results: An unobtrusive bar slides down at the top of the browser asking if you would like to enter the master password, with a button to click on to do so.</description>

      <title>Add "default bookmark" as a managed annotation</title>
      <description>We'd like to see an annotation that is assigned to bookmarks that are added by Mozilla to Firefox profiles as part of a default set. Being able to differentiate between those bookmarks that have been added by the user and those that were provided automatically enables applications that care about the difference. Key to this is that the annotation be managed such that it is either removed entirely or adjusted when the user modifies the bookmark. In a gold-plated implementation, this would enable an extension to differentiate between three kinds of bookmarks: those added by the user, those added by the system, and those added by the system but subsequently modified by the user. IIRC, there is an annotation-based system that is used to attach version numbers to system-provided smart bookmark defaults. But these annotations aren't altered when the user modifies the bookmark, so some of the desired semantics above are lost. And I don't believe that these annotations are used at all with default non-smart bookmarks. We'd be willing to contribute the patch for this but would love to get some guidance and feedback from the community first.</description>

That works pretty except in the following cases. Typing "some" will not match "www.somesite.com", but will "somesite.com" It will also match "someusername:password@unrelatedsite.com" I'd like to suggest either as a change to setting "3" or as a possible additional "4", that it not count the "www." as part of what it matches, and that it also not count login information in what it matches, but still goes from the beginning.

      <title>Request for an event be sent when session/window load is complete and for a way to determine the reason a tab was restored (load or restoration of closed tab)</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1b1) Gecko/20081007 Firefox/3.1b1 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1b1) Gecko/20081007 Firefox/3.1b1 In the Session Manager extension, I currently use the SSTabRestored event to trigger a reload of the tab if a reload option is set. I only want this to trigger on a session load. I do not want it to trigger for restored closed tabs. Previously I used a tab value to determine if the tab was allowed to restore or not, but this required hooking into the undoCloseTab functionality in Firefox which was very messy and could easily break stuff. I now count the number of tabs that should be restored and only reload that number of tabs. Theoretically there should be a SSTabRestored event for every tab in the session, but I've found that that isn't always the case. I've found that an SSTabRestored event is not sent: 1. If the user closes the window or tabs while the restore is in progress. 2. For blank tabs in Firefox 3.1 nightlies. I can work around #2 above by checking if the tabs have entries lengths (messy but it works), but there is no reliable way to work around problem #1 since if closed fast enough there isn't even a close event notification. Additional problems occur if the user decides to recover a closed tab while the load is taking place since that causes an additional SSTabRestored event to be triggered which also throws off my count. There should be an event that gets sent once the session load has completely finished. There should also be a way to differentiate tabs restored by loading a session or tabs restored from a closed state. Reproducible: Always</description>

      <title>Saving pages: add options for clearing filenames to conform filesystem limitations</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; ru; rv:1.9.0.3) Gecko/2008092416 Firefox/3.0.3 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; ru; rv:1.9.0.3) Gecko/2008092416 Firefox/3.0.3 At this time (oct 2008) at least IE, Opera, Konqueror and Firefox use page name as default file name when saving page. It is works fine in Windows + IE. I do not using this combination so I do not know why. But it works terrible under Slackware 12.1 (locale ru_RU.UTF-8) + Firefox / Konqueror / Opera. The problem is: page names can contain symbols that have special meaning for some filesystems / operating systems / applications. For example, lets see on names of this (Mozilla's own!) page: http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/ Firefox will try save it with name "Mozilla | Firefox web browser &amp; Thunderbird email client.html" by default. Filename has symbol "|" that used for making pipelines in command.com, cmd.exe and Bash command lines and symbol "&amp;" that also has special meaning at least in Bash. I want to describe a real situation that I have on Slackware 12.1 (locale ru_RU.UTF-8) + Opera (It can be same with Firefox): 1. User save all pages with names that Opera suggests by default to HDD with ext3 filesystem. 2. User try to move this saved pages to other disk with FAT filesystem with Midnight Commander. 3. User views message like this "Can't move file: incorrect argument" from Midnight Commander and don't understand anything. This an summary of problem when saving pages with page names = filenames. 1. The filenames often are very long =&gt; user should spend time to do filename shorter. 2. Filenames can contain special characters that will confuse some software =&gt; user should spend time and change/delete this characters. 3. If page was saved as "bad~!@#$%^&amp;name.hmtl + bad~!@#$%^&amp;name_files" and if this filename will confuse some software then user should spend time to rename html and then open it in text editor and replace all links to bad~!@#$%^&amp;name_files in html. IMHO it will be good if Firefox will have some options for automatic clearing names of files when saving pages. Firefox now has a functionality that can be usable for this options: sometimes Firefox want to save pages with original name of page file, not with page name. Names of original files are often more accurate than page names. Example: http://axum.ru/shop/rules/1 Firefox wants to save this page as "1.html", not "axum.ru / О магазине.html". Extended options can looks like this (very approximately): ( ) use original file name for saved file when possible else page name (*) always use page name as name for saved file [V] truncate file name to [ 31] characters [V] replace this symbols [ @] to phrase [(at)] [V] replace this symbols [ ] to phrase [_] [V] replace this symbols [ `'",.:] to phrase [-] [V] replace this symbols [ #№] to phrase [N] [V] replace this symbols [ ~!$%^&amp;*] to phrase [G] [V] replace this symbols [ |\/] to phrase [l] [ ] replace all national alphabet characters to its latin transliterations except languages: [en, ru] [Change...] Replace all other non-alphabet and non-digital symbols to phrase [-] --------------------------------------- Regards, Sergey Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Go to "http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/" page. 2. Press "File" -&gt; "Save as..." Actual Results: The suggested filename is "Mozilla | Firefox web browser &amp; Thunderbird email client.html" It contains special charactrs "|" and "&amp;". Expected Results: Such special symbols must be filtered in some way from suggested filename. For example: "Mozilla I Firefox web browser 8 Thunderbird email client.html" or "Mozilla_Firefox_web_browser_and_Thunderbird_email_client.html" P.S. I also send such feature request to Konqueror and Opera: they have such problem too.</description>

It allows a web surfer to more quickly recognize when a site may be edited. It is a convenience to web surfers who are already inclined to contribute, and an invitation to those who have yet to discover the thrill of building a common resource. As this kind of public editing becomes more commonplace, the button may become regarded as a badge of honor. It serves as an incentive to encourage companies and site developers to add publicly-editable components to their sites, in order to have the UEB displayed for their sites. The hope is that this button catalyzes the acceleration of the editable web, and helps accelerate society's trend toward building valued common resources.

      <title>Default Search Engine Should be Random</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Build Identifier: Using Google as the default seems to favor one vendor quite heavily as defaults are rarely changed by casual users. Instead, there should be a '[Random]' choice when searching to enhance privacy (not all casual searches will go to the same provider) and discourage monopolies from becoming entrenched. Perhaps there could even be groups of engines which could be chosen from randomly (or sequentially, or all in tabs) when the search group is selected. For example, one may have a 'dictionary' group of search providers just for finding the meaning of a word or phrase. Or one may have a 'shopping' search group.

This is not the same as the third option in preferences (restore the session every time you close FF). I can't see the use of this option. Having shut FF down, but not the operating system, why would you want to ALWAYS open the new session at the same place?. However, if you've finished working for the day and close your operating system down as well as FF, it makes sense to want to open it when you restart your operating system at the same tabs and windows. With FF2, you used to be able to achieve this by not closing down your FF windows and tabs when you closed your o/s, FF would assume it had crashed and give you the option when you restarted it and the o/s to restore the previous session. This was a very very useful feature as I often have two or three windows open and several tabs and it's not one in IE Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

I have written/added some script in the browser.js file with assistance from a few other individuals. If interested, I would like to submit this data so that it could be used to create an option during the installation of Firefox to turn File Manager on/off a little bit easier than changing js files.

However there is also the reverse animation when moving OUT of full screen mode, which does not seem to be covered by this or another preference. It would be good to be able to prevent this animation too. For example: * There could be a "browser.fullscreen.animateDown" preference, for coming out of full screen mode. * or, there could be a "browser.fullscreen.animate" preference, which applied to both going into and out of full screen mode. (since it is likely that people either want animation, or don't want animation - the subset of people who want animation in one direction but not in the other is likely to be fairly small). Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open about:config and set browser.fullscreen.animateUp to 0 2. Press F11 to enter full screen mode. Observe no animation. 3. Press F11 to exit full screen mode. Observe there is animation.</description>

As you can see on the page referenced above OpenPrinting has agreed on switching from PostScript to PDF as standard print job format. This decision was made between printing system and driver developers, application developers, desktop developers, and many major printer manufacturers. I want to ask you whether you can switch from PostScript to PDF as print job output format in the upcoming 3.0 series of OpenOffice.org. This should not be a big change as OOo is already capable of generating PDF via the "Export to PDF" function. This code could be re-used. It could also be done in a way that it is run-time configurable whether PostScript or PDF gets generated with default set at build time. This does not require all distributions to switch to a PDF-centric workflow as CUPS has a pdftops filter and so it converts the PDF input to PostScript if it does not have the filters for disrectly working with PDF. As you can also see on the referenced web page, KDE and Qt applications already send jobs in PDF and OpenPrinting has organized the development of the CUPS filters for the PDF printing workflow. Debian and Ubuntu already include CUPS packages with PDF-based printing workflow. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

      <title>Enhancement - Install add-on updates automatically with no dialog boxes or interaction</title>

This box opens even if every auto-install option in the Advanced-update tab is selected, because none of them automate installation of add-on updates. I want an option to just install the add-on updates automatically, with no user interaction at all. (It would, however, be appropriate to pop a window if an update fails!) I don't care if there are updates, just install them. I've already demonstrated that I'm ok with the add-on by installing it. I don't need to know about every minor update. I realize not everyone will agree, and I'm not saying this should be the default. I'm more than happy to check an "Advanced" box that says "Eff it, just install all add-on updates automatically". :) NOTE - THIS IS NOT THE SAME AS AUTO-UPDATES TO FIREFOX. THIS IS ABOUT UPDATES TO ADD-ONS. (I've had too many people ask me to check if the auto-install FF updates radio button was selected. It's not the same thing!) Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Install an add-on. Try ColorfulTabs. That silly (beautiful, but silly!) thing seems to be updated hourly. 2. An update to the add-on is released. 3. An annoying window opens on Firefox startup asking if you want to install the add-on update. 4. Grumble and click ok 5. Grumble again and click "continue" when the extremely unnecessary "updates were successful" window opens. 6. Firefox finally opens and you can get back to actual productivity (or determined lack thereof). Actual Results: I got annoyed and wasted time instead of going directly to a functional Firefox browser. Expected Results: Well, if this enhancement is added, I would have gone directly to Firefox with no extra clicking or dialog.</description>

      <title>Add an API for getting web progress notifications for all tabs</title>
      <description>tabbrowser has addProgressListener, this allows you to register a progress listener for whichever is the visible tab. Frequently in extension development you want to hear about events from all tabs. There are also likely to be useful uses for this within the product (bug 386835 will need this f.e.). I propose adding a pair of new methods to tabbrowser, addAllProgressListener (please someone think of a better name) and removeAllProgressListener. It will register a progress listener that gets notified for all tabs, background or foreground. It will be passed a variant on nsIWebProgressListener. Essentially the object will have all the same methods with an additional argument, the browser element that fired the event.</description>

      <title>Add tabs to the Clear Recent History dialog box</title>
      <description>The difference between browser history and session data exists primarily on an implementation level, and not necessarily inside of the user's mind (unless the user has been involved with Firefox development.) I think we should add tabs to the Clear Recent History dialog, since clearing all information from a particular time period, but leaving certain tabs open from that time period is counter intuitive. Another issues is how the Clear Recent History dialog relates to private browsing mode: Something that I am worried about is that the user opens several embarrassing tabs, and then opens up private browsing mode. As the start page suggestions, they clear their recent history using the Clear Recent History dialog. Of course, history isn't the same thing as active tabs (in the implementation model, but not the user's mental model), so these embarrassing tabs are persisted in the previous session. The user eventually closes down Firefox, and leaves. The next person to load Firefox will see the sensitive tabs, even though the user thought they were taking every action they needed to in order to cover their tracks.</description>

Such system can be used with a normal keyboard and mouse or through a remote control, both connected throught USB. "Remote Control" needs the "Multipress" input method (http://www.murrayc.com/blog/permalink/2007/01/25/gtk-multipress-input-method/) so that the same key represents a set of letters/symbols (just like an standard mobile phone). Since Firefox doesn't let to change the IM once started the system must "reboot" Firefox whenever udev notifies the keyboard has been attached/dettached. It would be ideal if it were some way to change the IM through a firefox --rsync to integrate with system scripts.

This should not close the browser. Instead, one of the following should happen: 1) The 'Close Tab' context menu option should not be available if there is only one tab open. 2) When 'Close Tab' is clicked on the only open tab in a window, it should cause the tab to go to the about:blank page. Note: There is an existing bug 128631 that was filed based on the old tabbing behavior. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open browser (with one tab open) 2.

      <title>Prevent XSS with &lt;meta name=disablescripts&gt; or &lt;untrusted&gt;&lt;/untrusted&gt;</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686 (x86_64); en-US; rv:1.8.1.13) Gecko/20080313 SeaMonkey/1.1.9 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686 (x86_64); en-US; rv:1.8.1.13) Gecko/20080313 SeaMonkey/1.1.9 This is an idea to make Gecko based browsers much less susceptible to cross site scripting attacks. It will require some discussion to fine tune, but I believe the concept would be a major leap in browser security. Because of many great Gecko features, such as the ability to recognize 63 different encodings for the character "&lt;", it is _extremely_ difficult for Web 2.0 type applications to filter user input to _reliably_ avoid cross site scripting. An application may filter the word "javascript" from a user provided URL, but how may would filter "jav&amp;#x09;ascript", which also works? Similarly back end code may remove the "&lt;" character, but Gecko recognizes roughly 62 other ways of representing that character. Enter &lt;meta name=disablescripts&gt;. Blogs, message boards, tube sites, or any other site which displays user generated content could use such a tag to tell Firefox to turn off scripting for that page, thereby neutering all current and future scripting based attacks. It may also be decided that such a tag should also disable Java and other clearly risky functionality. Probably it would also be recoginized when used as an HTTP header. Even better would be to be able to surround user generated content with &lt;untrusted&gt;&lt;/untrusted&gt;, but that would seem to require making sure that the nefarious user doesn't inject &lt;/untrusted&gt; along with the other malicious content, so &lt;/untrusted&gt; would at least have to be treated strictly - &lt;/untrusted&lt;img src="legit.gif&gt; must not be allowed to work, for example. This end tag problem may be insurmountable, meaning that using &lt;meta name=disablescripts&gt; to disable scripts on the entire page is the best we can do, and that would sure be better than the current state of affairs. Any page marked &lt;meta name=disablescripts&gt; could have no script based attacks, period, because scripts simply wouldn't be executed. Reproducible: Always</description>

      <title>Show a fixed order list in addition to MRU list for tab previews</title>
      <description>One particular use case of the "list all tabs" button seems to be to access a 'well known' tab. Perhaps tab #1 has mail and tab #2 has rss, etc. The old behavior required just clicking the list and selecting the first entry. With only a MRU list, people now need to search for that tab. Instead of only showing a MRU list, we can show another ordering of tabs that behaves like the old list. A few ways to make the list: 1) tab order (tab 1 first, tab 2 next) 2) oldest tab first (first tab keeps its spot even if reordered) 3) adaptively track tabs picked from the list One potential way to show two lists is to keep the same layout with some visuals to separate them. Keyboard presses can explicitly move between the lists. /------------\ | |search| | |_F1__F2__F3_| &lt;-- fixed list | M1 M2 M3 | &lt;-- default ctrl-tab focus | M4 M5 M6 | &lt;-- MRU list \------------/ Pressing ctrl-tab will focus M2, and multiple presses to tab after M6 will load the next page of tabs. If the user explicitly presses up from the M list into F, tabbing from F3 will load the next page. Searching would just show a single list of matching tabs. Perhaps when tabbing off the last F3 or M6, the next page can be filled with just the fixed list or just the MRU list. Or maybe show 2 rows of the "current list" to allow switching into the other list.</description>

The idea is that for debugging or figuring out what a server is doing, it would be useful for the browser to record a transcript of its communication, including multiple tcp streams. This could sort of be done by a packet sniffer except that it can't deal with encryption, so of course I'd like to tap into the decrypted streams. So the first question: does this already exist? If so, how do I use it? If not, is it the sort of thing that you are likely to do soon? And if not, can you offer advice for me if I want to try to do it myself? And if I send such a facility, do you think you're likely to add it to the code base? Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

      <title>Little arrow to right of Star icon is missing tooltip</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.3) Gecko/2008092417 Firefox/3.0.3 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729) Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.3) Gecko/2008092417 Firefox/3.0.3 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729) Just to the right of the Star icon there's a little black down-arrow. I don't know what this arrow is; hovering over it with the mouse does not reveal a tooltip. Clicking on it brings up a seemingly random list of URLs. These URLs are not the same as those in my "Most Visited" smart bookmark, nor my "Recently Visited". Perhaps this is a list of URLs I visit a lot, irrespective of whether or not I've bookmarked them? Perhaps it's a list of URLs I've visited recently, weighted by how often I've visited them? Deciding to be clever, I right clicked on the arrow and chose "customize", figuring I could drag it out of the bar and into the pallet getting me a description, but as soon as the pallet appears, the arrow vanishes, cloaking its identity in shadow. I even tried entering "chrome://browser/content/browser.xul" and using Firebug to inspect the arrow. Hovering over it brings up the 'textbox id="urlbar"' element, but none of the child elements in the urlbar have IDs that seem to correspond to that little down arrow. It is obviously not the identity-box, nor the feed-button, the star-button, the go-button... I seriously doubt it is the safebrowsing-url-icon. It seems it is mysteriously absent, even in the XUL code. Going to "Help"-&gt;"Help Contents", there's a list of "Handy References" in the right hand column, none of which are "Main Firefox Window". Searching the Firefox help for "small arrow next to star icon" and variations thereof result in 0 hits. Perhaps it has something to do with auto-complete? The format is the same as the awesome-bar's auto complete. I type in "http://www.slash", click the down arrow, and my auto-complete is replaced by the strange random list of URLs. Truly, this little arrow is a mystery wrapped in an enigma. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Hover mouse over the little drop-down arrow to the right of the star control, and to the left of the search box drop-down. Actual Results: Nothing happens. The user has no idea what this control is supposed to do. A control which could be quite useful remains unused, it's purpose unfulfilled. The user feels depressed and confused, and takes to drinking heavily. Expected Results: A tooltip appears, bringing about enlightenment and understanding in Firefox users everywhere. This exciting and time saving drop down (whatever it is) increases the user's productivity, allowing them to get on with important matters, such as ending the energy crisis, or solving climate change.</description>

Everywhere else I can make a distinction between favicons (usually 16px) and theme-provided menuicons. In the Places Library and sidebar there is no icon property and no noicon property, so I must use 16-pixel icons, which my users find hard to see. If the icon/noicon properties present in the session restore dialog were available in the Places tree, I could provide 24-pixel menuicons where websites do not have favicons.

I am a big fan of the Hide Menubar extension (sadly broken by 3.1b1) and I was thinking that it isn't that hard to implement by default - a button to show/hide the menubar permanently and press ALT to show it temporarily. Otherwise it's just wasting vertical screen estate there! Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 0. Press ALT to show menubar temporarily --- 1. Right click on any toolbar 2. (Un)Check "Main Toolbar" Actual Results: No such feature :( Expected Results: 0. - menubar is shown and usable temporarily (until returned to normal) --- 1&amp;2. - menubar is shown always</description>

      <description>Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1b2pre) Gecko/20081114 Minefield/3.1b2pre When the History sidebar is set to group by "By Site" or "By Date and Site", the context menu for a site container should have the "Forget About This Site" item. It is a bit unintuitive to have to expand the site container and bring up the context menu for an individual page to delete the complete history for the site. Steps to Reproduce: 1.Open the History sidebar. 2.Click the sidebar's "View" button and select "By Site". 3.Open the context menu for a site container. Actual Results: There is no way to delete all history (cookies, cache, downloads, permissions, etc.) for the site. There is only a "Delete" command that AFAIK only removes the site from the visited site's list. Expected Results: There should be a "Forget About This Site" command that delete all history related to the site.</description>

      <title>incremental link search should prioritize visible links</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.4) Gecko/2008102920 Firefox/3.0.4 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.4) Gecko/2008102920 Firefox/3.0.4 When doing an incremental search for a link ("quick find (links only)" is what shows up at the bottom of the window; the default keyboard shortcut for this is the apostrophe key), currently visible links which match the input text should be given priority over matching links which are in parts of the page not currently being viewed. A user who cannot use a mouse and wants to follow a link can only use this search function to easily "click" a link. Suppose you have been reading a page and see right in front of your eyes the link you want to follow. You press apostrophe, insert part of the string caption of that link and... Firefox will often zoom you back to the top of the page, since there is another matching link right there! Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Go to a page where two links with the caption "dog" occur in positions where they cannot both be simultaneously viewed (given the size of your Firefox window and screen resolution). 2. Navigate to the part of the page where the *second* such link is visible. 3. Press 'apostrophe' to active the "quick search (links only)" feature. 4. Type into the search box 'dog'. Actual Results: After performing the four actions I described above, Firefox will take you to the *first* matching 'dog' link, rather than highlighting/selecting the link you were viewing at the moment you pressed the apostrophe key. This is extremely disorienting and frustrating behavior. Expected Results: I suggest that links *which are currently visible* be given priority when using the incremental search for links feature. I believe one can safely assume that a user who presses the apostrophe key is interested in highlighting/selecting a link which is currently visible, rather than one in a part of the page which she cannot currently see.</description>

      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.9.0.4) Gecko/2008102920 Firefox/3.0.4 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.9.0.4) Gecko/2008102920 Firefox/3.0.4 I have noticed users, multiple clicking the firefox icon on go-slow computers when the application is taking a while to startup, resulting in frustration and finally many instances opening. Suggest first thing firefox does is throw up a splash screen, confirming that it is indeed trying to start, and to wait. This should give more of an air of positivity to those unsure if their double click has been registered. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

      <title>RFE: per-profile firefox anti-phishing urlclassifier3.sqlite is wasteful, want system-wide copy</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; cs-CZ; rv:1.9.0.4) Gecko/2008111217 Fedora/3.0.4-1.fc10 Firefox/3.0.4 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; cs-CZ; rv:1.9.0.4) Gecko/2008111217 Fedora/3.0.4-1.fc10 Firefox/3.0.4 (originally filed in the Red Hat bugzilla) Firefox-3 contains a new anti-phishing mechanism which relies on a regularly-updated database (from Google). This database (urlclassifier3.sqlite) sits in each profile (so a single user can have multiple copies), and it looks like expected site nowadays (there were some bugs earlier) is ~55MB. For space-constrained home directories this is a problem - we now have regularly users running out of home directory quota thanks to this database. (The total disk space wasted over here is not so bad, just 1TB raw disk... but fixing user quota problems costs manpower). We would like an option to move this database to a centrally-updated (and read-only, for the users) location. Ideally, this would happen automatically, i.e. by checking a system-wide database first (for freshness, i.e. less than 2 days old) before deciding to download the data to the local profile. Known workarounds: * anti-phishing can be turned off and the file deleted (http://kb.mozillazine.org/Urlclassifier2.sqlite). Requires intervention per user, turns off a useful security feature =&gt; bad. * the file size can be temporarily reduced by "vacuum"ing the database. Requires intervention per user, gives temporary relief only and is supposed to eventually be done automatically(? unclear since this causes fragmentation, [1] ). But even a nicely cleaned database is expected to be in the 40MB-range. =&gt; no real gain. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.just use firefox on the server with many many users 2. 3. Actual Results: tons of disk space is wasted by duplicate storage of read-only information Expected Results: shouldn't be Additional information: * looks like the mechanism isn't actually turned on yet (so the space is really wasted)? https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=463157 * somewhat related upstream bug: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=383031 (but people seem to be happy that this is no longer in the "roaming profile", i.e. Windows-only) * [1] https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=385834#c20 - auto-vacuum is bad and off (but for the history DB only?), full vacuum will lock up UI?</description>

Firefox should instead present a dialog asking the user to wait until the process can be relaunched, and provide a "Force Restart" button after 5-10 seconds which will kill the previous FF process and start the new one.

I think this would be a nice option to have in Firefox. It could be a check-box on the right side of the "find" bar that pops up, next to "match case." When a match is made, the photo could be highlighted by dimming the rest of the page. I really hope this is considered, I don't think it'd take *too* much extra work to implement :) Reproducible: Always</description>

This includes animated gifs, animated menus, flash objects, javascript effects, and so on. I can workaround some of them by disabling gif animations from preferences, by using flashblock extension, by turning of operating systems' gui effects. However, top and bottom bars that appear in firefox, such as 'remember password' prompt or noscripts' javascript block notifications appear with an animated transition from 0 percent visibility to 100 percent visibility. What I'd like to see is the user controlled preference of disabling firefox' user interface animations. Thank you! Reproducible: Always</description>

Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: Here's an example to illustrate it: 1. In Firefox, go to Google. 2. Search anyWord 3. In the bottom of results, go to page 2 and then to page 3. 4. No interesting results. Change the keyword to anotherWord and do another search. 5. Visit pages 2 and 3 of Google's results. 6. No. Precise the search: use now these keywords: Word1 Word2 7. Still visit pages 2 and 3 of results. 6. Precise once again the search: use now these keywords: Word1 Word2 Word3 7. Yes, we found an interesting site. Click on a site in the results. Ah, but we don't have the time to read the page now. So we close it. 8. Later, we want to find again this page. We do a search in our location bar with the keyword... we don't remember the good keyword..., so we try just Word1. Actual Results: Arrrrg, all the visible results in our location bar are Google's pages. Expected Results: In these situations, it would be very useful to be able to add for example -google to exclude Google's pages of the location bar results and see just the pages that aren't searches.</description>

      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.0.3) Gecko/2008092414 Firefox/3.0.3 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.0.3) Gecko/2008092414 Firefox/3.0.3 While reading a page where I want to open a followup tab, I want that tab to be "next". Right now it goes at the end. Even better, if I'm opening 5 different tabs while reading one page, I want those to be the next five tabs, opened in order. The first gives LIFO; the second gives "depth first". The current (open the tab at the end of the list) gives "breath first" or FIFO. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open some tabs. 2. Close that first tab, and start reading the second one. 3. Open more tabs relevant to the current page. Actual Results: Tabs relevant to the current page are at the end of the list of tabs Expected Results: Tabs relevant to the current page are after the current page, before the rest of them.</description>

I am trying to access a Java application (Primavera Timesheets) on my companies local network through JNLP. The JRE is setup to use the default browsers (Firefox) network proxy setting, but the Java application does not get the correct proxy settings. When IE is set as default browser the Java program gets the correct proxy information. When the proxy setting is configured directly in the JRE the program works correctly. The application also works correctly if Chrome is the default browser (but it seems to reuse the settings from IE, so that is no supprise). JRE expects semicolon (;) as separator when listing exceptions. Firefox use comma (,) as separator. It would be valuable if the separator character could be configured (which it does not seem to be - at least I cant find the option). JRE version: Version 6 update 10 (build 1.6.0_10-b33) Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Make sure that Firefox is default browser 2. Configure JRE to user browsers network proxy setting 3. Launch Primavera Timesheets through JNLP Actual Results: Program exits with error: Malformed reply from SOCKS server Expected Results: Jave program launched with correct network proxy settings</description>

This means that the first element in the body can't be defined by a percentage. The body height should be defined by default in pixels on page load (and any content change), thus (excuse my pseudocode): IF content.height &lt; browser_window.height THEN body.height = browser_window.height ELSE body.height = content.height This would ultimately allow a css-based full-height column layout, without faux-columns or tables. Assuming this works, other browsers should also implement it. Reproducible: Always</description>

Two reasons: 1. It would be nice to have one site-wide .cfg file on a network drive. As I understood from the guides I've read, sites using autoconfig either distribute their .cfg to all clients or share the whole Firefox installation on the net. Both methods are not always suitable. 2. Autoconfig gets broken on updates at least with several Linux distributions. This is because the install directory moves on update from e.g. /usr/lib/firefox-3.0.3 to /usr/lib/firefox-3.0.4, while the custom .cfg file does not move. This is not a problem of the distribution packaging since configuration data does not belong under /usr in the first place, but under /etc. I see no way for distributions to achieve this without patching firefox. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.Create a site configuration in /etc/firefox/site.cfg 2.Try to put paths within pref("general.config.filename", "/etc/firefox/site.cfg") Actual Results: Firefox ignores the file Expected Results: Firefox reads the file and applies the preferences</description>

      <title>Keyword in location bar should feature at least the same autocomplete as the search bar</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.1b1) Gecko/20081007 Firefox/3.1b1 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.1b1) Gecko/20081007 Firefox/3.1b1 I appreciate that the search bar exists, but it is not practical to choose one among dozens of search engines. Instead, I set a keyword for each engine, and then I use the location bar. Problem : autocomplete looks for the keyword in the history URL list (which gives nothing if my keyword looks like 'wkd'). It does not suggest my previous searches in the chosen engine. It does not show server suggestions of the chosen engine. This might look like a dupe of 438670 or 389903, but it's not. Please note that I'm talking about keywords assigned to search engines, not bookmark keywords. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Install any search engine that offers suggestions, say, the German Wikipedia 2. Go to "Manage search engine list" 3. Set keyword 'wkd' for the engine "Wikipedia (de)" 4. Go to the Location bar 5. Type in 'wkd napo' (don't hit Enter yet) 6. Type 'leon' and hit Enter 7. Go to the Location bar 8. Type in 'wkd napo' (don't hit Enter) Actual Results: No autocomplete is shown after step 5. No autocomplete is shown after step 8. Expected Results: After step 5 the German wikipedia suggestion service should autocomplete the word 'napo' with all his known article titles begining with 'napo' (about 10). After step 8 the location bar should autocomplete with 'napoleon' because it is something I've already searched in the German wikipedia. And following that item, then the German wikipedia suggestion service should autocomplete the word 'napo'. I know some cool stuff exist for autocompleting bookmark keyword searches, which I personally don't use. Maybe some cool behavior should be the same whether using a bookmark keyword or a engine keyword. I know autocompleting works wonderfully in the search box, which I personally don't use. I would kind of expect the location bar to turn itself into a "search bar mode" after I've typed a keyword + a space.</description>

      <title>The location bar should allow searching with multiple engine keywords, thus open several tabs</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.1b1) Gecko/20081007 Firefox/3.1b1 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.1b1) Gecko/20081007 Firefox/3.1b1 It is very common to search the same stuff in several websites. Say, I want to search the word 'boudoir' simultaneously in Wikipedia (w), in Google (g), and in my favorite French dictionary (tlf). I would expect the location bar to detect when I type several (N) search engine keywords in a row, and open N tabs, and let each engine search for the rest of the typed line. Pattern (please note the spaces) : (keyword )*(word )*word Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Go to the location bar 2. Type 'w g tlf boudoir' and hit Enter Actual Results: I get the Wikipedia search page for input 'g tlf boudoir' Expected Results: Open tab 1 with the Wikipedia search 'boudoir'. Open tab 2 with the Google search 'boudoir'. Open tab 3 with the French dictionary search 'boudoir'. Basically the issue is exactly the same whether you try to use bookmark keywords or search engine keywords.</description>

      <title>Suggestion for Faster Startup: Chrome Dump</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.4) Gecko/2008102920 Firefox/3.0.4 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.4) Gecko/2008102920 Firefox/3.0.4 Firefox is generally a fast browser. It loads pages far more quickly than IE, in my experience. However, it is very slow to start up. This is a major flaw that, if addressed, would, I believe, attract more people to FF. I don't know all that much about how the browser works, but from my understanding the slow startup comes from the cross-platform XUL architecture. I'm under the impression that, at startup, ff generates the chrome from the user's profile folder, then feeds that into Gecko, which renders the browser. This is what makes startup so slow. I propose, therefore, a solution that I call a "chrome dump." Basically, the browser shifts the chrome generation from startup time to shutdown time. When the browser shuts down, it generates the chrome from the user's profile folder and saves it (dumps it into) a JSON file, and saves it in the profile folder. The json would contain, i'd guess, the DOM objects for one or more of the chrome documents, such as browser.xul, etc. Then, when ff starts up, it simply executes the json using Gecko, quickly rendering the chrome. I believe that it would work, although I could be wrong in thinking that all of the browser's settings could be represented w/in a json file. Of course, there is one problem with this, which is it doesn't compensate for changes in the user's profile. For example, if you, say, install an extension, there's no problem b/c the extension would be read when the browser was building the dump on shutdown. On the other hand, when I'm synchronizing the portable firefox on my flash drive with the one on my main computer, i copy the profile folder from my home computer and overwrite the one on my flash drive with it, so the profile is changed between shutdown and startup. Now, actually, in that case there would not be a problem b/c the chrome dump would be carried over from one folder to the other as well. However, if one modified a profile more selectively, such as by using the FEBE add-on, then there would be descrepancy between the chrome dump and the actual profile. The solution to this flaw, however, is quite simple. FF would have to check for changes in the user's profile. It could do this in one of two ways: firstly by looking to see if any files in the profile folder had been modified at a date/time later than the date/time of the chrome dump, or secondly, and probably using far more time and processing power, by generating a second chrome dump and comparing it with the saved one. Of course, both of these tasks would take a while and so should not be done during startup. Rather, once the browser has loaded the chrome dump, it would immediately perform this check. Then, if it found a discrepancy, it would notify you with one of those bottom-right-hand-corner boxes saying something like "Your profile has been modified since the last shutdown. Restart Firefox to apply these changes." Of course, maybe that wouldn't work. I don't know enough about ff's inner workings; it's possible that differences between the browser chrome and the external files in the profile could cause errors, in which case I guess ff would have to force shutdown if it found a change in the profile. I don't know all the technical details of how my plan could be applied, I only have an idea for fixing the problem. In short, ff's long startup time is perhaps its biggest obstacle, and I think it's something we should try to overcome. And by we, I guess I mean you guys. Not much i can do to help, at this point the only programming i really know is javascript and a little python. Anyway, tell me if my idea is good, decent, or just plain stupid.

      <title>Add support to distribution.js to enable extension packaging and installation</title>
      <description>This is a feature enhancement request for the distribution.js module. Currently, extensions packaged with a customized distribution of Firefox are installed to the application directory. This potentially prevents the user from uninstalling the bundled extension, limiting them to disabling the extension. In addition, it is sometimes desirable to be able to limit installation of an extension or extensions for a particular locale. To address both these issues, the distribution.js should permit inclusion of extensions in the "distribution" directory, in a manner similar to how search plugins are included in the distribution directory. Mechanics: - The extension xpi (or expanded extension directory) would be packaged in the distribution/extensions/common or distribution/extensions/locale/&lt;LOCALE&gt; directory (which is copied to the appdir on installation) - On first-run (i.e. when the user profile is created), the extension(s) in the "common" directory and/or relevant locale directory would be copied/installed to the user profile directory before any UI was presented to the user - Following a successful copy/install to the user profile, and before UI is presented to the user, Firefox would be restarted to enable the extensions on firstrun. - On the ensuing restart, all other first-run activities would still occur (i.e. migration offer, display of welcome page, etc.) Notes: - extension(s) in the common directory would be installed regardless of the locale of the Firefox installation - extension(s) in the locale directory would only be installed if the installed locale of Firefox matched</description>

      <title>Add support for modifying titlebar text in distribution.js</title>
      <description>This is a feature enhancement request for the distribution.js module. A popular request for customized distributions are to modify the titlebar text string (currently the short product name), similar to what was possible with the CCK wizard. We'd like to provide similar functionality through the distribution.js module by specifying the titlebar text using a localizable, global configuration directive in distribution.ini i.e. [Global] titlebartext=titlebar text titlebartext.&lt;locale_code1&gt;=localizable titlebar text titlebartext.&lt;locale_code2&gt;=more localized titlebar text Notes: - directive should support UTF-8 encoded text - localized text trumps the global version - should be a limit to the number of characters permitted (suggest 15, need input from UX/UI team)</description>

      <title>"start fresh" option for returning Firefox users to migrate from another browser</title>
      <description>There are probably tens of millions, possibly hundreds of millions of people who downloaded some version of Firefox, tried it out, and went back to their default browser. If the length of time since their last attempt at using Firefox is greater than some number of days, we should offer to let them "start fresh" where we re-migrate from their default browser into a clean profile directory. It would be exceptionally cool if we could also somehow replace their actual Firefox install with a brand new one to ensure we've cleaned out any cruft in the install directory that may have interfered with their earlier trial.</description>

Add a "deny all pending" to just nuke all the pending cookies, possibly only in the "advanced" (see #1) section. The wildcard for cookie accept/deny may already be in there somewhere, but I need access to it at the popup rather than after I've already crashed and don't know what the Cookie URL is.</description>

If it isn't important, then I'd remove this notice and just have the progress bar. The term Housekeeping as applied to computer science may be a bit obscure for a general audience, and may produce confusion for users who cannot make the connection between actual housekeeping and what a computer program might call housekeeping.

      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.4) Gecko/2008102920 Firefox/3.0.4 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.4) Gecko/2008102920 Firefox/3.0.4 While viewing a webpage, I open a link in a new tab by doing right-click + t. This has become a familiar grammar to me. But when opening my bookmarks from bookmarks toolbar, I often accidentally do right-click + t. This deletes the bookmark from the bookmarks toolbar. The correct grammar on the toolbar for opening in a new tab is actually right-click + w. Why have two different grammars for the same function of opening a link in a new tab? Can we please have a consistent interface? Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Visit any website, right-click + t on any link. See link appear in new tab. 2. Create a bookmark in bookmarks toolbar. On bookmark, do right-click + t. See it disappear from bookmark toolbar. Actual Results: Bookmarks disappear from bookmarks toolbar when using the in-webpage grammar for opening in new tab. Expected Results: Right-click + t in bookmarks toolbar opens bookmark in new tab. It would make more sense for there to be a consistent interface: Whether in bookmarks toolbar or in webpage, right-click + t opens a link in new tab.</description>

Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Load a few pages in a few tabs in Minefield 3.2a1pre. 2. Click the List All Tabs button. 3. Right click on any of the thumbnailed tabs to get a context menu. Actual Results: There is no context menu, but there should be. Expected Results: There should be a context menu with things like Close Tab, Close All Other Tabs, Bookmark This Tab, Open in a New Window when I right click on the thumbnailed tabs. The context menu for tabs in the List All Tabs menu should ideally be the same as the context menu for tabs in the tab bar.</description>

You know - left click -&gt; customize. Because Firefox just keeps adding more features, but they are hidden away in "Tools" or other menus. There should be included toolbar buttons at least for: - Private Browsing - Clearing Private Data - Options window - View Source / Page Info - "The Big" Bookmark Organizer - Full Screen - Work Offline Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

I was confused about how to disable pages at first (which is probably due to the fact check marks, on the left, aren't in boxes, making it look like they can't be modified, IMO... Worth filing another bug for that one?). That's when I tried to press delete, and it did nothing, naturally. What do you think? Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Close Firefox "unexpectedly" 2. Get the Session Restore page 3. Select a page of your previous session, and press Del Actual Results: Nothing Expected Results: Uncheck the site</description>

      <title>Verification tool tip interferes with the ability to drag and drop bookmarks when tooltips appear</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.4) Gecko/2008102920 Firefox/3.0.4 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.4) Gecko/2008102920 Firefox/3.0.4 The favicon verification tool tip which appears when you hover over it is still making it impossible to immediately bookmark items dragged from the address bar to folders where the tool tip appears. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Attempt to drag and drop a new bookmark using the favicon in the address bar to a folder in the bookmarks toolbar where the tool tip appears. 2. Watch for a few moments as you're denied access to drop by said tooltip. 3. After a few moments the tooltip actually disappears, but you dropped it off to the side first then moved it again to where you wanted it to be. Actual Results: You can quickly grab a favicon image from the address bar and drag it across several monitors in a split second, and this tool tip will still rear it's ugly little verification message. While it does go away after a few seconds, it still denies you the satisfaction of quickly dragging a page you want to bookmark from the address bar to any folders or space it appears over. Expected Results: This tooltip shouldn't be appearing on a mousedown or drag event. Understandably it should be there when a user hovers over, but once selected it should run and hide. I hate you, tool tip.</description>

When I pressed submit I got a message that the service was unavailable. I pressed the back button hoping to copy and paste the question into a text app to save for later. However the text was gone. It would be nice if Firefox could hold on to text box contents when the back button is pressed regardless of what the server does. Imagine typing a long bug report here and losing it all because bugzilla had a problem. Bugzilla probably doesn't behave so badly but some websites do. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Log into https://my3.three.co.uk with a 3-mobile account 2. Go to Contact form and try and contact them 3. Press Submit and get told the service is unavailable right now 4. Press Back button Actual Results: All fields now blank Expected Results: Fields still have the text in them Hold onto what people type into text boxes with grim determination.</description>

It is a great browser. My computer knowledge is limited as far as programing. The main problem I have is that Mozilla-Firefox makes no provision for creating "internet shortcut" for my computer. I have Windows Vista and in order to create a "shortcut" I use their program. However, I have to manually type in the address because I do not use an Internet Explorer based browser; this is consuming and often mistakes are made. Could a plug-in, or navigation tool, or something be created for such. A tip for users: Once "internet shortcut" is created a "folder" can be created for similar sites to eliminate clutter on display. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

      <title>Toolbars in Full Screen should hover over the page content in auto-hide mode.</title>

While normally not a big issue some sites (especially modern RIA web applications) process this resizing with heavy operations, especially since the default behavior is animated 1 second display/hide, which leads to numerous resizings It would be better if the tool-bars would hover above the page content partially hiding the top-part of the page, which is reasonable. This would make modern web-based RIA applications perform better in full-screen. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open a modern RIA framework demonstration, such as http://www.smartclient.com/smartgwt/showcase/. 2. Switch to full screen with default settings (auto-hide over 1 second) 3. Point to the top screen edge to display the tool-bars. Actual Results: The tool-bar shows, the page gets resized, with a very choppy animation. Expected Results: The tool-bars should float-in hovering over the page without any visual changes in the page. This behavior should be changeable by the user, at least with a preference item.</description>

      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.0.5) Gecko/2008120122 Firefox/3.0.5 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729) Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.0.5) Gecko/2008120122 Firefox/3.0.5 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729) Firefox does not allow exe files to be directly run. This is a design flaw. It should be an option because: -normal (secure) internet use often involves downloading a lot of exe files -if there is an option to open an exe file clicked on, then it is run in one click -without this option, it takes 7 to 10 mouse clicks: click on exe, select open, navigate to place to be saved, click OK, double click on file, right click on file, select delete, possible click ok on delete confirmation dialog -the extra clicks are not at the same time (before and after waiting for download, before and after running of file) -Internet Explorer has this option and that makes it more function in this respect. The IE team decided that it was not necessary to remove this feature for security and the proportion of at risk non-technical users is lower for Firefox than IE. -It is not a security problem because if people click on an exe file and download it they will almost always still run it. It just annoys users. -If Firefox developers running exes easily a security issue it should be off by default but enabled by a user setting. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.Navigate to a page with an exe installer file. 2.Click on the exe file. 3. Actual Results: There is the option to save the file but not to run it. Expected Results: There should be both the option to save the file and the option to run it.</description>

Firefox seems to ignore this value -- making it an accessibility issue. I make my scrollbar wide enough to be easily used as I have repetitive stress injuries that make exact cathing of the scroll bar difficult -- __considering how often I use it__. It's about half the width of what I specify in other applications -- or about the same width as the window-decor buttons. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Use windows properties to set the scrollbar width and window-button width to, say 30 pixels (to make it obvious). 2. Notice Firefox (probably Thunderbird too), completely ignores the value and puts up a scroll bar about 15 pixels wide. 3. Actual Results: scroll bar too narrow Expected Results: Scrollbar width to be consistent with OS setting to allow users to specify larger scrollbars for accessibility.</description>

Flash videos should continue on as before. A way to do this would be to decouple the page layout/rendering from the actual display of the tab or window or whatever. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open a web page with a flash video with more than one tab open. 2. Start the video playing 3. Right click on the opened page and select "Move to New Window" or press Ctrl+Alt+T. Actual Results: See that the moved tab stops the video because flash thinks it's a newly loaded page. Expected Results: I would expect the flash video to continue playing as if nothing happened. (we aren't really supposed to be making a new/duplicate page) Display in a tab/window should be not be referenced to the actual window it's in and instead be movable from window to window.</description>

      <title>Enhancement: Include DNS test in diagnostic tests section of Page Load Error/troubleshooting message</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.5) Gecko/2008120122 Firefox/3.0.5 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.5) Gecko/2008120122 Firefox/3.0.5 The Troubleshooting Tools buttons added in FF3 are nice. I think an additional test for DNS problems should be included, indicating (a) whether DNS responded or not and (b) what the response was (ie. either the resolved IP or the error message returned) Many OS's and applications respond to DNS failures in strange ways that don't intuitively point the user to a problem with DNS... often firefox will just hang until DNS times out and give you an Address Not Found error. In other situations, the URL may resolved from a local cache, but if DNS has recently gone down subsequent lookups needed to render the main will timeout but not result in an Address Not Found error. It would be nice to know if this was because the server failed to resolve the addr (and why!), or if the DNS server didn't even respond. If it's the latter, it could be for a variety of reasons, but at least you have a better idea of where the problem lies. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3. Expected Results: An new "DNS" button among the other diagnostic tools buttons ("Ping Server", "Retry This", "Trace to Server", etc.). When clicked, a DNS request for the the host named in the URL would be sent (bypassing local cache), and the results would be shown, including DNS server name/IP, main result (eg. timeout, error, success), the IP address of the target host or the error message received from the DNS server (plus anything else that might be useful, such as a layman's interpretation and suggestions of what to do in each case.)</description>

      <title>Please, add options to sort tabs (alphabetically, by open date, by file date, etc. all classic options)</title>

I would love to right click a tab, and choose "Sort&gt;Alphabetically", or "Sort&gt;By Web domain", or "Sort&gt;By mother before children clicked" Please, add it! Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open many web pages with control clicking on links 2. Read one web page until all other tabs stop loading/working. 3. Try to find the pages related to one you ended reading. Actual Results: You need to search lots of pages. The "list all tabs" button on the right, makes the task easier, but anyway you can't find easily the related pages, specially when the web pages writer does not maintained a name convention. Expected Results: I expect, for example, opening a large article separated in many pages, it haves links (like an index) to each page, so I press control, and click on all the links (to save time). I do the same with many root pages. Then I expect it to be sorted to do not need to search what page is next after one are reading. Many times, I save pages on disk, to read offline, then open all of them, and they are opened randomly. The I lost lot of time sorting the tabs before reading them.</description>

      <title>completely different behavior regarding certificates and trust</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; de-DE; rv:1.9.0.4) Gecko/2008111317 Ubuntu/8.04 (hardy) Firefox/3.0.4 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; de-DE; rv:1.9.0.4) Gecko/2008111317 Ubuntu/8.04 (hardy) Firefox/3.0.4 A radical change in how the browser handles ssl-certificates, connections to ssl-enabled sites and how the concept of trust in general should be handled and communicated to the user Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Try to visit a Website with a self-signed or otherwise unknown certificate Actual Results: It will throw a bunch of error messages at me suggesting that the site is insecure and the owner of that site is somewhere between non-serious and criminal. Expected Results: Let me surf the site without *any* modal warnings at all just as it would let me visit a http site without warnings as long as it doesn't detect a *change* of the certificate from remembered previous visits or an invalidity of the certificate itself. Treat sites with new untrusted certificates exactly like http sites because they are in no way less insecue than http sites. As you might already know, the whole certificate trust model used in web browsers today was rendered completely useless, publicly announced yesterday afternoon (30.12.2008, 15:15 MEZ at the 25c3 in Berlin) I want to propose the following new and radically different behavior regarding the handling of ssl-enabled websites, certificates and trust and trustworthiness and the communication of the underlying concepts and relationships via the UI and its behavior in their very natural meaning, stop calling built-in certificate chains trustworthy (because they obviously are not) and instead of making any usage of this disfunctinal automatic trust-machine give the user exactly two choices: Explicitely trust a given certificate by his very own will or just do nothing and treat the site like any other untrustworty site and let him use the site like he would use just any other http site. The new behavior would basically be the folloing: * The certificate store initially is completely empty, consequently NO built-in root CAs at all. * use any unknown https sites just like if they were http sites, don't pop up any warnings because although there there is no evidence that the site is valid there is also no evidence that the site is forged. I fact there is no evidence for anything at all, just like it is the case with http. So treat it like http. * store the hashes of seen certificates with the domain names they belong to somewhere to be able to detect sudden changes. * If a previosly visited site changes its certificate pop up a modal warning that explains this fact in clear understandable words. * If the certificate is invalid (expiration, domain name) pop up a modal warning that explains the fact in clear understandable words. * Dont put any possible interpretations or wild speculations into the warning messages, they are most likely wrong and misleading, just write the hard facts in clear and understandable words, the user will be able to draw his own conclusions if he is confronted with hard facts instead of wild speculations. * allow the user to OPTIONALLY trust the identity of a certain certificate, not to circumvent any error messages as it is now but to gain additional security if he WANTS it. This will keep the number of certificates in the certificate store very small and the average user will now for the first time in is life have a chance to finally understand whats going on there and what this is all about. * Prominently give trusted sites a different appearance in the address bar, but only distinguish between normal sites (http and https) and trusted sites (manually trusted cert) and nothing else.</description>

This applies for an HTTPS server that requires basic authentication for all pages. The login-failed content behind the basic-authentication headers is an immediate redirect to a non-SSL page. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Go to a secure server set up as in the description. 2. The user is shown an HTTP basic authentication dialog. 3. The user wants to check the SSL certificate before handing over the valuable password, but this is not shown and the familiar padlock status bar isn't present. 4. The user hits cancel, or deliberately fails login. The browser is then redirected to the non-SSL page before they get a chance to click on the padlock icon. Actual Results: No opportunity to inspect the SSL certificate before handing over a valuable password. Expected Results: Clickable padlock icon while HTTP authenticate dialog is shown.</description>

SO th euser can customize other peoples web page. So for example you open a page at microsoft, you can configure the browser to insert a java frowning face every time you load that page. Also great to insert gadgets, stock charts, etc. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

So i think the only real usable thing in the skipper is the new "v" which lists the past and following sites perfectly - good work! Could you please enable a second toolbar element just with this "v" one for users who want to easily skip back and forward with their mouse or keyboard and just need the small button sometimes when they jump across a big couple of pages, maybe in social websites when browsed through a big picture gallery and want to return to the profile now without seeing every picture once more?

Right now, if I go to a site, and someone manages to get a certificate for that site (see http://blog.startcom.org/?p=145 or https://events.ccc.de/2008/12/30/the-cat-is-out-of-the-bag/ for examples) and pulls a man-in-the-middle attack on me, I don't find out. I want mozilla to tell me and NOT send any data to the site before I approve. I realize this would yield false positives when the certificate is renewed, but mozilla could detect that and warn in friendly colors that the old certificate has expired in the mean time and it's probably OK. This is a really important UI thing to have, even if you disable it by default. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

      <title>Add "since Firefox was opened" to clear recent history timeframe dropdown</title>
      <description>In the dropdown to specify the range for tools -&gt; clear recent history, we currently have 4 time ranges (1, 2, 4, &amp; today) and everything. A fairly simple use of this feature would be to wipe everything that was just done recently. Instead of only letting users decide this via a fixed time range I would like the option to clear everything for this current session. (just get the app uptime and sanitize back to that) This would be much simpler and require no guessing of times on the part of users. An example of a possible accident this resists: open Firefox, do something for 61 minutes, clear last hour -&gt; missed first min vs. open Firefox, do something for 61 minutes, clear session -&gt; nothing missed also see bug 464588</description>

Please make it fill the size of the window instead of being stuck at some fixed size... Also related, maybe this should be a new bug, but when I have that many things open the scrollbar's thumb is really really hard to grab (Mac OS X). It's weird because it is not physically small, but it responds to clicks as if it's only a pixel or two high. Click too high or too low and it jumps up/down a page instead of grabbing and letting me scroll. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open a billion windows 2. Force quit firefox. 3. Restart Actual Results: Tiny list area that doesn't resize with the window. Expected Results: Nice big list area that resizes with the window.</description>

However, because these sites are also bookmarks I cannot remove them from my search results without removing the bookmark even though Firefox is not searching my bookmarks. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Set the following in about:config places.frecency.bookmarkVisitBonus = 0 places.frecency.unvisitedBookmarkBonus = 0 browser.urlbar.matchOnlyTyped = True 2. Type text to find a bookmarked visited URL 3. Highlight the result 4. Hit DEL or shift-DEL to delete 5. Re-enter the text from step 2 Actual Results: The result reappears due to the fact that it is also a bookmark Expected Results: The result should not reappear since I don't care to search by bookmarks and if I want to delete something from my history I shouldn't have to delete the associated bookmark first. Would it be possible to allow deletion from the Location Bar results without deleting the bookmark, either 1) when the above config settings above are set or 2) generally? The workaround of deleting a bookmark is not desirable in most cases.</description>

In Firefox, if there are any tabs to the right of the current tab, the new tab will be created all the way to the right. In Chrome, IE7 and Opera it will be opened next to the current tab. I like it a lot more the way Chrome, IE7 and Opera does this. I have most of the time a lot of tabs, often more tabs that fit in the browser window... So I have to scroll in the tabs to get to those all the way to the right. When I'm in a tab (page) and right click a link, or I'm in my yahoo mail and click a link, and the link opens in a new tab, then I want it to open next to my current tab. That way I will have my tabs more organized, and it will be more intuitive and logical if the "Go to tab after it is opened" is active. Just my 100 cent.

These pages do not need tabs taking up the limited tab real estate. I propose a feature where tabs are able to be "hidden", remaining available only by the Tab drop down or maybe by a task bar "minimised" icon. If I quit a browser with minimised tabs it would be good to be offered the options: 1: Quit and save 2: Quit UI but leave hidden tabs running 3: Quit That way if I want to continue being alerted option 2 could just minimise the browser UI to an icon in the task bar or something.

I'm lazy, and don't navigate back to existing tabs, and instead, I just open a new tab, and open the URL I want in the new tab. When I do this, I'd rather the browser just bring the tab already on said URL, to the foreground. This will prevent me from opening many tabs on the same page. Workflow: 1. in tab1 goto www.cnn.com 2. in tab2 goto www.whatever.com 3. in tab3 goto www.there.com 4. in tab4 goto www.cnn.com 5. after hitting enter on #4's www.cnn.com, the browser should close tab4 and just bring tab1 to the foreground.

      <title>"Remember Passwords" window (for saved passwords) should support filter by site (including partial match)</title>

This is due to variances of the inclusion of (and flavor of) the protocol (http:// https://), and of the "www.", or "secure." or other, before the 2nd-level domain name. . It would be very helpful if the user could filter these based on a partial match of the "site" displayed. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Have a large list of saved passwords, for many different web sites, such that: a. the site names recorded vary by starting with http://, https://, and lacking such a prefix; b. the site names recorded include various 3rd-level domains ("www.", "secure.", etc.) and some exclude them 2. Have a user unfamiliar with the data search for the username for several random sites, using their "common" name (americanexpress.com, etc.) Expected Results: If there were a filter available, the user could type only the 2nd-level domain name, wait a moment, and for typical use cases, would be presented with a filtered list just a few entries long.</description>

      <title>Method to easily to change the displayed order of toolbars</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.5) Gecko/2008120122 Firefox/3.0.5 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.5) Gecko/2008120122 Firefox/3.0.5 Firefox is wonderful by being able to customize it. However, the management of toolbars is very lacking. Especially in being able to rename, delete, or change the order that toolbars are displayed. When you add a new toolbar it is always added to the bottom. I propose that an enhancement be made to the "Customize Toolbar" dialog window by removing the "Add New Toolbar" button and replacing it with a "Manage Toolbar" button. Upon pressing the "Manage Toolbar" dialog window would appear with a scrollable list of toolbars on the left, Five buttons on the right. "Move Up", "Move Down", "Add New Toolbar", "Rename Toolbar", and "Delete Toolbar". Two button on the bottom of the window "OK" and "Cancel" After highlighting a toolbar in the list, a person could click the "Move Up" or the "Move Down" to move the toolbar in the list. Clicking on "Add Toolbar" would open a dialog box below the highlighted toolbar to allow the user to enter the name. Clicking the "Rename Toolbar" button would present a dialog box that would the user to rename the highlighted toolbar. Clicking on "Delete Toolbar" button would remove the highlighted toolbar. Clicking on the "oK" button would commit the changes, exit, and prompt for restart. clicking on the "Cancel" button would discard the changes and exit. Of course the "Menu", "Navigation", "Bookmarks", and "Tab" toolbars would be "grayed out" in the list as they are system toolbars that shouldn't be changed. Also when Toolbars that are installed through add-ons are highlighted, the "Delete Toolbar" button would be grayed out. This enhancement would go a long way towards making toolbars much more "customizable". I'm not sure, but I don't think an add-on could perform this enhancement. That's why I'm submitting it to Bugzilla. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3. From what I have read and experienced. Adding toolbars is pretty straight forward except the toolbar must have something in it or it is deleted. To delete toolbars you must remove all the items on it. To reorder or rename toolbars you must manually make changes to the profile files (not very well documented). These methods are not very "user friendly" They are time consuming and possibly dangerous.</description>

All windows get hidden for a while until a new window with the private browsing start page opens. It works fine the other way around. Leaving PB mode there is a seamless transition. Safari which also has the PB mode included does it in a nice seamless way. There is no flickering visible at all. We should probably do the same. The currently active window shouldn't be closed. Ehsan, I did a search on Bugzilla but haven't found anything about that high visual behavior. Why that wasn't covered already? No idea, if this qualifies for a blocker but lets try.</description>

Perhaps the thumbnails could be pre-rendered after the browser finishes downloading all currently downloading tabs? Of course, there is a CPU and memory cost there... 2) The thumbnails are very large, but there are always 9 of them (or positions for 9). If more than 9 tabs are open, additional tabs can be accessed by clicking on a dot in a sort of iPhone-like interface. But this is much slower than having an overview of all tabs, or having a list. This could be improved by creating smaller thumbnails, but having a thumbnail for each page. 3) A separate button for the tab list and the thumbnails would be really useful. Sometimes titles in a list would be the best way to find something. Sometimes, thumbnails would be. 4) The translucent background takes up a HUGE amount of screen space (about 1920x1200 on a 2560x1600 display). Why? 5) Most thumbnails show the top left corner of the open web page (or at least the top left corner of the currently open view), at what looks like 50% scale. Unfortunately, it can be hard to tell what the page shows from that context, because most of the page is clipped out. An easier to navigate view might be one that shows the entire page in a smaller thumbnail (see iPhone for a good example). You get much more context from the whole page than from a few words clipped from a larger view. 6) Thumbnails appearing above tabs might be very useful. :-) Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: N/A</description>

Firefox remembers what tabs it has open, which mostly restores the previous state of the browser. But if you have browser windows open on multiple virtual desktops, you currently have to manually figure out which one went where and place them back where they were before.

Sometimes, bookmarks in a folder can be "weakly categorized". It may not be strong enough to create a separate folder, but yet it's not weak enough to just put it together without separating. Or there're sites that belongs to both weak categories. Now, being able to see the label of separators in the bookmark list under bookmark menu allows users to quickly identify what's under a separator. I notice that the ability to edit separator labels is actually gone for FF3.1. But I also see bugs comments about retargetting to 3.2. So I assume this enhancement can still be valid.

      <title>Web page bookmark opening a sidebar should give the sidebar focus</title>
      <description>Because window.focus() is unspecified and found annoying, the application (the browser) should be responsible for making the sidebar content focused when user open it by clicking a bookmark set to open in a sidebar. The same is made for any browser (Firefox) sidebar, such as history or bookmarks. If this is not possible, it would be great to have some workaround for web application to make the sidebar focused them self.</description>

Firefox currently has a warning when "I submit information that's not encrypted," but it is of limited usefulness because it's disabled by default and is burdensome when it is enabled because of the large number of false positives. The proposed warning would hopefully have far fewer false positives and could be enabled by default. Reproducible: Always</description>

I would like to see an option to delete feeds from the live bookmarks, as this will increase the chances of the user discovering a new feed within a live bookmark. Large feed lists make discovering a new feed almost impossible, especially with no particular way to delete them. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.Click on Bookmarks in the top menu 2.Hold mouse cursor over live bookmarks 3.Right click on a feed - no option to delete Actual Results: Without an option to delete the feeds, the feed list become larger, and makes discovery of a new feed more difficult. Expected Results: Allow an option to delete feeds.</description>

      <description>The equivalent UI in desktop firefox actually serves two purposes -- first, it indicateds that one or multiple feeds are available, and, second, it provides a mechanism by which the user can subscribe to the feed of his or her choice. Both of these are represented by the RSS icon in the URL bar. In fennec, we can provide both through use of an extended site identity button (parallel with search plugins in bug 477620).

(LD_PRELOAD patching) Is there any chance Firefox could gain a pair of preferences which, if set, let you specify commands like `kdialog --getopenfilename $STARTDIR $FILTER` and `kdialog --getsavefilename $STARTDIR` to override the default file picker? Both example commands return the filename via their stdout or a nonzero exit code to indicate cancellation and they can always be wrapped by shell scripts to convert argument formats if need be. ($FILTER is a space-separated list of mimetypes) That'd be hacky enough to justify never having to support KDE dialogs, but it'd still assuage people like me who just want their systems to be comfortable and it'd provide a low-effort way for integrators to support KDE dialogs. There is partial precedent in the print.print_command preference. Reproducible: Always</description>

      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.0.5) Gecko/2009010511 Gentoo Firefox/3.0.5 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.0.5) Gecko/2009010511 Gentoo Firefox/3.0.5 bzip2 has become a compression format with nearly as much support and common use as gzip, but with a significantly higher compression ratio. High compression ratios save bandwidth costs which benefits everybody. If I visit a URL protocol://foo.bar/document.html.bz2, I would like Firefox to transparently decompress the file and display the HTML, just as it does currently for gzip. It seems like there would be a few pieces to this: 1) Allow "bzip2" in the Accept-Encoding: header and recognize the equivalent response from the server. 2) Recognize a something/x-bzip2 mime-type or something along those lines 3) Recognize the .bz2 extension, especially for protocols such as file:/ where there are no headers and metadata. Of the above, 1) and 2) might be more involved since they involve headers and mime types and may need coordination with server vendors or standards committees. However #3 could be implemented in Firefox and be immediately useful without bothering anyone else to support it. #3 alone would still be very useful. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: Visit any text or HTML URL that ends in .bz2 You probably already have one on your local disk that you could access with a file:// URL Actual Results: Vising a *.html.bz2 URL either opens a download popup, or displays compressed binary garbage. Expected Results: Would like to see the contents of *.html (or *.txt, or any other displayable file format) after bzip2 decompression</description>

      <title>Cookie whitelist does not protect cookies from some forms of automatic deletion</title>

However doing this requires I have to log back into facebook and reset other cookies that I didn't particular want to clear. I suggest implementing a list of perma-cookies that allow for certain cookies to be kept by default (unless you tick the clear perma-cookies box in delete private info). Why not simply use the white list that already exists, I hear you cry. Well that means a major inconvenience whenever I visit other sites that require cookies to use. I have to manually add these sites of the list or disable my preferences. A list of perma cookies would allow for this as it doesn't affect day to day cookie collecting Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Get annoyed at loads of cookies 2. Clear cookies 3. Get annoyed at useful cookies being cleared</description>

      <title>Modifier+Enter URI "fixup" can not be disabled by preferences</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.0.6) Gecko/2009011912 Firefox/3.0.6 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.0.6) Gecko/2009011912 Firefox/3.0.6 When entering a keyword, the "feature" that prefixes and suffixes the word with modifier keys+enter cannot be permanently disabled by preferences. As a normal user, I don't want the program changing what I type. If I wanted to type www.whatever.com I would have done so. The shift key is right next to the Enter key, and even as a somewhat accomplished typist, I hit it quite often. Yes, I could use the "URL Suffix" add-on, or change the js chrome (I've done both...every update breaks the chrome tweak, and 3.0 broke URL Suffix long enough for it to be disabled), but this should EASILY be a user selectable setting (and I would argue bitterly one which should be turned off by default). I'll be good and submit this as an enhancement, even though I consider it a huge flaw. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1.Enable keywords 2.Type keyword(s) 3.Accidentally press shift-enter (or ctrl-enter or alt-enter [on windows]) Actual Results: Firefox prepends http://www. and appends .com (or .net or .org) to the word(s) Expected Results: Either allow this to be disabled by about:config, or don't prepend http://www. and append .com (or .net or .org) to the word(s) at all.</description>

      <title>restoring tabs behind a redirecting hotspot loads x identical tabs</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9.0.6) Gecko/2009020911 Ubuntu/8.10 (intrepid) Firefox/3.0.6 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9.0.6) Gecko/2009020911 Ubuntu/8.10 (intrepid) Firefox/3.0.6 If you open firefox to restore many tabs, as you would when starting up a laptop, and you are behind a hotspot that requires login, all the tabs will load, and each one will ask you to log in. HTTPS sites will complain about invalid certs. You proceed to log in, and each tab is still pointed towards the redirected login page. Sometimes, reloading all tabs will fix, depending on the hotspot. (Some use orriginating website URL in the GET) Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Have multiple tabs open 2. Crash firefox (kill process) 3. Log out of authentication session behind a hotspot. (Cycle power to wireless adapter) 4. Restart Firefox and restore tabs. Actual Results: Each tab loads the login screen. HTTPS sites complain about cert. Expected Results: There should be a UI that informs the user of limited connectivity. The user should have the option of logging in first, then loading the tabs and windows from the previous session. This will require testing the connection to the internet. This is not a trivial task as simple methods only test for connection to any network. A system similar to phishing detection where high-availability servers are tested may provide this.</description>

Sometimes the indication even disappears. Also the items count summary at the bottom should make things clear, especially when/whether subfolders are included. When subfolders are included the the second line would also be shown. 3 folders, 29 non folders in selected folder 13 folders, 839 non folders in selected folder and subfolders The current summary would show 32 items, I expect that after bug 451151 is fixed it would show 852 (either way you would not know how many are bookmarks) Unless you display the "Parent folder" column in the library listing it is very difficult to tell what you are actually finding. "Show Parent Folder" - https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/7372 Reproducible: Always bug 451151 attempts to resolve scope of search, but don't think it would provide user with information about the actual scope of the search. There is no F1 - Help so no way to even see what the intent is. User may want to search only the selected folder, or may want to selected folder and all subfolders.</description>

I've been debugging code with both user-driven and timer-driven events. To see which activity causes which error I need to watch the error console all the time (but I'm usually watching my application). Time stamps in the records would (in many cases) show which events were connected to each other as well as which were caused by user activity and which were caused by timers. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. View several typical (aka broken) web pages. 2. Look at the error console. Actual Results: Notice that you can't tell which errors happened at the same time and when there were time gaps. Expected Results: Time stamps in each line to give some indication of which events are related.</description>

For example, the input widgets could be "embedded" into the 'Bookmarks Toolbar'. Reproducible: Always</description>

      <title>Change browser.identity.ssl_domain_display pref default to 1</title>
      <description>Created attachment 364344 [details] [diff] [review] pref change The positive indications of SSL are too subtle in the non-EV case, we need to change the default pref browser.identity.ssl_domain_display to the value "1". This bug is not about improving SSL indication in general, that debate is carried on elsewhere (newsgroups, bug 430790). This is not even a bug to debate this change; that, too, has already taken place elsewhere. This bug is strictly a placeholder for the mechanical code change described in the summary, to be approved or not. If people are worried about the redundancy of having SSL indicators also appear in the status bar they should file a separate bug to remove the status bar info. Burying the SSL indicator in the easily-missed status bar was already acknowledged as a problem when Firefox made the much-lauded change to add SSL indication to the url bar (adding the lock and yellow highlight). That was the right move, we should not regress. Whether or not we keep the status bar info for lock fetishists is separate from this bug about improving SSL discovery in the location-bar area where people are looking.</description>

(https://cert.startcom.org/ for example, for free) I do not necessarily believe this is broken, and use Perspectives and did not like firefox 3's security dialogs, but I think that it is important to seperate validation of domain name and validation of persona. Also, although i see it is a problem with phishing, I dont have a huge problem seeing a site that isnt verified, thats what https does all the time, and simply making a https connection does not have to mean i need security. (I think firefox should just remove the padlock, and do a big red slash on https://) But it is an issue if information is sent to that site, for example cookies. There could be two levels) 1) if the ssl key changes at all have a warning and/or void cookies. (and never send cookies without some recognition by users) -- This is SSH paranoid mode, which would trigger even when a site updates its time-limited certificate. 2) invalidate cookies and/or warn user if the new certificate deletes or changes the Organization field (O) in the certificate, and/or if the certificate signer is differn't than the last certificate. -- trusted certificates that have something misleading in the O field would be very hard to get, even if DNS was compromised, and a disappearing O field could mean something, as non-identifying certificates (besides domain) are easy to get. current) what is currently in place: if the certificate is good for the domain, trust it absolutely. stealing cookies with redirection is not unheard of (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pirate_Bay#Blocking). Of course this fix would not work with http, and it might be better to give the site a cookie than have users log in (although important sites wont trust a cookie over more than one session) Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: Fairily trivial with http 1.Go to a site that sets a cookie 2.have your dns spoofed by any upstream dns provider (or your ip rerouted) 3.have new site get your cookie and appear as the new one. with https considerably harded as requires controling real DNS 1)set mail server to attackers control 2)validate postmaster@domain.tld with StartCom 3)redirect users 4)get cookie, impersonate, etc, even though now the site does not have any Organization validation it may have had, is probably certified by a different certifier, etc. I think firefox lets users know what is going on really well if you click on the "more information" in the identity box. But: cookies should perhaps not carry over immediately, and have a better way of knowing when signers of certificates, and actual certificates, change. DNSSEC will largely break the attack vector, but that would still be possibly vulnerable redirections or The Pirate Bay's type.</description>
