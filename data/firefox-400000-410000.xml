      <title>Adapt Web Feed preview page for Podcasts and Video Podcasts</title>
      <description>If an RSS feed is determined to be a podcast or video podcast (bug #400062), we need to adapt the feed preview page: -change the icon -change the descriptive text -change the set of available applications (needs to be the same set as what is listed in the applications prefpane)</description>

Often, I will have 20 windows open (and a couple tabs in some), and my cpu will be at 50%, my processor fan spinning up to full blast. Everything in ffox slows down. And then I close one particular window and all of a sudden everything is calm and smooth. I presently have no way to determine which window/tab/page is the hog, besides manually closing every one (and then reopening it if it's not the problem window). I have asked some extension developers who tell me this is too low-level for them to do, hence I'm here. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: this is not applicable</description>

Since the Windows firefox.exe is already signed, it would make sense to sing firefox.app too (and thunderbird.app, but I'm to lazy to file another bug) From the URL: "Signed Applications Feel safe with your applications.

      <title>reduce redundancy in file of ignored leak stacks</title>
      <description>The "ignored" file of known leak stacks has much unhelpful redundancy. Ideally it would contain one line per conceptual leak. When that one leak is fixed, that one line would be removed. But today it contains many lines for a single conceptual leak. I want to eliminate the redundancy and reduce the file size, approaching the lower bound of one line per conceptual leak. There are (at least) two reasons for this redundancy. 1) compound objects generate multiple stacks when leaked. Consider an object like a PRLock or a PKIX object, which contain several parts, each of which is separately allocated. When a single PRLock or single PKIX object is leaked, all the indivudual parts of the object are leaked, each with a separate stack. But the leak is really of a single compound object, and when it is fixed, all the stacks for all the parts of it will go away. So, I changed the stacks for compound objects. For example, I changed all the stacks that leak PRLocks, so that PR_NewLock/** is the last thing that appears on the line, then eliminated duplicate lines. That eliminated MANY redundant lines. 2) Some functions always leak, no matter how they are called, nor in which program they are called. If they are called in many paths, in many programs, they generate many leak stacks. But when the leaky function is fixed, all the stacks that call it will go away. I identified numerous leaky functions, such as cert_VerifyCertChainPkix that appear in many different call stacks, and changed all those stacks to begin with **/cert_VerifyCertChainPkix then eliminated duplicate lines from the file. This removed many redundant lines. The result of those changes is the patch attached here. After I made all these changes, I noticed one more thing that I want to ask about. There are many stacks that appear twice, whose only difference is the presence of the _Util suffix in one stack, e.g. these two ocspclnt/main/CERT_SetOCSPDefaultResponder/PORT_Strdup/** ocspclnt/main/CERT_SetOCSPDefaultResponder/PORT_Strdup_Util/** Do both of these stacks occur on the trunk? Or does this one file contain both trunk stacks and branch stacks? I don't want branch-only stacks on the trunk's ignored file, nor trunk-only stacks in the branch's ignored file. I invite comments from you all. Slavo, please review and ensure that lines with "**" in the middle will work, e.g. strsclnt/**/thread_wrapper/do_connects/PR_Send (...)</description>

There is an option for a one-shot ICS file publishing from the local calendar. Would it be possible to make an option for auto-republishing the calendar ICS file to a web share (like www.icalx.com or FTP) in certain intervals or better after each change in the local calendar?

      <title>The Administration link should open a menu with links to separate admin pages</title>
      <description>When hovering the Admistration page in the footer/header of pages, I would like to see a menu with "Products, Parameters, Users, ...". This would let us save a click and more easily administrate Bugzilla. I'm not asking for the removal of the Administration link! We replaced all the previous administrative links by this single link on purpose (we don't administrate Bugzilla that often and all the links take a lot of place). But saving one click is nice too.</description>

      <title>Specialized GC arena for double values</title>
      <description>Currently GC to allocate double values uses a common GC arena structure. This is inefficient for the following reasons. 1. Since the minimal allocation cell for GC arena is 2 CPU words, this allocates almost twice memory then necessary on 64 bit CPU. 2. It adds the finalization phase for double values. Such phase is not necessary since the double values do not have a finalizer. As such it should be possible to discover free double cells during the allocation. 3. It uses one byte of GC flags per jsdouble when with a specialized arena only the single bit to denote marked/used double cell is necessary. 4. A specialized GC arena should allow to minimize the number of ifs taken during the allocation and speed-up numerically-intensive scripts. Thus it would nice to support such specialized GC arena for double values.</description>

      <title>Want exported function that outputs all host names for DNS name matching</title>
      <description>I'd like PSM to extract the list of valid DNS names from a cert. Bob R pointed out, this requires the use of CERT_FindNSStringExtension(nssCert, SEC_OID_NS_CERT_EXT_SSL_SERVER_NAME); which can override the name found in a cert's CN. Unfortunately CERT_FindNSStringExtension is not being exported. Can we do that for 3.12?</description>

      <title>Enable predefined  IMAP settings for Gmail</title>
      <description>IMAP is now enabled for Gmail. Actually when you add a new account it's possible to select Gmail but all predefined settings are for POP access. If I want to add IMAP access I need to go through 'Email account' Steps to reproduce: 1 Enable IMAP in your Gmail account. 2 Open Thunderbird, and select Tools &gt; Account Settings. 3 Click Add Account. 4 Select the Email account radio button and click Next. The Identity screen appears. 5 Enter your full name in the Your Name field. Enter your full Gmail email address (username@gmail.com) in the Email Address field, and click Next. 6 Select IMAP as the type of incoming server you are using. Enter imap.gmail.com in the Incoming Server field. etc. Expected result: Just select Tools &gt; Account Settings &gt; Add Account &gt; Gmail and then select IMAP or POP access</description>

      <title>Build Lightning with Sunbird</title>
      <description>Although building lightning with sunbird per --enable-extension works well for me, it seems not to be the way how we build lightning in the tinderboxen: lightning's mozconfigs are based on thunderbird. Grepping thru the calendar tree for MOZ_SUNBIRD, it shows we've some places where we distinct lightning from sunbird by build variable (not dynamically). MOZ_SUNBIRD: 8:#ifdef MOZ_SUNBIRD ./locales/jar.mn 64:ifdef MOZ_SUNBIRD ./locales/Makefile.in 185:RCFLAGS += -DMOZ_SUNBIRD -I$(srcdir) 187:RCFLAGS += -DMOZ_SUNBIRD --include-dir $(srcdir) 203:RCFLAGS += -DMOZ_SUNBIRD ./sunbird/app/Makefile.in This bug should clarify what's missing to safely build lightning with sunbird.</description>

      <title>missing "Text Size" zoom feature, Full page zoom should be an option not replacement</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; ru; rv:1.8.1.8) Gecko/20071008 Firefox/2.0.0.8 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; ru; rv:1.8.1.8) Gecko/20071008 Firefox/2.0.0.8 As we can see in the latest trunk (Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9a9pre) Gecko/2007102605 Minefield/3.0a9pre), text size zoom is replaced with full page zoom, and there is no way to return usual text size zoom. But for many people (including yours faithfully) full page zoom is completely useless and moreover UNUSABLE. It's even often is one of reasons for people to prefer Firefox to Opera -- they just want to increase text size -- not images, not layout at all, text only -- for more comfortable READING only, not for any another purposes. Text size zoom is really advantageous distinction of Firefox from any other browser. So, if full page zoom will be turned on by default then an option to return old behavior should exist. (Though, in my humble opinion, expediency of turning full page zoom by default is VERY questionable, and ZOOM should be an option [for some Opera switchers, etc.] -- and text size turned on by default as it was in previous Firefox versions). Subject options, for example, may look like two radiobuttons in "View" -&gt; "Zoom" menu: - Zoom text only - Zoom full page with former option checked by default. This may be duplicated in hierarchy of main Firefox settings if needed (perhaps someplace in "Tools" -&gt; "Options" -&gt; "Content"). Thanks. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: Just try to resize text only -- you will get full page zoom instead. Then search for option to return old behavior -- there is nothing ways to do it. Actual Results: Text size zoom is replaced with full page zoom. Expected Results: Full page zoom should be an option, not default and only way to zoom text.</description>

      <description>when showing autocomplete result, show tags that partially match I was telling dan mills that for autocomplete results, if you have an exact match with a tag, we'll show you the tagged items (at the top of your autocomplete results) here's an idea for an enhancement: when typing "fire", if there is no "fire" tag, show an item corresponding to any tags that might match this text as the topmost result, like: "firefly firefox fireman". if you have no tags, you won't see anything. but if you use tags, this might prove a useful way to find tagged items (in case you don't remember what your tags are called.)</description>

      <description>Created attachment 287165 [details] v1 mockup of download summary information in the status bar It would be a useful accompaniment to the Downloads Manager if there were a summary of current download activity in the Firefox statusbar. Clicking on this summary could launch or bring to the foreground the Downloads Manager itself. This area would simply not be present if no download activity were in progress. See the accompanying mockup for an idea of how this could look and work. A note about the mockup: The rolled-up summary "time remaining" would be the greatest time remaining for any individual active (non-paused) download, given that they're happening in parallel.</description>

      <title>Support other message storage formats.  (prelude to pluggable mail stores)</title>
      <description>Per a discussion on IRC (on a weekend, unfortunately), an idea was raised to have pluggable file format supports for message storage. Questions I had: 1. What level should this be? Compile-time, profile, account, or folder ? 2. Which format should be the default? 3. What formats should we support? 4. What scope should we have for choices? Choosing *.msf/*.mab formats as well? jwq's answers: 1. mailbox storage formats should be choosable on a per-account basis at account setup time. In an ideal word, they'd be changeable after this as well. 2. mbox should be the default for the reason set out in &lt;http://www.jwz.org/doc/mailsum.html&gt; and the pro-mbox arguments in Bug 58308 and Bug 361807. Basically, compatibility. 3. We should support whatever we (i.e. you guys :-) ) can code. There are requests for maildir and SQLite db. 4. The .msf format should change with the account choice. The only strong opinion on .mab I have is that it shouldn't be mork.</description>

      <title>Move throbber to where the URL bar site icon (favicon) is.</title>
      <description>Alex, beltzner, and mconnor designed this, I'm summarizing: * Remove the throbber from its current location on the toolbar. * Add throbber to where the favicon is in the URL bar. * The throbber, like the favicon and the URL, is tied to the tab being shown. * While the page is loading, you see the throbber, and when it finishes you get the favicon. [Just like how the throbber/icon on tabs currently works.] Why: * Brings load activity closer to the UI that affects throbbing (eg Stop, enter a URL, forward/back/reload). * A throbber here is useful for indicating activity as a Places search runs (as you're typing in the field) * One less icon in the primary UI (favicon is now overloaded, no standalone throbber) Known nits: * The "inactive throbber" state ceases to exist. [More precisely, a favicon is shown when the throbber is inactive.] This is highly desirable for integration consistency on OS X. * The throbber is no longer global, so if the only tab loading is hidden in tab overflow, there's no at-a-glance activity indication. * The favicon can load before the page is finished loading, but won't be shown until the page finishes loading and the throbber stops. Stalled loads would be the worst example of this. * This could be perceived as a flashing effect, where navigating within a site causes icon --&gt; throbber --&gt; icon --&gt; throbber --&gt; icon, etc. We already flash a little between the site icon and generic icon, although it can be subtle.</description>

      <description>Thunderbird provides some read-only support for Outlook Express and Outlook via hidden LDAP preferences, but it's not very good, and it requires that Outlook is the default mail program, which kind of defeats the purpose. There's a new read-write API to access the Windows Contacts in Windows Vista. It would be great to support that. Also need to consider the preferences UI (see bug 83100).</description>

The method is demonstrated in the contrib/pngminim directory of the libpng distribution. pnggccrd.c and pngvcrd.c are no longer used so they can be removed, and the test compile of pnggccrd.c in configure.in can be eliminated. The defines of MOZ_PNG_READ and MOZ_PNG_WRITE do not need to be global, so they can be defined in the png Makefiles instead of in configure.in, thus simplifying the compile line for all *.c except for those in libpng. The png Makefile can be revised to not compile some files when png does not appear in MOZ_IMG_DECODERS and others when png does not appear in MOZ_IMG_ENCODERS. There's a spelling error ("sais" should be "says") in nsPNGDecoder.cpp .</description>

      <title>Implement scrollIntoViewIfNeeded</title>
      <description>Newer WebKit builds has a very useful method on HTMLElement called: scrollIntoViewIfNeeded(opt_center : boolean) It will scroll an element into view if it is outside the viewport. The param, if true or left out will center the element and if false it will scroll as little as possible to make the element visible in the viewport. This is very similar to scrollIntoView(opt_top) except that it will not scroll any elements if the element is already fully visible in the viewport.</description>

      <title>Implement the TLS session ticket extension (STE)</title>
      <description>Created attachment 288414 [details] [diff] [review] Proposed patch v1 We would like to implement the TLS session ticket extension as specified in the Internet-Draft draft-salowey-tls-rfc4507bis-01.txt. This extension allows session resumption without server-side state. The attached patch is contributed by Nagendra Modadugu of Google. It still needs a little polishing, but I invite you to skim through it and give us early comments. The following known issues are outside the scope of this enhancement request. 1. The server-side key management functions haven't been implemented. 2. If the server is running in the bypassPKCS11 mode, the master secret in the session ticket is unwrapped. Otherwise, the master secret in the session ticket is wrapped. Of course, the session ticket is always encrypted. The session ticket extension is disabled by default. An application needs to set an SSL socket option to enable the session ticket extension. The test programs strsclnt, tstclnt, and selfserv have a new -u command-line option to enable the session ticket extension. I added new SSL stress tests in nss/tests/ssl/sslstress.txt to test stateless resumption using session tickets.</description>

      <title>Replacing js_InternalCall =&gt; js_Invoke in Array.sort implementation</title>
      <description>[This is a spin-off of bug 371636 comment 18.] Currently sort_compare from jsarray.c uses js_InternalCall to invoke the comparator function. This is suboptimal since it adds an overhead of js_AllocStack/js_FreeCall for each compare operation. It would be nice to allocate the stack only once as array_extra implementation does.</description>

There are two things that should be done: ## Provide separate icons in PNG format for the commonly used sizes 16x16, 22x22, 24x24, 32x32 and 48x48. All with nice alpha and AA. Not just scaled down versions but tweaked versions to better fir the smaller sizes. If possible, also provide a scalable version of the logo in SVG format. This would fix the look of the Application launcher in the menu. ## Don't use a fixed size icon for the window icon. The current icon (48x48?) looks very blurry in the window list (scaled down to 16x16) but looks pixelized in window previews, scale and the task switcher.

      <title>Simplifying js_CompileScript/js_CompileFunctionBody invocations</title>
      <description>Currently in all cases js_CompileScript and js_CompileFunctionBody are used like in the following patterns: if (!js_InitParseContext(cx, &amp;pc, NULL, 0, file, filename, 1)) return NULL; js_InitCompilePrincipals(cx, &amp;pc, principals); script = js_CompileScript(cx, obj, &amp;pc); js_FinishParseContext(cx, &amp;pc); and ok = js_InitParseContext(cx, &amp;pc, chars, length, NULL, filename, lineno); if (ok) { js_InitCompilePrincipals(cx, &amp;pc, principals); ok = js_CompileFunctionBody(cx, &amp;pc, fun); js_FinishParseContext(cx, &amp;pc); } For simpler code it would be nice to move the initialization/finishing of the parse context into js_CompileScript and js_CompileFunctionBody themselves.</description>

      <title>add support for TLS-SRP, rfc5054</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9b1) Gecko/2007110903 Firefox/3.0b1 Build Identifier: Attached patches enhance NSS with SRP authentication in TLS. A very basic softtoken has been added, so that PK11_PubDerive() and PK11_GenerateKeyPair() can be used. I've tried to break the algorithm in to pieces that match the usual procedures, i.e. create pubkey/prvkey get the peers pubkey and derive a common secret. I've considered that real tokens, storing long-term secrets v at the server or P and the client, could be in use may or may not actually know the secret. So the interfaces are such that the application is always asked for the parameters, which may then be overridden by real tokens in the GenerateKeyPair-steps. In case some parameters are not provided, no error is reported until entering the softoken code. Contrary to suggestions on nss-dev, IMO the key derivation must not be broken down further, using other token/softtoken, as this would allow attacks on (hypothetical) real SRP tokens. The GenerateKeyPair() for the client happens to be a simple ephermal DH key pair with a different secret key bitlength. For consistency, I nevertheless created a function in freebl/srp.c. srp.h contains the group parameters from the rfc in base64, as well as a few other constants. Its exported and used in the applications as well. A new app cmd/srputil is introduced to manage the verifier file (think: pw-hashes at the server). cmd/tstclient and cmd/SSLSample/server have been modified to provide login information(username/pass resp. verifier-data) to SSL. There is a non-interactive SSL_SetUserLogin function and an interactive callback to set the password after the server key exchange is received. This way, the UI could ask the users password only after certificate was validated and displayed. It's unfortunate that the server app needs to know the srp group parameters to supply them along with the verifier to the server SSL code. This should maybe be changed to optionally supply only a groupid that SSL looks up in srp.h itself. The patch works with bypass and PK11-paths, all group sizes specified in the rfc, optional rsa or dsa server certificates. It works against the old patched openssl library and, by changing the tls ids, with gnutls 2.1.6. And of course nss itself. I tell all this of course so that (hopefully small) issues I'm not aware of can be brought forward without reading all the code. Oh, maybe someone also knows why dsa certifcates are indexed with kt_null. How do you use it? create a verifier file: srputil -a -u user1 -p mypass -s vfile start a server: server -p 4433 -s vfile -d certs -n rsa_server start a client: tstclnt -o -3 -2 -c :c01b -h 127.0.0.1 -p 4433 -d certs -l user1 -k mypass Both programs accept -B for bypass-mode.

      <title>Remove the "Information" button at the right of every download row</title>
      <description>[actually nominating for wanted] As shown in this mockup (attached to bug 397655) : https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=288692 As of bug 405884 (show date and time for each download), all of the user tasks associated with information behind the information button are supported even without the button. See below for the reasoning. Given that fact, the value of having a button here is outweighed by the simplicity we can achieve by removing it. Rationale: No need for the source URL: The two user-tasks associated with seeing the source information are (a) going there and (b) using some part of that information to tell you what the download is. In the first case, we've supported that by making "Go to Source Location" (and copy for good measure) available in the right-click menu, which is a shorter path than viewing, copying, opening a tab, and pasting. In the latter (b), we made this simpler by listing the TLD inline with each download. No need for the local location: The tasks are (a) getting to the download to launch it, and (b) to see where you put it. Double-clicking the row (or, for discoverability, right-clicking) launches the download, so that's (a) covered. As for (b), "Open Containing Folder"/"Show in Finder" is in the right-click menu. No need for the date/time: As of bug 405884, the date/time is put in a location that's better suited to its use in helping users find the downloads that they're looking for. In other words, we've supported the user tasks (in fact, made them quicker!) while streamlining the UI.</description>

      <title>Accept title and text as arguments while creating permission manager dialog</title>
      <description>Created attachment 291143 [details] [diff] [review] Proposed patch The strings for title and introduction text for the permission manager dialogs are always taken from mozilla/suite/common/permissions/permissionsManager.properties While it's convenient for creating the default kinds of dialogs (install, popup, image), it requires non trivial work to create new permission manager dialogs (for extensions, for instance). Firefox already uses parameters for such dialogs. As install (extensions), popup, image and also cookies use that dialog without requiring parameters and for some internal uses (ones where you can edit permissionsManager.properties and bother localizers) it's convenient for them to be optional, it's better to leave it as an optional parameter instead of requiring it as in FX. I'm not making any other check than SM has today. It is, it won't work today if you use another type than popup, image or install and it won't work if you specify such type without providing title and text. I'd prefered to stick with the same argument names as FX, because it allows clients to use our API without modification (and the use for the arguments is fairly the same).</description>

      <title>Modern Navigator (large/small) button icon graphics need to be converted to a .PNG and the background made alpha transparent</title>
      <description>Created attachment 291434 [details] suite/themes/modern/navigator/icons/btn1.gif See Bug 394288 Comment #13. When customizable toolbars is enabled in Navigator, the graphics for the modern navigation buttons look out of place mostly because they use a hard-coded gradient as the background. Currently I am using a variant from the modern aluminium theme but I think we might need to check the copyrights and licensing on this if the SeaMonkey council agrees to check this in. Alternatively someone with more graphic skills than I do can proceed to convert the existing modern btn1.gif into a .png with an alpha transparent background. I /think/ there is a subtle drop shadow in this that isn't in the modern aluminium theme.</description>

      <title>In OSX The customizeToolbars window should be in a &lt;panel&gt; popup.</title>
      <description>https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=394288#c40 [quote] Using the dialog has 2 issues: 1) Mac users would expect the whole, original, menubar to stay unaffected when the customizetoolbar window opens. This will require that your new window has a menubar - the widget code takes the menubar from the frontmost window and puts it at the top of the desktop. This is probably one of the reasons why toolkit has that iframe-hack on mac. 2) Once you click on the toolbar, the dialog vanishes behind the navigator window. While 1) is something we could live with (we have the same issue in lots of other dialogs), this problem is a bit worse since you can only drag stuff from the dialog to the toolbar. Thinking of it, this might be the main reason why it's done different on mac. [/quote] See Bug 250129 and Bug 350282 For the Firefox equivalent and Bug 394873 for the Thunderbird equivalent.</description>

      <title>read OpenType MATH table for variants and parts of stretchy characters</title>
      <description>Microsoft have used a MATH table as an extension to OpenType in their Cambria Math font, that contains much information about typesetting mathematics. Notably it contains the information that we have stored in mathfontFONT.properties files for variants and parts of stretchy characters, but it provides glyph ids instead of character code points. Being able to read the information from the font would be much better than maintaining our own tables. The only other currently available font that I can find having variant and construction (from part) information in these tables is Asana Math. STIX seem to have no intention at this stage of including this information in their fonts. (See the response to the comment dated 19 November at http://www.stixfonts.org/feedback-glyphs.html) In the case of Cambria Math, variant and part glyphs that do not have a corresponding Unicode code point have no entries in the cmaps, so we cannot use a character code point table in its current form to access these glyphs. The best way to get detailed information on these tables is by emailing Sergey Malkin. Implementations for accessing these tables exist in fontforge (http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/math.html) and XeTeX.</description>

      <title>Support for Asana Math font in MathML</title>
      <description>Asana Math is available under the LaTeX Project Public License and "includes almost all mathematical Unicode symbols". http://tug.ctan.org/pkg/asana-math Currently there is a more recent version here: http://openfontlibrary.org/media/files/asyropoulos/213 It also includes variants sizes and parts for large character construction similar to Cambria Math and include a MATH OpenType table. A notable advantage over Cambria Math (as well as the licence) as that Asana Math provides Unicode Mappings for these variants and parts in the Supplementary Private Use Area-B (plane 16). This means that we can use a mathfontAsanaMath.properties file to specify the glyphs (characters), but we need to add support to nsMathMLChar for non-BMP code points. The appropriate characters for the properties file can be obtained by viewing the MATH table variant and construction entries in fontforge and finding the PUA code points for those glyph ids. Bug 289938 needs to be fixed for Unicode Plane 1 characters. This font has no italic nor bold style for alphanumeric characters in plane 0 as they exist at their unique code points in plane 1. To ensure that &lt;mi&gt;a&lt;/mi&gt; is displayed as italic we either need to complete the mathvariant translation to plane 1 (bug 114365) or we need to ensure that synthetic italic and bold are functional (e.g. bug 333126). I've marked severity as enhancement, but it would be nice to get this into 1.9 as we no longer support the TeX Computer Modern fonts, and this font could be a good replacement.</description>

If we implement this, localizers won't have to localize the whole template, just the actual strings in the template.

WebKit uses a method of attaching the an clipboardData object to the onpaste event. This method is better since it only gives JS access to the clipboard contents when the user performs an paste action. This is how WebKit does it, contents can be retrieved from the onpaste event object: eventObj.clipboardData.getData('text/plain'); While in IE you can use, this enables to to retrieve the contents at any time: window.clipboardData.getData('Text'); IE and WebKit have only the ability to return plain text contents ideal would be to have the ability to get the rich HTML contents to be used in Midas/designMode implementations.

But when trying to access a web page with a certificate issued by that entity, a warning is displayed by the web browser. This will be increased in Firefox 3 as instead of displaying a warning it will show a web page with the error but nothing of the web page is displayed. I don't know whether the problem is that Mozilla does not recognize the FNMT as an SSL Certificates certifying entity or there is another problem.

      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9b2pre) Gecko/2007120604 Minefield/3.0b2pre Build Identifier: Here is a patch for symbolstore.py to gather up and index pdb files created when a debug-info build is made. It uses pdbstr.exe which comes with the Debugging Tools for Windows and assumes that pdbstr.exe is in mozilla/toolkit/crashreporter/tools/win32 When make buildsymbols is called, this new version of symbolstore.py creates .stream files with the proper syntax for source indexed data blocks and calls on pdbstr to write it into the pdd files. On the user end, your PATH must contain cvs.exe and in your debugger (Visual Studio or Windbg) you must enable source server as well. Currently there is just one sample available to test out (an installer and a package of corresponding symbols) here: http://crashopensource.wordpress.com/2007/12/12/03-release-of-the-source-server-for-mozilla-firefox/trackback/ Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.</description>

      <title>Thunderbird should have session restore</title>
      <description>There's not a lot of state that gets lost when you restart Thunderbird, but there's a few things that would be nice to preserve across a restart: 1) scroll positions within mailboxes 2) "unseen" message indicators on folders (as opposed to "unread"). In current incarnations of Thunderbird this is the blue highlight on a folder. It gets lost when you restart Thunderbird, whether you actually looked at the mailbox or not. 3) which mailbox you currently had open 4) any compose windows you might have had open at the time 5) message windows that were open for reading</description>

      <title>Preference to control cross-session download behaviour</title>
      <description>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9b3pre) Gecko/2007121605 Minefield/3.0b3pre Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9b3pre) Gecko/2007121605 Minefield/3.0b3pre As per bug 408555, although cross-session download resumption has been implemented, there is no way to control this behaviour, and any active/paused downloads will automatically resume next time Minefield is opened. For some users, this may pose a privacy risk. Bug 256620, comment 1 suggested one possible way of implementing this, although if the user has multiple tabs open which trigger the save tabs dialog, this may cause user fatigue. An option could also be provided in either Tools-&gt;Options-&gt;Main under downloads, or Tools-Options-&gt;Privacy, perhaps as part of the "Clear private data on exit" options. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Start downloading a file that would cause you personal or professional embarrassment if anyone else ever saw that you had downloaded it. 2. Exit and restart Firefox. 3. Download resumes. Actual Results: On restart the download resumes. Embarrassment ensues. Expected Results: The download should not resume if user wishes for unfinished downloads to cancel at end of browsing sessions.</description>

      <description>Mockup and notes: http://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox:Add-ons_Manager_UI#Scary_Confirmation The redesign is an attempt to do the following: - remove redundant and confusing messages from the dialog - elevate the warning, rather than the list of add-ons, to primacy in the dialog. The point of the dialog, after all, is the warning -- the list of add-ons is just to give some context for the warning - make the "Signed" or "Unsigned" status, currently expressed in those terms and red lettering, something that is more user-understandable.</description>

      <title>FUEL: provide a way to perform bookmark queries</title>
      <description>Right now the only way of finding bookmarks in FUEL is to recursively iterate folders beginning with the root. Because the assumption is that in Firefox 3 users are going to accumulate a lot of bookmarks, this could be not efficient enough (not to mention inconvenient). I talked about it a little with Mark Finkle and we agreed that it would be useful if FUEL provided an interface for querying bookmarks, as a wrapper for nsINavHistoryQuery and friends. An example of how it could look like in action: var query = bookmarks.newQuery(); query.type = "folder"; query.searchTerms = "goats"; var results = query.execute();</description>
